As a software developer and technologist  I've worked on a number of civic technology projects over the years. Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good  using technology to solve humanitarian problems. This is in      in Uganda  working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent. That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control. But over the years  as I have thought about these technologies and the things that I work on  a question kind of nags in the back of my mind  which is  what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology  and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we're intending to help  The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things  it will positively affect everyone. Eventually  these innovations will get out and find everyone. But that's not always the case. I like to call this blind championing of technology  trickle down techonomics   to borrow a phrase.  Laughter  We tend to think that if we design things for the select few  eventually those technologies will reach everyone  and that's not always the case. Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital. They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few  and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many. And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends  so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable. In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps  there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough. These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient  and in turn  these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies. As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms  and they become digitally ready  what happens to the digitally invisible  What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the      phone or watch tracking their every movement  Do they now become a burden on the medical system  Is their experience changed  In the world of finance  Bitcoin and crypto currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world  but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high  right  You need access to the same phones  devices  connectivity  and even where you don't  where you can find a proxy agent  usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate. And so the question that I ask myself is  what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency  Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia  I recently went to the public library there  and they are facing an existential crisis. Public funding is dwindling  they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant  and so one of the ways they're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud. This is great for most kids. Right  You can check out books from home  you can research on the way to school or from school  but these are really two big assumptions  that one  you have access at home  and two  that you have access to a mobile phone  and in Philadelphia  many kids do not. So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud based library  what used to be considered such a basic part of education  How do they stay competitive  A final example from across the world in East Africa  there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights  for a number of reasons. Migrant communities  older generations dying off  and ultimately poor record keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what. And so there was a big movement to put all this information online  to track all the ownership of these plots of land  put them in the cloud  and give them to the communities. But actually  the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists  investors  real estate developers  have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities  because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible. So that's the common thread that connects these examples  the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make. As engineers  as technologists  we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy. We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing. This needs to change. We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build  especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live. In the late '  s  there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking. I think in       we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology. So  I just encourage you  as you are all thinking about the next big thing  as entrepreneurs  as CEOs  as engineers  as makers  that you think about the unintended consequences of the things that you're building  because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone. Thank you. In the summer of       as a tourist  I visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time  and as you might imagine  it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most. There's this constant cacophony of noise. Some things actually do stick out. For example  this here is a big bird  a rhinoceros hornbill. This buzzing is a cicada. This is a family of gibbons. It's actually singing to each other over a great distance. The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve  which is why you can hear so many of them  but in fact the most important noise that  was coming out of the forest that time was one that I didn't notice  and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it. So  as I said  this was a gibbon reserve. They spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons  but they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side. And so if we take the sound of the forest and we actually turn down the gibbons  the insects  and the rest  in the background  the entire time  in recordings you heard  was the sound of a chainsaw at great distance. They had three full time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging  and one day  we went walking  again as tourists  out into the forest  and within five minutes' walk  we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down  five minutes' walk  a few hundred meters from the ranger station. They hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws  because as you heard  the forest is very  very loud. It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time  just a few hundred meters away  from a ranger station in a sanctuary  that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up. It sounds impossible  but in fact  it was quite true. So how do we stop illegal logging  It's really tempting  as an engineer  always to come up with a high tech  super crazy high tech solution  but in fact  you're in the rainforest. It has to be simple  it has to be scalable  and so what we also noticed while were there was that everything we needed was already there. We could build a system that would allow us to stop this using what's already there. Who was there  What was  already in the forest  Well  we had people. We had this group there that was  dedicated  three full time guards  that was dedicated to go and stop it  but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest. The real surprise  this is the big one  was that there was connectivity out in the forest. There was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere. We're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road  there's certainly no electricity  but they had very good cell phone service  these people in the towns were on Facebook all the time  they're surfing the web on their phones  and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest  pick up the sounds  of chainsaws programmatically  because people can't hear them  and send an alert. But you have to have a device to go up in the trees. So if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest  connect to the cell phone network that's there  and send an alert to people on the ground  perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them. But let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest  because it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever. People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids  and it seems that the message has never changed  We've got to save the rainforest  it's super urgent  this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday. and yet here we are today  about half of the rainforest remains  and we have potentially more urgent  problems like climate change. But in fact  this is the little known fact that I didn't realize at the time  Deforestation accounts  for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes  trains  cars  trucks and ships combined. It's the second highest contributor to climate change. Also  according to Interpol  as much as    percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging  like the illegal logging that we saw. So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there  then in fact we could eat heavily into this    percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term. It might just be the cheapest  fastest way to fight climate change. And so here's the system that we imagine. It looks super high tech. The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest  the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw  it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging. It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut. It's not about seeing  a tree from a satellite in an area that's been clear cut  it's about real time intervention. So I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it  but in fact  actually  as you saw  they weren't able to do it  so it may not be so cheap and fast. But if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones  it could be pretty cheap. Cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year  hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone  not counting the rest of the world  which of course we should do  but in fact  cell phones are great. They're full of sensors. They can listen to the sounds of the forest. We do have to protect them. We have to put them in this box that you see here  and we do have to power them. Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with  because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy  any sort of solar power under a tree canopy  was an as yet unsolved problem  and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here  which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process. These are strips that are cut down. So this is me putting it all together in my parents' garage  actually. Thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that. As you can see  this is a device up in a tree. What you can see from here  perhaps  is that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance. That's important  because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance  allowing them to cover about three square kilometers  if someone were to take them  it would make the area unprotected. So does it actually work  Well  to test it  we took it back to Indonesia  not the same place  but another place  to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging. On the very second day  it picked up illegal chainsaw noises. We were able to get a real time alert. I got an email on my phone. Actually  we had just climbed the tree. Everyone had just gotten back down. All these guys are smoking cigarettes  and then I get an email  and they all quiet down  and in fact you can hear the chainsaw really  really faint in the background  but no one had noticed it  until that moment. And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers. I was pretty nervous. This is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are. This is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor. I'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill. That guy's much braver than I am. But he went  so I had to go  walking up  and in fact  he made it over the hill  and interrupted the loggers in the act. For them  it was such a surprise    they had never  ever been interrupted before    that it was such an impressive event for them  that we've heard from our partners they have not been back since. They were  in fact  great guys. They showed us how the entire operation works  and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if you can show up in real time and stop people  it's enough of a deterrent they won't come back. So    Thank you.  Applause  Word of this spread  possibly because we told a lot of people  and in fact  then some really amazing stuff started to happen. People from around the world started to send us emails  phone calls. What we saw was that people throughout Asia  people throughout Africa  people throughout South America  they told us that they could use it too  and what's most important  what we'd found that we thought might be exceptional  in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service. That was not exceptional  we were told  and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat. And then something  really amazing happened  which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones. So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground  people who are already there  who can both improve and use the existing connectivity  and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing  something else in their afterlife  so to speak. And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled  then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device. So again  this didn't come because of any sort of high tech solution. It just came from using what's already there  and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones  that there's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts. Thank you very much. My name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name. If your name was Harry Baker  then our names would be the same. It's a short introductory part. Yeah  I'm Harry. I study maths. I write poetry. So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers. This is called    .  I was going to call it  Prime Time Loving.  That reaction is why I didn't. So     .     wakes up on the wrong  side of the bed. Realizes all his hair is  on one side of his head. Takes just under a minute to work out that it s because of the way that he slept. He finds some clothes and gets dressed. He can t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed How he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed. And as he glances out the window  he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of    from across the street. Now    was beautiful. With perfectly trimmed cuticles  dressed in something suitable. Never rude or crude at all. Unimprovable  right on time as usual  more on cue than a snooker ball but liked to play it super cool.    wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower. He thought of her every second  every minute  every hour. But he knew it wouldn t work  he d never get the girl. Because although she lived  across the street they came from different worlds. While    admired    s perfectly round figure     thought    was odd.  Laughter  One of his favorite films was      Dalmatians.  She preferred the sequel. He romanticized the idea they were star crossed lovers. They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other. While she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother That separate could not be equal. And though at the time he felt stupid and dumb For trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum  He should have been comforted by the simple sum. Take    away from     and you re left with the one. Sure enough after two months of moping around     days later     was who he found  He had lost his keys  and his parents were out. So one day after school  he went into a house As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door  He wondered why he d never introduced himself before  As she let him in  his jaw  dropped in awe.    was like     but a little bit more.  Laughter  She had prettier eyes  and an approachable smile  And like him  rough around the edges  casual style  And like him  everything was in disorganized piles  And like him  her mum didn t mind if friends stayed a while. Because she was like him   and he liked her. He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her  And it was different this time. I mean  this girl was wicked  So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits. She said   I'm   .  He grinned  said   I'm   .  Today I ve had a really nice time  So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine  She said   Sure.  She loved talking to someone  just as quirky  She agreed to this unofficial first date. In the end he was only ready one minute early  But it didn t matter because she arrived one minute late. And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter  How they loved  X Factor   how they had two factors  How that did not matter  distinctiveness made them better  By the end of the night they knew they were meant together. And one day she was talking about stuck up     She noticed that    looked a bit shifty. He blushed  told her of his crush   The best thing that never happened because it led to us.     was clever  see  not prone to jealousy  She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly   You re     I m     together we combine to become twice what    could ever be.  At this point    had tears in his eyes  Was so glad to have this one of a kind girl in his life. He told her the very definition of being prime Was that with only one and himself could his heart divide  And she was the one he wanted to give his heart to  She said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true. Because that wasn't real love  that love was just a sample  When it came to real love  they were a prime example. Cheers. That was the first poem that I wrote and it was for a prime number themed  poetry night     Laughter     which turned out to be a prime number themed poetry competition. And I became a prime number themed poetry competition winner  or as I like to call it  a prime minister.  Laughter  And this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams  and if you don't know what  a poetry slam is  it was a format come up with in America    years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events by putting an exciting word like  slam  on the end. And each performer got three minutes to perform and then random audience members would hold up scorecards  and they would end up with a numerical score  and what this meant is  it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener. And what it also means is you can win. And if you win a poetry slam  you can call yourself a slam champion and pretend you're a wrestler  and if you lose a poetry slam you can say   Oh  what  Poetry's a subjective art form  you can't put numbers on such things.  But I loved it  and I got involved in these slams  and I became the U.K. slam champion and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris  which was unbelievable. It was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five French strangers. And somehow  I won  which was great  and I've been able to travel the world since doing it  but it also means that this next piece is technically the best poem in the world. So... According to five French strangers. So this is  Paper People.  I like people. I'd like some paper people. They d be purple paper people. Maybe pop up purple paper people. Proper pop up purple paper people.  How do you prop up pop up purple paper people   I hear you cry. Well I ... I d probably prop up proper pop up purple paper people with a proper pop up purple people paperclip  but I d pre prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives  a cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped. Because I could build a pop up metropolis. but I wouldn t wanna deal with all the paper people politics. paper politicians with their paper thin policies  broken promises without appropriate apologies. There d be a little paper me. And a little paper you. And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay per view. We d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A . There d be a paper princess Kate but we d all stare at paper Pippa  and then we d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper Ripper  because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices  papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists. A little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people s problems pop up too. There d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch  and who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts  then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces  by the confetti cannons manned by pre emptive police. And yes there d still be paper money  so there d still be paper greed  and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need  purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties  others live in poverty and ain t acknowledged properly. A proper poor economy where so many are proper poor  but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars. Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains  but the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same  what changes is who s in power choosing how to lay the blame  they re naming names  forgetting these are names of people  because in the end it all comes down to people. I like people. 'Cause even when the situation s dire  it is only ever people who are able to inspire  and on paper  it s hard to see how we all cope. But in the bottom of Pandora s box there s still hope  and I still hope 'cause I believe in people. People like my grandparents. Who every single day since I was born  have taken time out of their morning to pray for me. That s      days straight of someone checking I m okay  and that s amazing. People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners. People who are capable of genuine forgiveness. People like the persecuted Palestinians. People who go out of their way to make your life better  and expect nothing in return. You see  people have potential to be powerful. Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims we don t need to succumb to that system. And a paper population is no different. There s a little paper me. And a little paper you. And in a pop up population people's problems pop up too  but even if the whole world fell apart then we d still make it through. Because we re people. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've just got time for one more. For me  poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers. When I first started  the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories  and I thought  as an    year old with a happy life  it was too normal  but I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences and dreams and beliefs. So it's amazing to be here in front of you today. Thank you for being here. If you weren't here  it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday. And this is more fun. So this last one is called  The Sunshine Kid.  Thank you very much for listening. Old man sunshine was proud of his sun  And it brightened his day to see his little boy run  Not because of what he d done  nor the problems overcome  But that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one. It hadn t always been like this. There d been times when he d tried to hide his brightness  You see  every star hits periods of hardship  It takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness. If we go back to when he was born in a nebula  We know that he never was thought of as regular  Because he had a flair about him  To say the Midas touch is wrong But all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze  Yes this sun was loved by some more than others  It was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers Because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons  And jealousy created enemies in those he outshone Such as the Shadow People. Now the Shadow People didn t like the Sunshine Kid  Because he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did  And when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid  So the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him  First up    they made fun of his sunspots  Shooting his dreams from the sky  their words were gunshots  Designed to remind him he wasn t very cool And he didn t fit in with any popular kids at school. They said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth  Essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth  He d never get to go to university to learn  Only degrees he d ever show would be the first degree burns From those that came too close  they told him he was too bright  That s why no one ever looked him in the eyes  His judgment became clouded So did the sky  With evaporated tears as the sun started to cry. Because the sunshine kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely Hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities  And as his heart hardened  his spark darkened  Every time they called him names it cooled his flames  He thought they might like him if he kept his light dim But they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim  He couldn t quite get to grips with what they said  So he let his light be eclipsed by what they said  He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas  And felt like he d been punched in his solar plexus. But that s when Little Miss Sunshine came along Singing her favorite song about how we re made to be strong  And you don t have to be wrong to belong  Just be true to who you are  because we are all stars at heart. Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff  The kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff  But for him  there was no forgetting her  The minute he saw her her image burned in his retina  She was out of this world  and she accepted him  Something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him  Things weren t as dark as they seemed  and he dared to dream  Shadows were nowhere to be seen  when she was there he beamed  His eyes would light up in ways that can t be faked  When she grinned her rays erased the razor tipped words of hate  They gave each other nicknames  they were  cool star  and  fun sun   And gradually the shadowy damage became undone  She was one in a septillion  and she was brilliant  Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion  Loved by billions  from Chileans to Brazilians  And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience. She said   All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle So how the hell can they handle your light  Only you can choose to dim it  and the sky is the limit  so silence the critics by burning.  And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains And let the sun shine through the hurting. In a universe of adversity these stars stuck together  And though days became nights the memories would last forever  Whether the weatherman said it or not  it would be fine  'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine. Yes  the Sunshine Kid was bright  with a warm personality  And inside he burned savagely  Fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies By the girl who showed him belief. Thank you very much. Twenty five years ago  scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web. Since then  the Internet has transformed  the way we communicate  the way we do business  and even the way we live. In many ways  the ideas that gave birth to Google  Facebook  Twitter  and so many others  have now really transformed our lives  and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society. However  there are also some downsides to this. Today  the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online  and we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook  each time we search on Google  and each time we send an email. Now  many of us probably think  well  one email  there's nothing in there  right  But if you consider a year's worth of emails  or maybe even a lifetime of email  collectively  this tells a lot. It tells where we have been  who we have met  and in many ways  even what we're thinking about. And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever  so your data can and will outlive you. What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy. So this year  as the web turns     it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this. We have to really think. We've lost privacy  yes  but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself. If you think about it  most of us here today probably remember  what life was like before the Internet  but today  there's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online  and this is a generation that is not  going to remember when data was private. So we keep going down this road     years from now  the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and I. So  it's time for us  to take a moment and think  is there anything we can do about this  And I believe there is. Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today  email. Before the invention of email  we largely communicated using letters  and the process was quite simple. You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper  then you would place it into a sealed envelope  and from there  you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it. Unfortunately  today  when we actually send an email  we're not sending a letter. What you are sending  in many ways  is actually a postcard  and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents. So  the solution to this has been known for some time  and there's many attempts to do it. The most basic solution is to use encryption  and the idea is quite simple. First  you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server. Then  you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself. But there's a problem with this  and that is  the email servers also hold the encryption keys  so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it. But not only that  any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data  and this is all without you being aware of it. So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy  in principle  You give everybody their own keys  and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys. This seems like common sense  right  So the question that comes up is  why hasn't this been done yet  Well  if we really think about it  we see that the business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy. Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web  and you see that advertising plays a huge role. In fact  this year alone  advertising is     billion dollars  and to optimize the ads that are shown to us  companies have to know everything about us. They need to know where we live  how old we are  what we like  what we don't like  and anything else they can get their hands on. And if you think about it  the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy. So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy. If we want to have privacy online  what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves. For many years  when it came to email  the only solution was something known as PGP  which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy. Here's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages. So needless to say  this is not a solution for everybody  and this actually is part of the problem  because if you think about communication  by definition  it involves having someone to communicate with. So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do  for the people out there who can't understand how to use it  the option to communicate privately simply does not exist. And this is a problem that we need to solve. So if we want to have privacy online  the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board  and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry. I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community. What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible. So last summer  when the Edward Snowden story came out  several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen. At that time  we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider  which collides protons  by the way. We were all scientists  so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project  ProtonMail.  Laughter  Many startups these days actually begin in people's garages or people's basements. We were a bit different. We started out at the CERN cafeteria  which actually is great  because look  you have all the food and water you could ever want. But even better than this is that every day between    p.m. and   p.m.  free of charge  the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers  and these guys basically know the answers to everything. So it was in this environment that we began working. What we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this  but more importantly  we want to do it in a way that you can't even tell that it's happened. So to do this  we actually need a combination of technology and also design. So how do we go about doing something like this  Well  it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server. So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer  and we don't generate a single key  but actually a pair of keys  so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key  and these keys are mathematically connected. So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate. So here we have Bob and Alice  who want to communicate privately. So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message. So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer  and one of the tricks is  we encrypt it using the public key from Alice. Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice  and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key  the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice  and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key. So we've now accomplished the objective  which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on. Actually  what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture. The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this. And that's actually the key design challenge  How do we take all this complexity  all this software  and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it. I think with ProtonMail  we have gotten pretty close to doing this. So let's see how it works in practice. Here  we've got Bob and Alice again  who also want to communicate securely. They simply create accounts on ProtonMail  which is quite simple and takes a few moments  and all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as Bob is creating his account. Once his account is created  he just clicks  compose   and now he can write his email like he does today. So he fills in his information  and then after that   all he has to do is click  send   and just like that  without understanding cryptography  and without doing anything different from how he writes email today  Bob has just sent an encrypted message. What we have here is really just the first step  but it shows that with improving technology  privacy doesn't have to be difficult  it doesn't have to be disruptive. If we change the goal from maximizing  ad revenue to protecting data  we can actually make it accessible. Now  I know a question on everybody's minds is  okay  protecting privacy  this is a great goal  but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you  And I think the answer is actually yes  because today  we've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is  and when you have that  anything is possible. Earlier this year  ProtonMail actually had so many users  that we ran out of resources  and when this happened  our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars. So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal. We can also leverage the world. Right now  we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail  and these people come from everywhere  and this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue  it's a global issue that impacts all of us. It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward. So what do we have to do to solve this problem  Well  first of all  we need to support a different business model for the Internet  one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth. We actually need to build a new Internet where our privacy and our ability  to control our data is first and foremost. But even more importantly  we have to build an Internet  where privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default. We have done the first step with ProtonMail  but this is really just the first step in a very  very long journey. The good news I can share with you guys today  the exciting news  is that we're not traveling alone. The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum  and today  there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy. These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications  also our file storage  our online search  our online browsing  and many other things. And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising  but they've found support really from the people  from private individuals like you and I from all over the world. This really matters  because ultimately  privacy depends on each and every one of us  and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros. It's actually a lot more than that. It's our lives  our personal stories  our friends  our families  and in many ways  also our hopes and our aspirations. We need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with  because without this  we simply can't have a free society. So now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say  yes  we do want to live in a world with online privacy  and yes  we can work together to turn this vision into a reality. Thank you. About    years ago  I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place. This involved a journey into national and global advocacy and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world. In the process  I became a civil society diplomat. Civil society diplomats do three things  They voice the concerns of the people  are not pinned down by national interests  and influence change through citizen networks  not only state ones. And if you want to change the world  we need more of them. But many people still ask   Can civil society really make a big difference  Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy   I never thought I would ask myself these questions  but here I am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society  movements that I've been involved in. They are in issues that I'm passionate about  gun control and drug policy. And these are issues that matter here. Latin America is ground zero for both of them. For example  Brazil    this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record. We are the number one champion in homicidal violence. One in every    people killed around the world is a Brazilian. This translates into over        people dying violently each year. Most of them are young  black boys dying by guns. Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs  and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here. Around    percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil are related to the War on Drugs. The same is true for about    percent of people in jail. And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs. Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble. Latin America has nine percent of the world's population  but    percent of its global violent deaths. These are not problems we can run away from. I certainly could not. So the first campaign I got involved with started here in      to change Brazil's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons. In just a few years  we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun  but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons. This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history    but we also suffered some setbacks. We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in     . The second initiative was also home grown  but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime. I am the executive coordinator of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy. The commission is a high level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs. Since we started in       the taboo on drugs is broken. Across the Americas  from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay  change is in the air. But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements  I just want to share with you four key insights. I call them lessons to change the world. There are certainly many more  but these are the ones that stand out to me. So the first lesson is  Change and control the narrative. It may seem obvious  but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative. This is something that veteran politicians understand  but that civil society groups generally do not do very well. In the case of drug policy  our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a War on Drugs to putting people's health and safety first. In a cutting edge report we just launched in New York  we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this      billion market are criminal gangs and cartels. So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups  we need to change the conversation. We need to make illegal drugs legal. But before I get you too excited  I don't mean drugs should be a free for all. What I'm talking about  and what the Global Commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market  where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation. As for gun control  we were successful in changing  but not so much in controlling  the narrative. And this brings me to my next lesson  Never underestimate your opponents. If you want to succeed in changing the world  you need to know who you're up against. You need to learn their motivations and points of view. In the case of gun control  we really underestimated our opponents. After a very successful gun collection program  we were elated. We had support from    percent of Brazilians  and thought that this could help us win the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians. But we were dead wrong. During a televised    day public debate  our opponent used our own arguments against us. We ended up losing the popular vote. It was really terrible. The National Rifle Association    yes  the American NRA    came to Brazil. They inundated our campaign with their propaganda  that as you know  links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy. They simply threw everything at us. They used our national flag  our independence anthem. They invoked women's rights and misused images of Mandela  Tiananmen Square  and even Hitler. They won by playing with people's fears. In fact  guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign. Their focus was on individual rights. But I ask you  which right is more important  the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away  We thought people would vote in defense of life  but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship  the anti government message of our opponents resonated  and we were not prepared to respond. Lesson learned. We've been more successful in the case of drug policy. If you asked most people    years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible  they would have laughed. After all  there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments benefiting from this war. But today  the international drug control regime is starting to crumble. Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches. The Global Commission on Drug Policy really knew its opposition  and rather than fighting them  our chair    former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso    reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum  from liberals to conservatives. This high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies. It was this reasoned  informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric. Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever  and consumption has risen globally. But even worse  it also generated massive negative unintended consequences. It is true that some people have made these arguments before  but we've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change. Third lesson  Use data to drive your argument. Guns and drugs are emotive issues  and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil  sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts. But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. Until quite recently  we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns. Amazingly  it was a local soap opera called  Mulheres Apaixonadas     or  Women in Love     that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign. In one highly viewed episode  a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet. Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged  and in a case of art imitating life  this episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here  outside in Copacabana Beach. The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion. Within weeks  our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years. We were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program. Here is what I mean  We could prove that in just one year  we saved more than       lives. And in the case of drugs  in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue  we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se  and people are starting to get it. My fourth insight is  Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows. What we've learned in Brazil    and this doesn't only apply to my country    is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together. If you want to change the world  it helps to have a good cross section of society on your side. In both the case of guns and drugs  we brought together a wonderful mix of people. We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media. We gathered the victims  human rights champions  cultural icons. We also assembled the professional classes    doctors  lawyers  academia and more. What I've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change. In the case of drugs  we needed libertarians  anti prohibitionists  legalizers  and liberal politicians. They may not agree on everything  in fact  they disagree on almost everything. But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view. Over a decade ago  I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank. I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy as you can imagine. But I took a chance. I changed course  and on the way  I helped  to create social movements that I believe have made  some parts of the world safer. Each and every one of us has the power to change the world. No matter what the issue  and no matter how hard the fight  civil society is central to the blueprint for change. Thank you. Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well. After one trillion dollars in African development related aid in the last    years  real per capita income today is lower than it was in the     s. Aid is not doing too well. In response  the Bretton Woods institutions    the IMF and the World Bank    pushed for free trade not aid  yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth. The newly prescribed  silver bullet is microcredit. We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur. Yet my work and travel in    plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead. My solution  Forget micro entrepreneurs. Let's invest in building pan African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim. Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '   and built it into a mobile  cellular provider with    million subscribers across    African countries by     . The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model  which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge sharing. Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition. Consider these two alternative scenarios. One  You loan     dollars  to each of     banana farmers allowing them to dry  their surplus bananas and fetch    percent more revenue at the local market. Or two  You give         dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields    percent additional income to all     banana farmers and creates    additional jobs. We invested in the second scenario  and backed    year old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten free banana based flour and baby food. Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers  who have an ownership in the business. Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim  which requires skill  financing  local and global partnerships  and extraordinary perseverance. But why pan African  The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of         where  quite frankly  we Africans were not exactly consulted    resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations  Liberia  four million  Cape Verde         . Pan Africa gives you one billion people  granted across    countries with trade barriers and other impediments  but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us. The pan African opportunities outweigh the challenges  and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria  Nigeria  Ghana  and anywhere else that will buy our food. We hope to help solve food security  empower farmers  create jobs  develop the local economy  and we hope to become rich in the process. While it's not the sexiest approach  and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel good as giving a woman     dollars  to buy a goat on kiva.org  perhaps supporting fewer  higher impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan Africa can help change this. The political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom. We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world class businesses  creating indigenous wealth  providing jobs that we so desperately need  and hopefully helping achieve this. Africa shall rise. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Sangu  of course  this is strong rhetoric. You're making     percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment. Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all  Sangu Delle  I think there is a role. Microcredit has been a great  innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid. But for the problems we face in Africa  when we are looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize war torn Europe  it was not full of donations of sheep. We need more than just microcredit. We need more than just give     dollars. We need to build big businesses  and we need jobs. TR  Very good. Thank you so much. Today I'm going to speak to you about the last    years of architectural history. That's a lot to pack into    minutes. It's a complex topic  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place  New Jersey. Because    years ago  I'm from Jersey  and I was six  and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called Livingston  and this was my childhood bedroom. Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister. And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room. And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom  everyone would see me  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel  everyone would see me. And I looked like this. I was awkward  insecure  and I hated it. I hated that walk  I hated that balcony  I hated that room  and I hated that house. And that's architecture. Done. That feeling  those emotions that I felt  that's the power of architecture  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning  it's about those visceral  emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occupy. And it's no surprise that we feel that way  because according to the EPA  Americans spend    percent of their time indoors. That's    percent of our time surrounded by architecture. That's huge. That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize. That makes us a little bit gullible and very  very predictable. It means that when I show you a building like this  I know what you think  You think  power  and  stability  and  democracy.  And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build       years ago by the Greeks. This is a trick. This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of. It's a predictable emotional connection  and we've been using this trick for a long  long time. We used it       years ago to build banks. We used it in the   th century to build art museums. And in the   th century in America  we used it to build houses. And look at these solid  stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements. This is really  really useful  because building things is terrifying. It's expensive  it takes a long time  and it's very complicated. And the people that build things    developers and governments    they're naturally afraid of innovation  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to. That's how we end up with buildings like this. This is a nice building. This is the Livingston Public Library that was completed in      in my hometown  and  you know  it's got a dome and it's got this round thing  and columns  red brick  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building  children  property values and history. But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today. That same year  in       on the other side of the country  another library was completed  and it looks like this. It's in Seattle. This library is about how we consume media in a digital age. It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city  a place to gather and read and share. So how is it possible that in the same year  in the same country  two buildings  both called libraries  look so completely different  And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum. On the one side is innovation  and architects are constantly pushing  pushing for new technologies  new typologies  new solutions for the way that we live today. And we push and we push and we push until we completely alienate all of you. We wear all black  we get very depressed  you think we're adorable  we're dead inside because we've got no choice. We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love. So we do that  and you're happy  we feel like sellouts  so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last     years  and certainly for the last    years. Okay     years ago we were coming out of the '  s. Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism. It's about concrete. You can guess this. Small windows  dehumanizing scale. This is really tough stuff. So as we get closer to the '  s  we start to reengage those symbols. We push the pendulum back into the other direction. We take these forms that we know you love and we update them. We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials. And you love it. And we can't give you enough of it. We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass. Forms got big  forms got bold and colorful. Dwarves became columns. Swans grew to the size of buildings. It was crazy. But it's the '  s  it's cool. We're all hanging out in malls and we're all moving to the suburbs  and out there  out in the suburbs  we can create our own architectural fantasies. And those fantasies  they can be Mediterranean or French or Italian. Possibly with endless breadsticks. This is the thing about postmodernism. This is the thing about symbols. They're easy  they're cheap  because instead of making places  we're making memories of places. Because I know   and I know all of you know  this isn't Tuscany. This is Ohio. So architects get frustrated  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction. In the late '  s and early '  s  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism. We throw out historical symbols  we rely on new  computer aided design techniques  and we come up with new compositions  forms crashing into forms. This is academic and heady stuff  it's super unpopular  we totally alienate you. Ordinarily  the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction. And then  something amazing happened. In       this building opened. This is the Guggenheim Bilbao  by Frank Gehry. And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture. Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics  academics  and the general public were completely united around a building. The New York Times called this building a miracle. Tourism in Bilbao increased       percent after this building was completed. So all of a sudden  everybody wants one of these buildings  L.A.  Seattle  Chicago  New York  Cleveland  Springfield. Everybody wants one  and Gehry is everywhere. He is our very first starchitect. Now  how is it possible that these forms    they're wild and radical    how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world  And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism. We created an emotional reaction to these forms. So did every mayor in the world. So every mayor knew that if they had these forms  they had culture and tourism. This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened to a few other starchitects. It happened to Zaha and it happened to Libeskind  and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millennium could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture  as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information. Because think about how you consume architecture. A thousand years ago  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building. Transportation speeds up  You can take a boat  you can take a plane  you can be a tourist. Technology speeds up  You can see it in a newspaper  on TV  until finally  we are all architectural photographers  and the building has become disembodied from the site. Architecture is everywhere now  and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture. Because architecture actually moves quite quickly. It doesn't take long to think about a building. It takes a long time to build a building  three or four years  and in the interim  an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not. That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture. That's how we end up with buildings like this. Brutalism wasn't a two year movement  it was a    year movement. For    years  we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it. It's never going to happen again  I think  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete  of steel  or of the elevator  and it's a media revolution. So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum  it starts swinging faster and faster  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol  between us  the architects  and you  the public. Now we can make nearly instantaneous  emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new. Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed. We were hired to replace this building  which burned down. This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State. It's a vacation community. We proposed a building that was audacious  that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to  and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram  and we let people start to do what they do  share it  comment  like it  hate it. But that meant that two years before the building was complete  it was already a part of the community  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product  there were no surprises. This building was already a part of this community  and then that first summer  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media  because these  these are not just pictures of a building  they're your pictures of a building. And as you use them to tell your story  they become part of your personal narrative  and what you're doing is you're short circuiting all of our collective memory  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand. That means we don't need the Greeks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture. We can tell each other what we think about architecture  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings. Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston. If that building was going to be built today  the first thing they would do is go online and search  new libraries.  They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation  of innovation  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be. That's ammunition. That's ammunition that they can take with them to the mayor of Livingston  to the people of Livingston  and say  there's no one answer to what a library is today. Let's be a part of this. This abundance of experimentation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment. Everything is different now. Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings  and you aren't the hapless public  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore. Architects can hear you  and you're not intimidated by architecture. That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth from style to style  from movement to movement  is irrelevant. We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces. This is the end of architectural history  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today. It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works. It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn  not some red brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be. It means that robots are going to build our buildings  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce. And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around. It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach  Florida  can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night. It means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East River of New York  and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause  no one client anymore. It means that no building is too small for innovation  like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe. And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable  like this ugly little building in Spain  where the architects dug a hole  packed it with hay  and then poured concrete around it  and when the concrete dried  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made  and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset. Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings. It doesn't matter how we build  it matters what we build. Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier. We've just been waiting for all of you to want them. And finally  we're not on opposite sides anymore. Find an architect  hire an architect  work with us to design better buildings  better cities  and a better world  because the stakes are high. Buildings don't just reflect our society  they shape our society down to the smallest spaces  the local libraries  the homes where we raise our children  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom. Thank you. We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons  especially for young inmates. New York state is one of only two in the U.S. that automatically arrests and tries     to    year olds as adults. This culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment  and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on. There's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them. Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to     we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people. I know firsthand. Before I ever turned     I spent approximately     days on Rikers Island  and to add to that I spent almost     days in solitary confinement  and let me tell you this  Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window  it gets tiring. Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there  you start pacing back and forth in your cell  you start talking to yourself  your thoughts start running wild  and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy. Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person  not cause him or her to become more angry  frustrated  and feel more hopeless. Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people  they pretty much  reenter society with nothing. And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating. But it all starts with the C.O.s. It's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys  or vice versa for some  but it's a little more than that. See  these C.O.s are normal  everyday people. They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they  serve.  They're just normal people. They're not robots  and there's  nothing special about them. They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does. The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s. They play the little high school kid games with each other. They politic with one another. And the female C.O.s gossip to each other. So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s  and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe. One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit. He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit  and he felt  since there was a female officer working on the floor  that I violated his shift. So he punched me in my chest. He kind of knocked the wind out of me. I wasn't impulsive  I didn't react right away  because I know this is their house. I have no wins. All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately. So I just gave him a look in his eyes and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning  and he said to me   Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble  because you're looking like you want to fight.  So he commenced to taking off his utility belt  he took off his shirt and his badge  and he said   We could fight.  So I asked him   You gonna hold it down   Now  that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody  and you're not going to report it. He said   Yeah  I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down   I didn't even respond. I just punched him right in his face  and we began fighting right then and there. Towards the end of the fight  he slammed me up against the wall  so while we were tussled up  he said to me   You good   as if he got the best of me  but in my mind  I know I got the best of him  so I replied very cocky   Oh  I'm good  you good   He said   Yeah  I'm good   I'm good.  We let go  he shook my hand  said he gave me my respect  gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way. Believe it or not  you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island that'll fight you one on one. They feel that they understand how it is  and they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at. Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes  we can handle it in that manner. I walk away from it like a man  you walk away from it like a man  and that's it. Some C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you. This is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept. In some instances  we're in it together with the C.O.s. However  institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population  and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with  the mental health population as well. These C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case. So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there  Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change  so once they reenter back into society  they're doing something positive  A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming. When I was on Rikers Island  the huge thing was solitary confinement. Solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally  physically and emotionally. That's what it was designed for. The U.S. Attorney General recently released a report stating that they're going to ban solitary confinement in New York state for teens. One thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading. I tried to educate myself as much as possible. I read any and everything I could get my hands on. And aside from that  I wrote music and short stories. Some programs that I feel would benefit our young people are art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that talent  and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined  How about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music  Just a thought. When adolescents come to Rikers Island  C    RNDC is the building that they're housed in. That's nicknamed  gladiator school   because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they're tough  being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs  and everybody feels that they're tough. So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you or I'm tougher than you  you and you. But let's be honest  That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people. We need to help institutions and these teens realize that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street  that they can actually make a change. It's sad to report that while I was in prison  I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison  what type of crimes they're going to commit when they get back in the street. The conversations used to sound something like this   Oh  when I hit the street  my brother got this connection for this  that and the third   or   My man over here got this connection for the low price. Let's exchange information   and   When we hit the town  we're going to do it real big.  I used to hear these conversations and think to myself   Wow  these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes.  So I came up with a name for that  I called it a go back to jail quick scheme because really  how long is that going to last  You get a retirement plan with that  Nice little pension      k       b   You get health insurance  Dental  But I will tell you this  Being in jail and being in prison  I came across some of the most intelligent  brilliant  and talented people that I would ever meet. I've seen individuals take a potato chip bag and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame. I've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it. At the age of     I was in a maximum security prison called Elmira Correctional Facility. I just came out of the weight shack from working out  and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky. Mind you  this older gentlemen was serving a    and a third to life sentence in which he already had served    years of that sentence. So I walk up to him and I said   O.G.  what's going on  man  you good   He looked at me  and he said   Yeah  I'm good  young blood.  I'm like   So what are you looking up at the sky for  man  What's so fascinating up there   He said   You look up and you tell me what you see.   Clouds.   Laughter  He said   All right. What else do you see   At that time  it was a plane passing by. I said   All right  I see an airplane.  He said   Exactly  and what's  on that airplane    People.   Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going    I don't know. You know  Please let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers.  He said   You're missing the big picture  young blood. That plane with those people is going somewhere  while we're here stuck. The big picture is this  That plane with those people going somewhere  that's life passing us by while we behind these walls  stuck.  Ever since that day  that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change. Growing up  I was always a good  smart kid. Some people would say I was a little too smart for my own good. I had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist. Currently  I'm working at the Fortune Society  which is a reentry program  and I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism. So I connect them with the services that they need once they're released from jail and prison so they can make a positive transition back into society. If I was to see my    year old self today  I would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and I would let him know   Listen  this is me. I'm you. This is us. We are one. Everything that you're about to do  I know what you're gonna do before you do it because I already did it  and I would encourage him not to hang out with x  y and z people. I would tell him not to be in such and such place. I would tell him  keep your behind in school  man  because that's where you need to be  because that's what's going to get you somewhere in life. This is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women. We shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to escape. Thank you. Hello. I'm a toy developer. With a dream of creating new toys that have never been seen before  I began working at a toy company nine years ago. When I first started working there  I proposed many new ideas to my boss every day. However  my boss always asked if I had the data to prove it would sell  and asked me to think of product development after analyzing market data. Data  data  data. So I analyzed the market data before thinking of a product. However  I was unable to think of anything new at that moment. My ideas were unoriginal. I wasn't getting any new ideas and I grew tired of thinking. It was so hard that I became this skinny. It's true.  Applause  You've all probably had similar experiences and felt this way too. Your boss was being difficult. The data was difficult. You become sick of thinking. Now  I throw out the data. It's my dream to create new toys. And now  instead of data  I'm using a game called Shiritori to come up with new ideas. I would like to introduce this method today. What is Shiritori  Take apple  elephant  and trumpet  for example. It's a game where  you take turns saying words that start with the last letter of the previous word. It's the same in Japanese and English. You can play Shiritori as you like   neko  kora  raibu  burashi   etc  etc.  Cat  cola  concert  brush  Many random words will come out. You force those words to connect to what you want to think of and form ideas. In my case  for example  since I want to think of toys  what could a toy cat be  A cat that lands after doing a somersault from a high place  How about a toy with cola  A toy gun where you shoot cola and get someone soaking wet  Ridiculous ideas are okay. The key is to keep them flowing. The more ideas you produce  you're sure to come up with some good ones  too. A brush  for example. Can we make a toothbrush into a toy  We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and    you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth. Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it. Can we make a hat into a toy  How about something like a roulette game  where you try the hat on one by one  and then  when someone puts it on  a scary alien breaks through the top screaming   Ahh   I wonder if there would be a demand for this at parties  Ideas that didn't come out while you stare at the data will start to come out. Actually  this bubble wrap  which is used to pack fragile objects  combined with a toy  made Mugen Pop Pop  a toy where you can pop the bubbles as much as you like. It was a big hit when it reached stores. Data had nothing to do with its success. Although it's only popping bubbles  it's a great way to kill time  so please pass this around amongst yourselves today and play with it. Anyway  you continue to come up with useless ideas. Think up many trivial ideas  everyone. If you base your ideas on data analysis and know what you're aiming for  you'll end up trying too hard  and you can't produce new ideas. Even if you know what your aim is  think of ideas as freely as if you were throwing darts with your eyes closed. If you do this  you surely will hit somewhere near the center. At least one will. That's the one you should choose. If you do so  that idea will be in demand and  moreover  it will be brand new. That is how I think of new ideas. It doesn't have to be Shiritori  there are many different methods. You just have to choose words at random. You can flip through a dictionary and choose words at random. For example  you could look up two random letters and gather the results or go to the store and connect product names with what you want to think of. The point is to gather random words  not information from the category you're thinking for. If you do this  the ingredients for the association of ideas are collected and form connections that will produce many ideas. The greatest advantage to this method is the continuous flow of images. Because you're thinking of one word after another  the image of the previous word is still with you. That image will automatically be related with future words. Unconsciously  a concert will be connected to a brush and a roulette game will be connected to a hat. You wouldn't even realize it. You can come up with ideas that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This method is  of course  not just for toys. You can collect ideas for books  apps  events  and many other projects. I hope you all try this method. There are futures that are born from data. However  using this silly game called Shiritori  I look forward to the exciting future you will create  a future you couldn't even imagine. Thank you very much. I have a confession to make. I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead. But recently  I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation. I'm an ethnographer. I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested. So along with three co conspirators  I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation. We studied    men and women  located in seven countries across the globe  working in    different industries. In total  we spent hundreds of hours on the ground  on site  watching these leaders in action. We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did. The bottom line  If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership. Leading innovation is not about creating a vision  and inspiring others to execute it. But what do we mean by innovation  An innovation is anything that is both new and useful. It can be a product or service. It can be a process or a way of organizing. It can be incremental  or it can be breakthrough. We have a pretty inclusive definition. How many of you recognize this man  Put your hands up. Keep your hands up  if you know who this is. How about these familiar faces  From your show of hands  it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie  but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull  the founder and CEO of Pixar    one of the companies I had the privilege of studying. My first visit to Pixar was in       when they were working on  Ratatouille   that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef. Computer generated movies are really mainstream today  but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly    years to create the first full length C.G. movie. In the    years hence  they've produced    movies. I was recently at Pixar  and I'm here to tell you that number    is sure to be a winner. When many of us think about innovation  though  we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha ' moment. But we all know that's a myth. Innovation is not about solo genius  it's about collective genius. Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie  No solo genius  no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies. On the contrary  it takes about     people four to five years  to make one of those movies. To help us understand the process  an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture. He did so reluctantly  because it suggested that the process  was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups. Even with all those arrows  he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative  interrelated and  frankly  messy their process was. Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar  the story evolves. So think about it. Some shots go through quickly. They don't all go through in order. It depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene. So if you think about that scene in  Up  where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird  that    seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect. The other thing about a Pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps. Partway through one production  an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side. When the director saw that drawing  he thought it was great. It was beautiful  but he said   You've got to lose it  it doesn't fit the character.  Two weeks later  the director came back and said   Let's put in those few seconds of film.  Because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius  he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story. What we know is  at the heart of innovation is a paradox. You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful. Innovation is a journey. It's a type of collaborative problem solving  usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view. Innovations rarely get created full blown. As many of you know  they're the result  usually  of trial and error. Lots of false starts  missteps and mistakes. Innovative work can be very exhilarating  but it also can be really downright scary. So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does  we have to ask ourselves  what's going on here  For sure  history and certainly Hollywood  is full of star studded teams that have failed. Most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks  if you will  in the kitchen. So why is it that Pixar  with all of its cooks  is able to be so successful time and time again  When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai  or a luxury brand in Korea  or a social enterprise in Africa  we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities  creative abrasion  creative agility and creative resolution. Creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse. In innovative organizations  they amplify differences  they don't minimize them. Creative abrasion is not about brainstorming  where people suspend their judgment. No  they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives. Individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire  they learn how to actively listen  but guess what  They also learn how to advocate for their point of view. They understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict. Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit  reflection and adjustment. It's about discovery driven learning where you act  as opposed to plan  your way to the future. It's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process. It's about running a series of experiments  and not a series of pilots. Experiments are usually about learning. When you get a negative outcome  you're still really learning something that you need to know. Pilots are often about being right. When they don't work  someone or something is to blame. The final capability is creative resolution. This is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful. When you look at innovative organizations  they never go along to get along. They don't compromise. They don't let one group or one individual dominate  even if it's the boss  even if it's the expert. Instead  they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both and solutions to arise and not simply either or solutions. These three capabilities are why we see that Pixar is able to do what it does. Let me give you another example  and that example is the infrastructure group of Google. The infrastructure group of Google is the group that has to keep the website up and running     . So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube  they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate. The head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named Bill Coughran. Bill and his leadership team  who he referred to as his brain trust  had to figure out what to do about this situation. They thought about it for a while. Instead of creating a group to tackle this task  they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously around different alternatives. Two groups coalesced. One became known as Big Table  the other became known as Build It From Scratch. Big Table proposed that they build on the current system. Build It From Scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system. Separately  these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach. In engineering reviews  Bill described his role as   Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate.  Early on  the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could  bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach.  When Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night if something went wrong with the website  they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design. As the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data  or the evidence  began to come in  it became pretty clear that the Big Table solution was the right one for the moment. So they selected that one. But to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From Scratch team  Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system. This whole process took nearly two years  but I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed. Early in that process  one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said   We're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments.  But as the process unfolded  he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions. He admitted   If you had forced us to all be on one team  we might have focused on proving who was right  and winning  and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google.  Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again  It's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that. They know how to do collaborative problem solving  they know how to do discovery driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making. Some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now   We don't know how to do those things in my organization. So why do they know how to do those things at Pixar  and why do they know how to do those things at Google   When many of the people that worked for Bill told us  in their opinion  that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley  we completely agreed  the man is a genius. Leadership is the secret sauce. But it's a different kind of leadership  not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership. One of the leaders I met with early on said to me   Linda  I don't read books on leadership. All they do is make me feel bad.   Laughter   In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision. But if I'm trying to do something that's truly new  I have no answers. I don't know what direction we're going in and I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there.  For sure  there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed. But if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about. Leading innovation is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving. At this point  some of you may be wondering   What does that leadership really look like   At Pixar  they understand that innovation takes a village. The leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities. How do they define leadership  They say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong. What kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar  A world where you're living at the frontier. What do they focus their time on  Not on creating a vision. Instead they spend their time thinking about   How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square so that people will interact  Let's put in a policy that anyone  no matter what their level or role  is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film. What can we do to make sure that all the disruptors  all the minority voices in this organization  speak up and are heard  And  finally  let's bestow credit in a very generous way.  I don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie  but the babies born during a production are listed there. How did Bill think about what his role was  Bill said   I lead a volunteer organization. Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere. They want to cocreate with me the future. My job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate into chaos.  How did he see his role   I'm a role model  I'm a human glue  I'm a connector  I'm an aggregator of viewpoints. I'm never a dictator of viewpoints.  Advice about how you exercise the role  Hire people who argue with you. And  guess what  Sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague. Some of you may be wondering now  what are these people thinking  They're thinking   I'm not the visionary  I'm the social architect. I'm creating the space where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions.  If some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar  or you don't work at a Google  I want to tell you there's still hope. We've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens. We studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers     competitors  to collaborate and innovate. We studied the head of marketing at a German automaker where  fundamentally  they believed that it was the design engineers  not the marketeers  who were allowed to be innovative. We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies  an Indian outsourcing company. When we met Vineet  his company was about  in his words  to become irrelevant. We watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation. At HCL technologies  like at many companies  the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it. What he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do. Because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom up innovation we saw at Pixar or Google. So they began to work on that. They stopped giving answers  they stopped trying to provide solutions. Instead  what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid  the young sparks  the people who were closest to the customers  as the source of innovation. They began to transfer the organization's growth to that level. In Vineet's language  this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few  and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that was happening every day. For sure  Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries. For sure  they understood that that was not their role. So I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed. Because Ed  like Vineet  understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage  not perform on it. If we want to invent a better future  and I suspect that's why many of us are here  then we need to reimagine our task. Our task is to create the space where everybody's slices of genius can be unleashed and harnessed  and turned into works of collective genius. Thank you. I cannot forget them. Their names were Aslan  Alik  Andrei  Fernanda  Fred  Galina  Gunnhild  Hans  Ingeborg  Matti  Natalya  Nancy  Sheryl  Usman  Zarema  and the list is longer. For many  their existence  their humanity  has been reduced to statistics  coldly recorded as  security incidents.  For me  they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '  s. They were nurses  logisticians  shelter experts  paralegals  interpreters. And for this service  they were murdered  their families torn apart  and their story largely forgotten. No one was ever sentenced for these crimes. I cannot forget them. They live in me somehow  their memories giving me meaning every day. But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind. As humanitarian aid workers  they made the choice to be at the side of the victim  to provide some assistance  some comfort  some protection  but when they needed protection themselves  it wasn't there. When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria    aid worker abducted  hostage executed    but who were they  Why were they there  What motivated them  How did we become so indifferent to these crimes  This is why I am here today with you. We need to find better ways to remember them. We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives. We also need to demand justice. When in '   I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus  I knew some of the risks. Five colleagues had been killed  three had been seriously injured  seven had already been taken hostage. So we were careful. We were using armored  vehicles  decoy cars  changing patterns of travel  changing homes  all sorts of security measures. Yet on a cold winter night of January '    it was my turn. When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard  we were surrounded by armed men. They took the guard  they put him on the floor  they beat him up in front of me  tied him  dragged him away. I was handcuffed  blindfolded  and forced to kneel  as the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck. When it happens to you  there is no time for thinking  no time for praying. My brain went on automatic  rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind. It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me  but that someone  somewhere  had ordered my kidnapping. Then a process of dehumanization started that day. I was no more than just a commodity. I normally don't talk about this  but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those     days of captivity. I was kept in an underground cellar  total darkness  for    hours and    minutes every day  and then the guards  would come  normally two. They would bring a big piece of bread  a bowl of soup  and a candle. That candle would burn for    minutes     minutes of precious light  and then they would take it away  and I returned to darkness. I was chained by a metal cable to my bed. I could do only four small steps. I always dreamt of the fifth one. And no TV  no radio  no newspaper  no one to talk to. I had no towel  no soap  no toilet paper  just two metal buckets open  one for water  for one waste. Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk  We are breaking my nerves very slowly. Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe. How do you describe nothing  There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached in that very thin border between sanity and madness. In the darkness  sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers. I would start with the black  play with the white  back to the black trying to trick the other side. I don't play checkers anymore. I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague  the guard  Edik. I didn't know what had happened to him. I was trying not to think  I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot. I tried to pray  I tried all sorts of memorization games. But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal. One part of your brain wants you to resist  to shout  to cry  and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it. It's a constant internal debate  there is no one to arbitrate. Once a guard came to me  very aggressively  and he told me   Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food.  I wasn't in a good mood  so I insulted him. I insulted his mother  I insulted his ancestors. The consequence was moderate  he threw the food into my waste. The day after he came back with the same demand. He got the same answer  which had the same consequence. Four days later  the body was full of pain. I didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little. So when the guards came down  I knelt. I begged for my food. Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle. After my kidnapping  I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya  three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars  and upon arrival  I was interrogated for    days by a guy called Ruslan. The routine was always the same  a bit more light     minutes. He would come down to the cellar  he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair  and he would turn on the music loud. And then he would yell questions. He would scream. He would beat me. I'll spare you the details. There are many questions I could not understand  and there are some questions I did not want to understand. The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape     songs     minutes. I would always long for the last song. On one day  one night in that cellar  I don't know what it was  I heard a child crying above my head  a boy  maybe two or three years old. Footsteps  confusion  people running. So when Ruslan came the day after  before he put the first question to me  I asked him   How is your son today  Is he feeling better   Ruslan was taken by surprise. He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life. I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better. And we talked about education  we talked about families. He talked to me about his children. I talked to him about my daughters. And then he'd talk about guns  about cars  about women  and I had to talk about guns  about cars  about women. And we talked until the last song on the tape. Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met. He did not touch me anymore. He did not ask any other questions. I was no longer just a commodity. Two days after  I was transferred to another place. There  a guard came to me  very close    it was quite unusual    and he said with a very soft voice  he said   I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan.  What could I possibly reply  It was so painful. It was like a blade in the belly. It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became. He was young  he was shy. I never saw his face. He probably meant well. But in those    seconds  he made me question everything we did  all the sacrifices. He made me think also how they see us. Until then  I had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing. One cannot assume this. Well  explaining why we do this is not that easy  even to our closest relatives. We are not perfect  we are not superior  we are not the world's fire brigade  we are not superheroes  we don't stop wars  we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution. Yet we do this because one life matters. Sometimes that's the only difference you make    one individual  one family  a small group of individuals    and it matters. When you have a tsunami  an earthquake or a typhoon  you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world  searching for survivors for weeks. Why  Nobody questions this. Every life matters  or every life should matter. This is the same for us when we help refugees  people displaced within their country by conflict  or stateless persons  I know many people  when they are confronted by overwhelming suffering  they feel powerless and they stop there. It's a pity  because there are so many ways people can help. We don't stop with that feeling. We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance  some protection  some comfort. We have to. We can't do otherwise. It's what makes us feel  I don't know  simply human. That's a picture of me the day of my release. Months after my release  I met the then French prime minister. The second thing he told me   You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus. You don't know how many problems you've created for us.  It was a short meeting. I think helping people in danger is responsible. In that war  that nobody seriously wanted to stop  and we have many of these today  bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity  it was making a real difference for the people. Why could he not understand this  We have a responsibility to try. You've heard about that concept  Responsibility to Protect. Outcomes may depend on various parameters. We may even fail  but there is worse than failing    it's not even trying when we can. Well  if you are met this way  if you sign up for this sort of job  your life is going to be full of joy and sadness  because there are a lot of people we cannot help  a lot of people we cannot protect  a lot of people we did not save. I call them my ghost  and by having witnessed their suffering from close  you take a bit  of that suffering on yourself. Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness. They are thrown into situations where they are witness  but they are powerless to bring any change. They have to learn to accept it and gradually turn this into positive energy. It's difficult. Many don't succeed  but for those who do  there is no other job like this. You can see the difference you make every day. Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or  in post conflict environments  yet our life  our job  is becoming  increasingly life threatening  and the sanctity of our life is fading. Do you know that since the millennium  the number of attacks on humanitarian  aid workers has tripled       broke new records      colleagues killed      seriously wounded      abducted. So many broken lives. Until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '  s  humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages  but by and large we were not the target of these attacks. This has changed. Look at this picture. Baghdad  August          colleagues were killed. Gone are the days when a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross would automatically protect us. Criminal groups and some political groups have cross fertilized over the last    years  and they've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating. Humanitarian principles are tested  questioned  and often ignored  but perhaps more importantly  we have abandoned the search for justice. There seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian aid workers. After my release  I was told not to seek any form of justice. It won't do you any good  that's what I was told. Plus  you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues. It took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated  with my kidnapping  but this was the exception. There was no justice for any  of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between '   and '    and it's the same all over the world. This is unacceptable. This is inexcusable. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law. Those crimes should not go unpunished. We must end this cycle of impunity. We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself. That makes me furious. I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for. I don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed. I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me. I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country. I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages. Four days before my eventful release  four hostages were beheaded a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity. Why them  Why am I here today  No easy answer. I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives  from colleagues  from friends  from people I didn't know. They have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness. Not everyone was treated with the same attention. How many of my colleagues  after a traumatic incident  took their own life  I can count nine that I knew personally. How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse  I've lost that count. There is a price for this type of life. In Russia  all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top. It says   In Russian   No one is forgotten  nothing is forgotten.  I do not forget my lost colleagues. I cannot forget anything. I call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected. We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off. After my ordeal  a lot of colleagues asked me   But why do you continue  Why do you do this sort of job  Why do you have to go back to it   My answer was very simple  If I had quit  that would have meant my kidnapper had won. They would have taken my soul and my humanity. Thank you. How many people here have heard of PMS  Everybody  right  Everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period  that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and irritability. There's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this. Well  I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true. I'm here to give you  the good news about PMS. But first  let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS is entrenched in American culture. If you examine newspaper or magazine articles  you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS. In an article in the magazine Redbook titled  You  PMS Free   readers were informed that between     to    percent of women suffer from PMS. L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers that    to    percent of women suffer from PMS  and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health  and a couple of years ago  even the Wall Street Journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS  asking its female readers   Do you turn into a witch every month   From all these articles  you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of PMS. However  after five decades of research  there's no strong consensus on the definition  the cause  the treatment  or even  the existence of PMS. As most commonly defined by psychologists  PMS involves negative behavioral  cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation. But here's where it gets tricky. Over     different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS  and here are just a few of those. Now  I want to be clear here. I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms. What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn't amount to a mental disorder  and when psychologists come up with a disorder that's so vaguely defined  the label eventually becomes meaningless. With a list of symptoms this long and wide  I could have PMS  you could have PMS  the guy in the third row here could have PMS  my dog could have PMS.  Laughter  Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms. Some said three. Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you  but others said minor symptoms were just as important. For many years  because there was no standardization in the definition of PMS  when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates  their estimates ranged from five percent of women to    percent of women  so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS. Overall  the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable. First  many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively  looking to the past and relying on memory  which is known to inflate reporting of PMS compared to what's called prospective reporting  which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row. Many studies also exclusively focused on white  middle class women  which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women. We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations. Third  many studies failed to use control groups. If we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have PMS  we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS. And finally  many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose PMS  focusing on different symptoms  symptom duration and severity. To do reliable research on any condition  scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they're all talking about the same thing  and with PMS  this has not been the case. However  in       the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  known as the DSM  thankfully    it's also the manual for mental health professionals    they redefined PMS as PMDD  Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease. And according to these new DSM guidelines  in most menstrual cycles in the last year  at least five of    possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts  the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun  and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended. One of these symptoms must come from this list of four  marked mood swings  irritability  anxiety  or depression. The other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide  including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite. The DSM also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress    there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships    and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row. And finally  the DSM required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder. So scientifically speaking  this is an improvement. We now have a limited number of symptoms  and a high impact on functioning that's required  and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific. Well  using this criteria and looking at most recent studies  we see that on average  three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD. Not all women  not most women  not the majority of women  not even a lot of women  three to eight percent. For everyone else  variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month  and this is the information the scientific community has had since the     s. In       my colleagues and I published an article describing the PMS and PMDD research  and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals. The questions is  why hasn't this information trickled down to the public  Why do these myths persist  Well  certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive from books  TV  movies  the Internet  that everyone gets PMS go a long way in convincing them it must be true. Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS  the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it. Let me tell you what I mean by  erroneously.  You might ask her   Do you have PMS   and she says yes  but then  when you have her  keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months  no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month. Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role. Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of PMS allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike. The near universal definition of a good woman is one who is happy  loving  caring for others  and taking great satisfaction from that role. Well  PMS has become a permission slip to be angry  complain  be irritated  without losing the title of good woman. We know that the variables in a woman's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones  but when she attributes anger to hormones  she's absolved of responsibility or criticism.  Oh  that's not who she is. It's out of her control.  And while this can be a useful tool  it serves to invalidate women's emotions. When people respond to a woman's anger with the thought   Oh  it's just that time of the month   her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited. So who else benefits from the myth of PMS  Well  I can tell you that treating PMS has become a profitable   thriving industry. Amazon.com currently offers over       books on PMS treatment. A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics  workshops and seminars. Reputable Internet sources of medical information like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder. It's not a known disorder  but they list it. And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it  like anti depressants or hormones. Interestingly  though  both websites say that the success of medication in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman. Well  that doesn't make sense. If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause  which PMS is supposed to be  then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women. This has not been the case with these treatments  and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective  a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement. So we have not had that at all with these so called treatments. However  the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that PMS is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial. When women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones  medical protocol requires that they have physician follow up every three months. That's a lot of doctor visits. Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their child bearing lives. Over the counter drugs like Midol even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability  even though they only contain a diuretic  a pain reliever and caffeine. Now  far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine  but I don't think reducing tension is one of them. Since       Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents. They are aiming at young girls early  to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster  but wait  there's something you can do about it  Take Midol and you will be a human being again. In       Midol took in    million dollars in sales revenue. So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some  it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women. First  it contributes to the medicalization of women's reproductive health. The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment  and this has come at many costs  including excessive Cesarean deliveries  hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health. Second  the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women as irrational and overemotional. When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts  it becomes easy to question  the competence of all women. Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce  but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business  and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator  someone who has qualities like  rationality  steadiness  competence come to mind  and in our culture  that sounds more like a man than a woman  and the PMS myth contributes to that. Psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different. One study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different. And finally  the PMS myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset. Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood. Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions  but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them. So the good news about PMS is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle  the great majority don't get a mental disorder. They go to work or school  take care of their families  and function at a normal level. We know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different  so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day. Thank you. We are built out of very small stuff  and we are embedded in a very large cosmos  and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales  and that's because our brains haven't evolved to understand  the world at that scale. Instead  we're trapped on this very thin slice of perception right in the middle. But it gets strange  because even at  that slice of reality that we call home  we're not seeing most of the action that's going on. So take the colors of our world. This is light waves  electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and it hits specialized receptors in the back of our eyes. But we're not seeing all the waves out there. In fact  what we see is less than a    trillionth of what's out there. So you have radio waves and microwaves and X rays and gamma rays passing through your body right now and you're completely unaware of it  because you don't come with the proper biological receptors for picking it up. There are thousands of cell phone conversations passing through you right now  and you're utterly blind to it. Now  it's not that these things are inherently unseeable. Snakes include some infrared in their reality  and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world  and of course we build machines in the dashboards of our cars to pick up on signals in the radio frequency range  and we built machines in hospitals to pick up on the X ray range. But you can't sense any of those by yourself  at least not yet  because you don't come equipped with the proper sensors. Now  what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology  and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there. Instead  our brains are sampling just a little bit of the world. Now  across the animal kingdom  different animals pick up on different parts of reality. So in the blind and deaf world of the tick  the important signals are temperature and butyric acid  in the world of the black ghost knifefish  its sensory world is lavishly colored by electrical fields  and for the echolocating bat  its reality is constructed out of air compression waves. That's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on  and we have a word for this in science. It's called the umwelt  which is the German word for the surrounding world. Now  presumably  every animal assumes that its umwelt is the entire objective reality out there  because why would you ever stop to imagine that there's something beyond what we can sense. Instead  what we all do is we accept reality as it's presented to us. Let's do a consciousness raiser on this. Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog. Your whole world is about smelling. You've got a long snout that has     million scent receptors in it  and you have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules  and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air. Everything is about smell for you. So one day  you stop in your tracks with a revelation. You look at your human owner and you think   What is it like to have the pitiful  impoverished nose of a human  What is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air  How can you not know that there's a cat     yards away  or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago   So because we're humans  we've never experienced that world of smell  so we don't miss it  because we are firmly settled into our umwelt. But the question is  do we have to be stuck there  So as a neuroscientist  I'm interested in the way that technology might expand our umwelt  and how that's going to change the experience of being human. So we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology  because there are hundreds of thousands of people walking around with artificial hearing and artificial vision. So the way this works is  you take a microphone and you digitize the signal  and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear. Or  with the retinal implant  you take a camera and you digitize the signal  and then you plug an electrode grid directly into the optic nerve. And as recently as    years ago  there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn't work. Why  It's because these technologies speak the language of Silicon Valley  and it's not exactly the same dialect as our natural biological sense organs. But the fact is that it works  the brain figures out how to use the signals just fine. Now  how do we understand that  Well  here's the big secret  Your brain is not hearing or seeing any of this. Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull. All it ever sees are electrochemical signals that come in along different data cables  and this is all it has to work with  and nothing more. Now  amazingly  the brain is really good at taking in these signals and extracting patterns and assigning meaning  so that it takes this inner cosmos and puts together a story of this  your subjective world. But here's the key point  Your brain doesn't know  and it doesn't care  where it gets the data from. Whatever information comes in  it just figures out what to do with it. And this is a very efficient kind of machine. It's essentially a general purpose computing device  and it just takes in everything and figures out what it's going to do with it  and that  I think  frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels. So I call this the P.H.  model of evolution  and I don't want to get too technical here  but P.H. stands for Potato Head  and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love  like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips  these are merely peripheral plug and play devices  You stick them in  and you're good to go. The brain figures out what to do with the data that comes in. And when you look across the animal kingdom  you find lots of peripheral devices. So snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared  and the ghost knifefish has electroreceptors  and the star nosed mole has this appendage with    fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a  D model of the world  and many birds have magnetite so they can orient to the magnetic field of the planet. So what this means is that nature doesn't have to continually redesign the brain. Instead  with the principles of brain operation established  all nature has to worry about is designing new peripherals. Okay. So what this means is this  The lesson that surfaces is that there's nothing really special or fundamental about the biology that we come to the table with. It's just what we have inherited from a complex road of evolution. But it's not what we have to stick with  and our best proof of principle of this comes from what's called sensory substitution. And that refers to feeding information into the brain via unusual sensory channels  and the brain just figures out what to do with it. Now  that might sound speculative  but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal Nature in     . So a scientist named Paul Bach y Rita put blind people in a modified dental chair  and he set up a video feed  and he put something in front of the camera  and then you would feel that poked into your back with a grid of solenoids. So if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera  you're feeling that in your back  and amazingly  blind people got pretty good at being able to determine what was in front of the camera just by feeling it in the small of their back. Now  there have been many modern incarnations of this. The sonic glasses take a video feed right in front of you and turn that into a sonic landscape  so as things move around  and get closer and farther  it sounds like  Bzz  bzz  bzz.  It sounds like a cacophony  but after several weeks  blind people start getting pretty good at understanding what's in front of them just based on what they're hearing. And it doesn't have to be through the ears  this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead  so whatever's in front of the video feed  you're feeling it on your forehead. Why the forehead  Because you're not using it for much else. The most modern incarnation is called the brainport  and this is a little electrogrid that sits on your tongue  and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals  and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket  or they can navigate complex obstacle courses. They can come to see through their tongue. Now  that sounds completely insane  right  But remember  all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain. Your brain doesn't know where the signals come from. It just figures out what to do with them. So my interest in my lab is sensory substitution for the deaf  and this is a project I've undertaken with a graduate student in my lab  Scott Novich  who is spearheading this for his thesis. And here is what we wanted to do  we wanted to make it so that sound from the world gets converted in some way so that a deaf person can understand what is being said. And we wanted to do this  given the power and ubiquity of portable computing  we wanted to make sure that this would run on cell phones and tablets  and also we wanted to make this a wearable  something that you could wear under your clothing. So here's the concept. So as I'm speaking  my sound is getting captured by the tablet  and then it's getting mapped onto a vest that's covered in vibratory motors  just like the motors in your cell phone. So as I'm speaking  the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest. Now  this is not just conceptual  this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth  and I'm wearing the vest right now. So as I'm speaking     Applause     the sound is getting translated into dynamic patterns of vibration. I'm feeling the sonic world around me. So  we've been testing this with deaf people now  and it turns out that after just a little bit of time  people can start feeling  they can start understanding the language of the vest. So this is Jonathan. He's    years old. He has a master's degree. He was born profoundly deaf  which means that there's a part of his umwelt that's unavailable to him. So we had Jonathan train with the vest for four days  two hours a day  and here he is on the fifth day. Scott Novich  You. David Eagleman  So Scott says a word  Jonathan feels it on the vest  and he writes it on the board. SN  Where. Where. DE  Jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what's being said. SN  Touch. Touch. DE  Now  he's not doing this    Jonathan is not doing this consciously  because the patterns are too complicated  but his brain is starting to unlock the pattern that allows it to figure out what the data mean  and our expectation is that  after wearing this for about three months  he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing in the same way that when a blind person passes a finger over braille  the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all. Now  this technology has the potential to be a game changer  because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant  and that requires an invasive surgery. And this can be built for    times cheaper than a cochlear implant  which opens up this technology globally  even for the poorest countries. Now  we've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution  but what we've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition. How could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense  to expand the human umvelt  For example  could we feed real time data from the Internet directly into somebody's brain  and can they develop a direct perceptual experience  So here's an experiment we're doing in the lab. A subject is feeling a real time streaming feed from the Net of data for five seconds. Then  two buttons appear  and he has to make a choice. He doesn't know what's going on. He makes a choice  and he gets feedback after one second. Now  here's the thing  The subject has no idea what all the patterns mean  but we're seeing if he gets better at figuring out which button to press. He doesn't know that what we're feeding is real time data from the stock market  and he's making buy and sell decisions. And the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not. And what we're seeing is  can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have  after several weeks  a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet. So we'll report on that later to see how well this goes. Here's another thing we're doing  During the talks this morning  we've been automatically scraping Twitter for the TED     hashtag  and we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis  which means  are people using positive words or negative words or neutral  And while this has been going on  I have been feeling this  and so I am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time  and that's a new kind of human experience  because now I can know how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this. It's a bigger experience than a human can normally have. We're also expanding the umvelt of pilots. So in this case  the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter  so pitch and yaw and roll and orientation and heading  and that improves this pilot's ability to fly it. It's essentially like he's extending his skin up there  far away. And that's just the beginning. What we're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges and instead of trying to read the whole thing  you feel it. We live in a world of information now  and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it. So I think there's really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion. Just imagine an astronaut being able to feel the overall health of the International Space Station  or  for that matter  having you feel the invisible states of your own health  like your blood sugar and the state of your microbiome  or having     degree vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet. So the key is this  As we move into the future  we're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices. We no longer have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts on her timescales  but instead  like any good parent  she's given us the tools that we need to go out and define our own trajectory. So the question now is  how do you want to go out and experience your universe  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Can you feel it  DE  Yeah. Actually  this was the first time I felt applause on the vest. It's nice. It's like a massage.  Laughter  CA  Twitter's going crazy. Twitter's going mad. So that stock market experiment. This could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore  right  if successful  DE  Well  that's right  I wouldn't have to write to NIH anymore. CA  Well look  just to be skeptical for a minute  I mean  this is amazing  but isn't most of the evidence so far that sensory substitution works  not necessarily  that sensory addition works  I mean  isn't it possible that the blind person can see through their tongue because the visual cortex is still there  ready to process  and that that is needed as part of it  DE  That's a great question. We actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in. The general story  though  is that it's extraordinarily flexible. So when a person goes blind  what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken over by other things  by touch  by hearing  by vocabulary. So what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one trick pony. It just runs certain kinds of computations on things. And when we look around at things like braille  for example  people are getting information through bumps on their fingers. So I don't think we have any reason to think there's a theoretical limit that we know the edge of. CA  If this checks out  you're going to be deluged. There are so many possible applications for this. Are you ready for this  What are you most excited about  the direction it might go  DE  I mean  I think there's a lot of applications here. In terms of beyond sensory substitution  the things I started mentioning about astronauts on the space station  they spend a lot of their time monitoring things  and they could instead just get what's going on  because what this is really good for is multidimensional data. The key is this  Our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges  but they're really bad at what our world has become  which is screens with lots and lots of data. We have to crawl that with our attentional systems. So this is a way of just feeling the state of something  just like the way you know the state of your body as you're standing around. So I think heavy machinery  safety  feeling the state of a factory  of your equipment  that's one place it'll go right away. CA  David Eagleman  that was one mind blowing talk. Thank you very much. DE  Thank you  Chris.  Applause  I'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we've been working on for over two years  and it's in the area of additive manufacturing  also known as  D printing. You see this object here. It looks fairly simple  but it's quite complex at the same time. It's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one. In its context  it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques. It has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it. You can't even manufacture it through milling. This is a job for a  D printer  but most  D printers would take between three and    hours to fabricate it  and we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this    minute talk. Wish us luck. Now   D printing is actually a misnomer. It's actually  D printing over and over again  and it in fact uses the technologies associated with  D printing. Think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters  and then do that over and over again to build up a three dimensional object. In microelectronics  they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing  to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times. These are all  D printing technologies. Now  I'm a chemist  a material scientist too  and my co inventors are also material scientists  one a chemist  one a physicist  and we began to be interested in  D printing. And very often  as you know  new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities  and that's our story. Now  we were inspired by the  Terminator    scene for T       and we thought  why couldn't a  D printer operate in this fashion  where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object  Okay  just like the movies. And could we be inspired by Hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work  And that was our challenge. And our approach would be  if we could do this  then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back  D printing from being a manufacturing process. One   D printing takes forever. There are mushrooms that grow faster than  D printed parts.  Laughter  The layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties  and if we could grow continuously  we could eliminate those defects. And in fact  if we could grow really fast  we could also start using materials that are self curing  and we could have amazing properties. So if we could pull this off  imitate Hollywood  we could in fact address  D manufacturing. Our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously. Light and oxygen work in different ways. Light can take a resin and convert it to a solid  can convert a liquid to a solid. Oxygen inhibits that process. So light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view  and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen  we could control this process. And we refer to this as CLIP.  Continuous Liquid Interface Production.  It has three functional components. One  it has a reservoir that holds the puddle  just like the T     . At the bottom of the reservoir is a special window. I'll come back to that. In addition  it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid. The third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir  illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region. Now  the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir  it's a composite  it's a very special window. It's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen. It's got characteristics like a contact lens. So we can see how the process works. You can start to see that as you lower a stage in there  in a traditional process  with an oxygen impermeable window  you make a two dimensional pattern and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window  and so in order to introduce the next layer  you have to separate it  introduce new resin  reposition it  and do this process over and over again. But with our very special window  what we're able to do is  with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it  that oxygen inhibits the reaction  and we form a dead zone. This dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick  so that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell  right at the window interface that remains a liquid  and we pull this object up  and as we talked about in a Science paper  as we change the oxygen content  we can change the dead zone thickness. And so we have a number of key variables that we control  oxygen content  the light  the light intensity  the dose to cure  the viscosity  the geometry  and we use very sophisticated software to control this process. The result is pretty staggering. It's    to     times faster than traditional  D printers  which is game changing. In addition  as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface  we can go       times faster I believe  and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat  and as a chemical engineer  I get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have water cooled  D printers  because they're going so fast. In addition  because we're growing things  we eliminate the layers  and the parts are monolithic. You don't see the surface structure. You have molecularly smooth surfaces. And the mechanical properties of most parts made in a  D printer are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it  because of the layer like structure. But when you grow objects like this  the properties are invariant with the print direction. These look like injection molded parts  which is very different than traditional  D manufacturing. In addition  we're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this  and we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a  D printed object. There it is. That's great. You always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage  right  But we can have materials with great mechanical properties. For the first time  we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening. Think about vibration control or great sneakers  for example. We can make materials that have incredible strength  high strength to weight ratio  really strong materials  really great elastomers  so throw that in the audience there. So great material properties. And so the opportunity now  if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part  and you do it in game changing speeds  you can actually transform manufacturing. Right now  in manufacturing  what happens is  the so called digital thread in digital manufacturing. We go from a CAD drawing  a design  to a prototype to manufacturing. Often  the digital thread is broken right at prototype  because you can't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don't have the properties to be a final part. We now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing  and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things  from better fuel efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength to weight ratio  new turbine blades  all sorts of wonderful things. Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation  instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes  having a stent that's designed for you  for your own anatomy with your own tributaries  printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after    months  really game changing. Or digital dentistry  and making these kinds of structures even while you're in the dentist chair. And look at the structures that my students are making at the University of North Carolina. These are amazing microscale structures. You know  the world is really good at nano fabrication. Moore's Law has driven things from    microns and below. We're really good at that  but it's actually very hard to make things from    microns to       microns  the mesoscale. And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can't do that very well. They can't etch wafers that well. But this process is so gentle  we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing and make amazing things in tens of seconds  opening up new sensor technologies  new drug delivery techniques  new lab on a chip applications  really game changing stuff. So the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up  D manufacturing  and for us  this is very exciting  because this really is owning the intersection between hardware  software and molecular science  and I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool. Thanks for listening. You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade. Obviously  that's changed  but only recently. It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk at the Forbes    Under    summit        brilliant people  all under the age of   . That meant that in       the oldest among the group were only     and the youngest  just four. I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs. Yes  I'm in rap songs. Almost    rap songs.  Laughter  But the night of my speech  a surprising thing happened. At the age of     I was hit on by a    year old guy. I know  right  He was charming and I was flattered  and I declined. You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was  He could make me feel    again. I realized later that night  I'm probably the only person over    who does not want to be    again. At the age of     I fell in love with my boss  and at the age of     I learned the devastating consequences. Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at     Yep. That's what I thought. So like me  at     a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person  maybe even your boss. Unlike me  though  your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America. Of course  life is full of surprises. Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake  and I regret that mistake deeply. In       after having been swept up into an improbable romance  I was then swept up into the eye of a political  legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before. Remember  just a few years earlier  news was consumed from just three places  reading a newspaper or magazine  listening to the radio  or watching television. That was it. But that wasn't my fate. Instead  this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution. That meant we could access all the information we wanted  when we wanted it  anytime  anywhere  and when the story broke in January       it broke online. It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the Internet for a major news story  a click that reverberated around the world. What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide. I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously. This rush to judgment  enabled by technology  led to mobs of virtual stone throwers. Granted  it was before social media  but people could still comment online  email stories  and  of course  email cruel jokes. News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers  banner ads online  and to keep people tuned to the TV. Do you recall a particular image of me  say  wearing a beret  Now  I admit I made mistakes  especially wearing that beret. But the attention and judgment that I received  not the story  but that I personally received  was unprecedented. I was branded as a tramp  tart  slut  whore  bimbo  and  of course  that woman. I was seen by many but actually known by few. And I get it  it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional  had a soul  and was once unbroken. When this happened to me    years ago  there was no name for it. Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment. Today  I want to share some of my experience with you  talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations  and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others. In       I lost my reputation and my dignity. I lost almost everything  and I almost lost my life. Let me paint a picture for you. It is September of     . I'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights. I'm listening to the sound of my voice  my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before. I'm here because I've been legally required to personally authenticate all    hours of taped conversation. For the past eight months  the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head. I mean  who can remember what they said a year ago  Scared and mortified  I listen  listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day  listen as I confess my love for the president  and  of course  my heartbreak  listen to my sometimes catty  sometimes churlish  sometimes silly self being cruel  unforgiving  uncouth  listen  deeply  deeply ashamed  to the worst version of myself  a self I don't even recognize. A few days later  the Starr Report is released to Congress  and all of those tapes and transcripts  those stolen words  form a part of it. That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough  but a few weeks later  the audio tapes are aired on TV  and significant portions made available online. The public humiliation was excruciating. Life was almost unbearable. This was not something that happened with regularity back then in       and by this  I mean the stealing of people's private words  actions  conversations or photos  and then making them public    public without consent  public without context  and public without compassion. Fast forward    years to       and now social media has been born. The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine  whether or not someone actually make a mistake  and now it's for both public and private people. The consequences for some have become dire  very dire. I was on the phone with my mom in September of       and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi. Sweet  sensitive  creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man. When the online world learned of this incident  the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited. A few days later  Tyler jumped from  the George Washington Bridge to his death. He was   . My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family  and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand  and then eventually I realized she was reliving       reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night  reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open  and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that I would be humiliated to death  literally. Today  too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones. Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late. Tyler's tragic  senseless death was a turning point for me. It served to recontextualize my experiences  and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different. In       we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the Internet would take us. Since then  it has connected people in unimaginable ways  joining lost siblings  saving lives  launching revolutions  but the darkness  cyberbullying  and slut shaming that I experienced had mushroomed. Every day online  people  especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this  are so abused and humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day  and some  tragically  don't  and there's nothing virtual about that. ChildLine  a U.K. nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues  released a staggering statistic late last year  From      to       there was an    percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying. A meta analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time  cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying. And you know what shocked me  although it shouldn't have  was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger. Cruelty to others is nothing new  but online  technologically enhanced shaming is amplified  uncontained  and permanently accessible. The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family  village  school or community  but now it's the online community too. Millions of people  often anonymously  can stab you with their words  and that's a lot of pain  and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade. There is a very personal price to public humiliation  and the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price. For nearly two decades now  we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil  both on  and offline. Gossip websites  paparazzi  reality programming  politics  news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame. It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online which lends itself to trolling  invasion of privacy  and cyberbullying. This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls a culture of humiliation. Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone. Snapchat  the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the lifespan of a few seconds. You can imagine the range of content that that gets. A third party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was hacked  and         personal conversations  photos  and videos were leaked online to now have a lifespan of forever. Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked  and private  intimate  nude photos were plastered across the Internet without their permission. One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story. And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking  The documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value. But in this culture of humiliation  there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming. The price does not measure the cost to the victim  which Tyler and too many others  notably women  minorities  and members of the LGBTQ community have paid  but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them. This invasion of others is a raw material  efficiently and ruthlessly mined  packaged and sold at a profit. A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry. How is the money made  Clicks. The more shame  the more clicks. The more clicks  the more advertising dollars. We're in a dangerous cycle. The more we click on this kind of gossip  the more numb we get to the human lives behind it  and the more numb we get  the more we click. All the while  someone is making money off of the back  of someone else's suffering. With every click  we make a choice. The more we saturate our culture with public shaming  the more accepted it is  the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying  trolling  some forms of hacking  and online harassment. Why  Because they all have humiliation at their cores. This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created. Just think about it. Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs. We've seen that to be true with racism  homophobia  and plenty of other biases  today and in the past. As we've changed beliefs about same sex marriage  more people have been offered equal freedoms. When we began valuing sustainability  more people began to recycle. So as far as our culture of humiliation goes  what we need is a cultural revolution. Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop  and it's time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture. The shift begins with something simple  but it's not easy. We need to return to a long held value of compassion    compassion and empathy. Online  we've got a compassion deficit  an empathy crisis. Researcher Bren  Brown said  and I quote   Shame can't survive empathy.  Shame cannot survive empathy. I've seen some very dark days in my life  and it was the compassion and empathy from my family  friends  professionals  and sometimes even strangers that saved me. Even empathy from one person can make a difference. The theory of minority influence  proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici  says that even in small numbers  when there's consistency over time  change can happen. In the online world  we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders. To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy  we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation. Trust me  compassionate comments help abate the negativity. We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues  like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S.  In the U.K.  there's Anti Bullying Pro  and in Australia  there's Project Rockit. We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression  but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression. We all want to be heard  but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention. The Internet is  the superhighway for the id  but online  showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world. We need to communicate online with compassion  consume news with compassion  and click with compassion. Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline. I'd like to end on a personal note. In the past nine months  the question I've been  asked the most is why. Why now  Why was I  sticking my head above the parapet  You can read between the lines in those questions  and the answer has nothing to do with politics. The top note answer was and is because it's time  time to stop tip toeing around my past  time to stop living a life of opprobrium  and time to take back my narrative. It's also not just about saving myself. Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing  You can survive it. I know it's hard. It may not be painless  quick or easy  but you can insist on a different ending to your story. Have compassion for yourself. We all deserve compassion  and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world. Thank you for listening. Let me show you something. The boy is petting the elephant. Those are people that are going on an airplane. That's a big airplane. Fei Fei Li  This is a three year old child describing what she sees in a series of photos. She might still have a lot to learn about this world  but she's already an expert at one very important task  to make sense of what she sees. Our society is more technologically advanced than ever. We send people to the moon  we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like. Yet  our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task. So I'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision  one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science. Yes  we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves  but without smart vision  they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road  which can be run over  and a rock that size  which should be avoided. We have made fabulous megapixel cameras  but we have not delivered sight to the blind. Drones can fly over massive land  but don't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests. Security cameras are everywhere  but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool. Photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life. They're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human  or teams of humans  could hope to view  and you and I are contributing to that at this TED. Yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous content. So in other words  collectively as a society  we're very much blind  because our smartest  machines are still blind.  Why is this so hard   you may ask. Cameras can take pictures like this one by converting lights into a two dimensional array of numbers known as pixels  but these are just lifeless numbers. They do not carry meaning in themselves. Just like to hear is not the same as to listen  to take pictures is not the same as to see  and by seeing  we really mean understanding. In fact  it took Mother Nature     million years of hard work to do this task  and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains  not the eyes themselves. So vision begins with the eyes  but it truly takes place in the brain. So for    years now  starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab  I've been working with my mentors  collaborators and students to teach computers to see. Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning. It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence. So ultimately  we want to teach the machines to see just like we do  naming objects  identifying people  inferring  D geometry of things  understanding relations  emotions  actions and intentions. You and I weave together entire stories of people  places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them. The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects  the building block of the visual world. In its simplest terms  imagine this teaching process as showing the computers some training images of a particular object  let's say cats  and designing a model that learns from these training images. How hard can this be  After all  a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors  and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling. We'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face  a chubby body  two pointy ears  and a long tail  and that looked all fine. But what about this cat  It's all curled up. Now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model. But what if cats are hidden  What about these silly cats  Now you get my point. Even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model  and that's just one object. So about eight years ago  a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking. No one tells a child how to see  especially in the early years. They learn this through real world experiences and examples. If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras  they take one picture about every     milliseconds  the average time an eye movement is made. So by age three  a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world. That's a lot of training examples. So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms  my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality. Once we know this  we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before  perhaps thousands of times more  and together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University  we launched the ImageNet project in     . Luckily  we didn't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years. We went to the Internet  the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created. We downloaded nearly a billion images and used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to help us to label these images. At its peak  ImageNet was one of the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers  together  almost        workers from     countries around the world helped us to clean  sort and label nearly a billion candidate images. That was how much effort it took to capture even a fraction of the imagery a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years. In hindsight  this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now  but back in       it was not so obvious. We were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while. Some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure  and we were constantly struggling for research funding. Once  I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet. After all  that's how I funded my college years. So we carried on. In       the ImageNet project delivered a database of    million images across        classes of objects and things organized by everyday English words. In both quantity and quality  this was an unprecedented scale. As an example  in the case of cats  we have more than        cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats. We were thrilled to have put together ImageNet  and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it  so in the TED fashion  we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free. Now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain  we're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves. As it turned out  the wealth of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network  pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima  Geoff Hinton  and Yann LeCun back in the     s and '  s. Just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons  a basic operating unit in a neural network is a neuron like node. It takes input from other nodes and sends output to others. Moreover  these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers  also similar to the brain. In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model  it has    million nodes      million parameters  and    billion connections. That's an enormous model. Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model  the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected. It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition. This is a computer telling us this picture contains a cat and where the cat is. Of course there are more things than cats  so here's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear  a dog  a person  and a small kite in the background  or a picture of very busy things like a man  a skateboard  railings  a lampost  and so on. Sometimes  when the computer is not so confident about what it sees  we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much  just like we would do  but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are  like the make  model  year of the cars. We applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images across hundreds of American cities  and we have learned something really interesting  first  it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes. But surprisingly  car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities  or voting patterns by zip codes. So wait a minute. Is that it  Has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities  Not so fast. So far  we have just taught the computer to see objects. This is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns. It's an incredible accomplishment  but it's only the first step. Soon  another developmental milestone will be hit  and children begin to communicate in sentences. So instead of saying this is a cat in the picture  you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed. So to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences  the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm has to take another step. Now  the computer has to learn from both pictures as well as natural language sentences generated by humans. Just like the brain integrates vision and language  we developed a model that connects parts of visual things like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences. About four months ago  we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time. Now  I'm ready to show you what the computer says when it sees the picture that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk. A large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway. FFL  Of course  we're still working hard to improve our algorithms  and it still has a lot to learn. And the computer still makes mistakes. FFL  So of course  when it sees too many cats  it thinks everything might look like a cat. FFL  Or  if it hasn't seen a toothbrush  it confuses it with a baseball bat. FFL  We haven't taught Art     to the computers. FFL  And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature like you and I do. So it has been a long journey. To get from age zero to three was hard. The real challenge is to go from three to    and far beyond. Let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again. So far  we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture. FFL  But there's so much more  to this picture than just a person and a cake. What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time. The boy is wearing his favorite t shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney  and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind at that moment. This is my son Leo. On my quest for visual intelligence  I think of Leo constantly and the future world he will live in. When machines can see  doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients. Cars will run smarter and safer on the road. Robots  not just humans  will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded. We will discover new species   better materials  and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines. Little by little  we're giving sight to the machines. First  we teach them to see. Then  they help us to see better. For the first time  human eyes won't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world. We will not only use the machines for their intelligence  we will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine. This is my quest  to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for Leo and for the world. Thank you.  Where are you from   said the pale  tattooed man.  Where are you from   It's September              days after the worst attack on America since World War II. Everyone wonders about the next plane. People are looking for scapegoats. The president   the night before  pledges to  bring our enemies to justice  or bring justice to our enemies.  And in the Dallas mini mart  a Dallas mini part surrounded by tire shops and strip joints a Bangladeshi immigrant  works the register. Back home  Raisuddin Bhuiyan was a big man  an Air Force officer. But he dreamed of a  fresh start in America. If he had to work briefly in a mini mart to save up for I.T. classes and his wedding in two months  so be it. Then  on September      that tattooed man enters the mart. He holds a shotgun. Raisuddin knows the drill  puts cash on the counter. This time  the man doesn't  touch the money.  Where are you from   he asks.  Excuse me   Raisuddin answers. His accent betrays him. The tattooed man  a self styled true American vigilante  shoots Raisuddin in revenge for     . Raisuddin feels millions of bees stinging his face. In fact  dozens of scalding   birdshot pellets puncture his head. Behind the counter  he lays in blood. He cups a hand over his forehead to keep in the brains on which he'd gambled everything. He recites verses from the Koran  begging his God to live. He senses he is dying. He didn't die. His right eye left him. His fianc e left him. His landlord  the mini mart owner  kicked him out. Soon he was homeless and         dollars in medical debt  including a fee for dialing  for an ambulance. But Raisuddin lived. And years later  he would ask what he could do to repay his God and become worthy of this second chance. He would come to believe  in fact  that this chance called for him to give a second chance to a man we might think deserved no chance at all. Twelve years ago  I was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world. Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants  I settled on the ultimate rebellion  against my parents  moving to the country they had worked so damn hard to get out of. What I thought might be a six month stint in Mumbai stretched to six years. I became a writer and found myself amid a magical story  the awakening of hope across much of the so called Third World. Six years ago  I returned to America and realized something  The American Dream was thriving  but only in India. In America  not so much. In fact  I observed that  America was fracturing into two distinct societies  a republic of dreams and a republic of fears. And then  I stumbled onto this  incredible tale of two lives and of these two Americas that brutally collided in that Dallas mini mart. I knew at once I wanted to learn more  and eventually that I would write a book about them  for their story was the story  of America's fracturing and of how it might be put back together. After he was shot  Raisuddin's life grew no easier. The day after admitting him  the hospital discharged him. His right eye couldn't see. He couldn't speak. Metal peppered his face. But he had no insurance   so they bounced him. His family in Bangladesh  begged him   Come home.  But he told them he had  a dream to see about. He found telemarketing work  then he became an Olive Garden waiter  because where better to get over his fear of white people than the Olive Garden  Now  as a devout Muslim  he refused alcohol  didn't touch the stuff. Then he learned that not selling it would slash his pay. So he reasoned  like a budding  American pragmatist   Well  God wouldn't want me to starve  would he   And before long  in some months   Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's highest grossing alcohol pusher. He found a man who taught him database administration. He got part time I.T. gigs. Eventually  he landed a six figure job at a blue chip tech company in Dallas. But as America began to work for Raisuddin  he avoided the classic error of the fortunate  assuming you're the rule   not the exception. In fact  he observed that many with the fortune of being born American were nonetheless trapped in lives that  made second chances like his impossible. He saw it at the Olive Garden itself  where so many of his colleagues had childhood horror stories of family dysfunction  chaos   addiction  crime. He'd heard a similar tale about the man who shot him back when he attended his trial. The closer Raisuddin got to the America he had coveted from afar  the more he realized there was another  equally real  America that was stingier with second chances. The man who shot Raisuddin grew up in that stingier America. From a distance  Mark Stroman was always the spark of parties  always making girls feel pretty. Always working  no matter what  drugs or fights he'd had the night before. But he'd always wrestled with demons. He entered the world through the three gateways that doom so many young American men  bad parents  bad schools  bad prisons. His mother told him  regretfully  as a boy that she'd been just    dollars  short of aborting him. Sometimes  that little boy  would be at school  he'd suddenly pull a knife  on his fellow classmates. Sometimes that same little boy would be at his grandparents'  tenderly feeding horses. He was getting arrested before he shaved  first juvenile  then prison. He became a casual white supremacist and  like so many around him   a drug addled and absent father. And then  before long  he found himself on death row  for in his      counter jihad   he had shot not one mini mart clerk  but three. Only Raisuddin survived. Strangely  death row was  the first institution that left Stroman better. His old influences quit him. The people entering his life  were virtuous and caring  pastors  journalists  European pen pals. They listened to him  prayed with him  helped him question himself. And sent him on a journey  of introspection and betterment. He finally faced the hatred  that had defined his life. He read Viktor Frankl   the Holocaust survivor and regretted his swastika tattoos. He found God. Then one day in           years after his crimes  Stroman received news. One of the men he'd shot  the survivor  was fighting to save his life. You see  late in       eight years after that shooting  Raisuddin had gone on his own journey  a pilgrimage to Mecca. Amid its crowds   he felt immense gratitude  but also duty. He recalled promising God   as he lay dying in       that if he lived  he would serve  humanity all his days. Then  he'd gotten busy  relaying the bricks of a life. Now it was time to pay his debts. And he decided  upon reflection  that his method of payment would be an intervention  in the cycle of vengeance between the Muslim and Western worlds. And how would he intervene  By forgiving Stroman publicly in the name of Islam and its doctrine of mercy. And then suing the state of Texas and its governor Rick Perry to prevent them from executing Stroman  exactly like most people  shot in the face do. Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired  not only by faith. A newly minted American citizen  he had come to believe that Stroman was the product of a hurting America that couldn't just be lethally injected away. That insight is what moved me  to write my book  The True American.  This immigrant begging America  to be as merciful to a native son as it had been to an adopted one. In the mini mart  all those years earlier  not just two men   but two Americas collided. An America that still dreams   still strives  still imagines that tomorrow can build on today  and an America that has resigned to fate  buckled under stress and chaos  lowered expectations  an ducked into the oldest of refuges  the tribal fellowship of one's own narrow kind. And it was Raisuddin  despite being a newcomer  despite being attacked  despite being homeless and traumatized  who belonged to that republic of dreams and Stroman who belonged to that  other wounded country  despite being born with the privilege of a native white man. I realized these men's stories formed an urgent parable about America. The country I am so proud to call my own wasn't living through a  generalized decline as seen in Spain or Greece   where prospects were dimming for everyone. America is simultaneously the most and the least successful country in the industrialized world. Launching the world's best companies  even as record numbers  of children go hungry. Seeing life expectancy drop for large groups  even as it polishes  the world's best hospitals. America today is a sprightly young body  hit by one of those strokes  that sucks the life from one side  while leaving the other worryingly perfect. On July           right after  a sobbing Raisuddin testified in defense of Stroman's life  Stroman was killed by lethal injection by the state he so loved. Hours earlier  when Raisuddin still thought he could still save Stroman  the two men got to speak  for the second time ever. Here is an excerpt from their phone call. Raisuddin   Mark  you should know  that I am praying for God  the most compassionate and gracious. I forgive you and I do not hate you. I never hated you.  Stroman   You are a remarkable person. Thank you from my heart. I love you  bro.  Even more amazingly  after the execution  Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's  eldest daughter  Amber  an ex convinct and an addict. and offered his help.  You may have lost a father   he told her   but you've gained an uncle.  He wanted her  too  to have  a second chance. If human history were a parade  America's float would be  a neon shrine to second chances. But America  generous with second chances to the children of other lands  today grows miserly with first chances to the children of its own. America still dazzles at allowing anybody to become an American. But it is losing its luster at allowing every American to become a somebody. Over the last decade  seven million foreigners gained American citizenship. Remarkable. In the meanwhile  how many Americans gained a place in the middle class  Actually  the net influx was negative. Go back further   and it's even more striking  Since the   s  the middle class has shrunk by    percent  mainly because of the people tumbling out of it. And my reporting around the country tells me the problem is grimmer than simple inequality. What I observe is a pair of secessions from the unifying center of American life. An affluent secession of up  up and away  into elite enclaves of the educated and into a global matrix of work  money and connections  and an impoverished secession  of down and out into disconnected  dead end lives that the fortunate scarcely see. And don't console yourself  that you are the    percent. If you live near a Whole Foods  if no one in your family serves  in the military  if you're paid by the year  not the hour  if most people you know finished college  if no one you know uses meth  if you married once and remain married  if you're not one of    million Americans with a criminal record    if any or all of these things  describe you  then accept the possibility that actually  you may not know what's going on and you may be part of the problem. Other generations had to build  a fresh society after slavery  pull through a depression  defeat fascism  freedom ride in Mississippi. The moral challenge of  my generation  I believe  is to reacquaint these two Americas  to choose union over secession once again. This ins't a problem we can tax or tax cut away. It won't be solved by tweeting harder  building slicker apps  or starting one more  artisanal coffee roasting service. It is a moral challenge that begs  each of us in the flourishing America to take on the wilting America as our own  as Raisuddin tried to do. Like him  we can make pilgrimages. And there  in Baltimore and Oregon  and Appalachia  find new purpose  as he did. We can immerse ourselves  in that other country  bear witness to its hopes and sorrows  and  like Raisuddin  ask what we can do. What can you do  What can you do  What can we do  How might we build  a more merciful country  We  the greatest inventors in the world  can invent solutions to the problems  of that America  not only our own. We  the writers and the journalists   can cover that America's stories  instead of shutting down  bureaus in its midst. We can finance that America's ideas  instead of ideas from New York  and San Francisco. We can put our stethoscopes to its backs  teach there  go to court there  make there  live there  pray there. This  I believe  is the calling  of a generation. An America whose two halves learn again to stride  to plow  to forge  to dare together. A republic of chances  rewoven  renewed  begins with us. Thank you. Tonight  I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one  a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life  and in yours. When I was    years old  I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stories. At almost the exact same time  I found out that my dad  who I was very  very close to  was gay. I was taken completely by surprise. We were a very tight knit family  and I was crushed. At some point  in one of our strained conversations  my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots. He told me that one night in       a group of young black and Latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan called the Stonewall Inn  and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement. It was an amazing story  and it piqued my interest. So I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more. With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker  we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night. Recording these interviews  I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to. I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing  fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met. It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience. I dedicated the program to my dad  it changed my relationship with him  and it changed my life. Over the next    years  I made many more radio documentaries  working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media. Over and over again  I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people  particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter. I could literally see people's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone. In       I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the Bowery in Manhattan. Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades. They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next. Later  I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang. I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page. He stood there staring at it in silence  then he grabbed the book out of my hand and started running down the long  narrow hallway holding it over his head shouting   I exist  I exist.  In many ways   I exist  became the clarion call for StoryCorps  this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago. The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head. Traditionally  broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people  but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work  and see if we could give many  many  many people the chance to be listened to in this way. So in Grand Central Terminal    years ago  we built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their life. You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside. You sit across from  say  your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk. Many people think of it as  if this was to be our last conversation  what would I want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me  At the end of the session  you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that your great great great grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story. So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being. I had no idea if it would work  but from the very beginning  it did. People treated the experience with incredible respect  and amazing conversations happened inside. I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth. This is    year old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother  Sarah. Josh has Asperger's syndrome. As you may know  kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially. They usually have obsessions. In Josh's case  it's with animals  so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago. do you think your life would be different without animals  Sarah Littman  I think it would be an eight without animals  because they add so much pleasure to life. JL  How else do you think your life would be different without them  SL  I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes. JL  Well  I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything. SL  Yeah  I'm not a big snake person    JL  But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate. SL  Yeah  it really is. JL  Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child  SL  I remember when you were a baby  you had really bad colic  so you would just cry and cry. JL  What's colic  SL  It's when you get this stomach ache and all you do is scream for  like  four hours. JL  Even louder than Amy does  SL  You were pretty loud  but Amy's was more high pitched. JL  I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more  like she's the perfect little angel. SL  Well  I can understand why you think that people like Amy more  and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome  but being friendly comes easily to Amy  whereas I think for you it's more difficult  but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much. JL  Like Ben or Eric or Carlos  SL  Yeah    JL  Like I have better quality friends but less quantity   Laughter  SL  I wouldn't judge the quality  but I think    JL  I mean  first it was like  Amy loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia  she loved Claudia  then she hated Claudia. SL  Part of that's a girl thing  honey. The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends  and really that's what you need in life. JL  Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born  Did I meet your expectations  SL  You've exceeded my expectations  sweetie  because  sure  you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like  but you have made me grow so much as a parent  because you think    JL  Well  I was the one who made you a parent. SL  You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point.  Laughter  But also because you think differently from what they tell you in the parenting books  I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you  and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person  and I'll always thank you for that. JL  And that helped when Amy was born  SL  And that helped when Amy was born  but you are so incredibly special to me and I'm so lucky to have you as my son. David Isay  After this story ran on public radio  Josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was. His mom  Sarah  bound them together in a book  and when Josh got picked on at school  they would read the letters together. I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight. Sarah Littman and her son Josh  who is now an honors student in college. You know  a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories  and it's not because they're sad. Most of them aren't. I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment  when sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advertisement. It's kind of the anti reality TV. Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich. Nobody comes to get famous. It's simply an act of generosity and love. So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness  courage  decency and dignity  and when you hear that kind of story  it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground. So this experiment  in Grand Central worked  and we expanded across the country. Today  more than         people in all    states in thousands of cities and towns across America have recorded StoryCorps interviews. It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered. We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience. Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps traveling the country  gathering the wisdom of humanity. They call it bearing witness  and if you ask them  all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good. And I think for the first years of StoryCorps  you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening  but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country    rich  poor  five years old to         different languages  across the political spectrum    you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something. I've also learned so much from these interviews. I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen  like this interview between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her. I always feel guilty when I say  I love you  to you. And I say it so often. I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am  it's coming from me. It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio  and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house. Annie Perasa  If I don't have a note on the kitchen table  I think there's something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning. DP  Well  the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen. AP  To my princess  The weather outside today is extremely rainy. I'll call you at       in the morning. DP  It's a romantic weather report. AP  And I love you. I love you. I love you. DP  When a guy is happily married  no matter what happens at work  no matter what happens in the rest of the day  there's a shelter when you get home  there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying   Get your hands off me.  Being married is like having a color television set. You never want to go back to black and white. DI  Danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth  but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of Hollywood's leading men put together. What else have I learned  I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive. I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength. Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson. When Oshea was a teenager  he murdered Mary's only son  Laramiun Byrd  in a gang fight. A dozen years later  Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son's life. Slowly and remarkably  they became friends  and when he was finally released from the penitentiary  Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary. This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed. I didn't see him graduate  and now you're going to college. I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate. I didn't see him get married. Hopefully one day  I'll be able to experience that with you. Oshea Israel  Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation. It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path. You still believe in me  and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you  it's amazing. MJ  I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together  even with us sitting here looking at each other right now. I know it's not an easy thing  so I admire that you can do this. OI  I love you  lady. MJ  I love you too  son. DI  And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people  and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice. Like the story of Alexis Martinez  who was born Arthur Martinez in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago. In the interview  she talks with her daughter Lesley about joining a gang as a young man  and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be. This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley. I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed to be in my granddaughters' lives  and you blew that completely out of the water  you and your husband. One of the fruits of that is  in my relationship with my granddaughters  they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she. Lesley Martinez  But they're free to talk about it. AM  They're free to talk about it  but that  to me  is a miracle. LM  You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe. We're not going to cut you off  and that's something I've always wanted you to just know  that you're loved. AM  You know  I live this every day now. I walk down the streets as a woman  and I really am at peace with who I am. I mean  I wish I had a softer voice maybe  but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day. DI  Now I walk in love. I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps. It takes some courage to have these conversations. StoryCorps speaks to our mortality. Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone. There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying. He wrote a book called  The Four Things That Matter Most  about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die  thank you  I love you  forgive me  I forgive you. They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another  and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth. It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about    no regrets  nothing left unsaid. And it's hard and it takes courage  but that's why we're alive  right  So  the TED Prize. When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago about the possibility of the Prize  I was completely floored. They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity  no more than    words. So I thought about it  I wrote my    words  and a few weeks later  Chris called and said   Go for it.  So here is my wish  that you will help us take everything we've learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history. How are we going to do that  With this. We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these  and it has powers I never could have imagined    years ago when I started StoryCorps. It has a microphone  it can tell you how to do things  and it can send audio files. Those are the key ingredients. So the first part of the wish is already underway. Over the past couple of months  the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone  anywhere  anytime. Remember  StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation  which is preserved forever  but at this very moment  we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app. The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the StoryCorps interview process  helps you pick questions  and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview  and then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress. That's the easy part  the technology. The real challenge is up to you  to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world  so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year  we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more. Imagine  for example  a national homework assignment where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving  so that in one single weekend an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured. Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people  and in doing so  begin to build bonds of trust  or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview on their   th birthday  or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are  what they've learned in life  and how they want to be remembered. Ten years ago  I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist  and became a well known gay activist. This is the picture of us at that interview. I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago  when my dad  who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients    hours a week  was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away very suddenly a few days later. It was June           the anniversary of the Stonewall riots. I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died. I have a couple of young kids at home  and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session. I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did  but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings. Every day  people come up to me and say   I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother  but I waited too long.  Now  no one has to wait anymore. At this moment  when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential  join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important. Help us create this gift to our children  this testament to who we are as human beings. I hope you'll help us make this wish come true. Interview a family member  a friend or even a stranger. Together  we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity  and maybe in doing so  we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less. Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important. And maybe  just maybe  it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life  every single life  matters equally and infinitely. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a potter  which seems like a fairly humble vocation. I know a lot about pots. I've spent about    years making them. One of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice and being trained as a potter is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing  that I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff  and that the limitations of my capacity  my ability  was based on my hands and my imagination  that if I wanted to make a really nice bowl and I didn't know how to make a foot yet  I would have to learn how to make a foot  that that process of learning has been very  very helpful to my life. I feel like  as a potter  you also start to learn how to shape the world. There have been times in my artistic capacity that I wanted to reflect on other really important moments in the history of the U.S.  the history of the world where tough things happened  but how do you talk about tough ideas without separating people from that content  Could I use art like these old  discontinued firehoses from Alabama  to talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '  s  Is it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects  My dad was a roofer  construction guy  he owned small businesses  and at     he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance. Now  a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't. It was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio  but I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me  if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material as something very special. And by elevating the material and my dad's skill  could we start to think about tar just like clay  in a new way  shaping it differently  helping us to imagine what was possible  After clay  I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials  and my studio grew a lot because I thought  well  it's not really about the material  it's about our capacity to shape things. I became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that  were happening just outside my studio. Just to give you a little bit of context  I live in Chicago. I live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider. For those of you who are not Chicagoans  that won't mean anything  but if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider  there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset. The neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing. It's a neighborhood that has seen better days. It is not a gated community by far. There is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood  and while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career  there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio. All of us know about failing housing markets and the challenges of blight  and I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others  but I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond have the challenge of blight  abandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with. And so I thought  is there a way that I could start to think about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice  And that if I was thinking along with other creatives    architects  engineers  real estate finance people    that us together might be able to kind of think in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities. And so I bought a building. The building was really affordable. We tricked it out. We made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening on my block. Once I bought the building for about        dollars  I didn't have any money left. So I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance. This is performance art  and people would come over  and I would start sweeping. Because the broom was free and sweeping was free. It worked out. But we would use the building  then  to stage exhibitions  small dinners  and we found that that building on my block  Dorchester    we now referred to the block as Dorchester projects    that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site for lots of different kinds of activity. We turned the building into what we called now the Archive House. The Archive House would do all of these amazing things. Very significant people in the city and beyond would find themselves in the middle of the hood. And that's when I felt like maybe there was a relationship between my history with clay and this new thing that was starting to develop  that we were slowly starting to reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city. One house turned into a few houses  and we always tried to suggest that not only is creating a beautiful vessel important  but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important. So we were not only thinking about development  but we were thinking about the program  thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another  between one neighbor and another. This building became what we call the Listening House  and it has a collection of discarded books from the Johnson Publishing Corporation  and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business. I was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could with whatever and whoever would join me. In Chicago  there's amazing building stock. This building  which had been the former crack house on the block  and when the building became abandoned  it became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there. So this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House. Black Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films that were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me  that if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film  we could. If we wanted to show  Car Wash   we could. That would be awesome. The building we soon outgrew  and we had to move to a larger space. Black Cinema House  which was made from just a small piece of clay  had to grow into a much larger piece of clay  which is now my studio. What I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies  that some of the things that I was doing in these buildings that had been left behind  they were not the uses by which the buildings were built  and that there are city policies that say   Hey  a house that is residential needs to stay residential.  But what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there  That the people who have the means to leave have already left  What do we do with these abandoned buildings  And so I was trying to wake them up using culture. We found that that was so exciting for folk  and people were so responsive to the work  that we had to then find bigger buildings. By the time we found bigger buildings  there was  in part  the resources  necessary to think about those things. In this bank that we called the Arts Bank  it was in pretty bad shape. There was about six feet of standing water. It was a difficult project to finance  because banks weren't interested in the neighborhood because people weren't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there. It was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere. And so we just started imagining  what else could happen in this building  And so now that the rumor of my block has spread  and lots of people are starting to visit  we've found that the bank can now be a center for exhibition  archives  music performance  and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat  that we kind of made a fire. One of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation. We've also started to collect memorabilia from American history  from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood. Some of these images are degraded images of black people  kind of histories of very challenging content  and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class  In some ways  the bank represents a hub  that we're trying to create a pretty  hardcore node of cultural activity  and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there  that the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed  which is now around    or    units  that if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that  and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt    that this place where people never wanted to be would become an important destination for folk from all over the country and world. In some ways  it feels very much like I'm a potter  that we tackle the things that are at our wheel  we try with the skill that we have to think about this next bowl that I want to make. And it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood to a cultural district to thinking about the city  and at every point  there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn. I've never learned so much about zoning law in my life. I never thought I'd have to. But as a result of that  I'm finding that there's not just room for my own artistic practice  there's room for a lot of other artistic practices. So people started asking us   Well  Theaster  how are you going to go to scale   and   What's your sustainability plan   And what I found was that I couldn't export myself  that what seems necessary in cities like Akron  Ohio  and Detroit  Michigan  and Gary  Indiana  is that there are people in those places who already believe in those places  that are already dying to make those places beautiful  and that often  those people who are passionate about a place are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen  or disconnected from a contingency of people that could help make things happen. So now  we're starting to give advice around the country on how to start with what you got  how to start with the things that are in front of you  how to make something out of nothing  how to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block or at the scale of the city. Thank you so much. June Cohen  Thank you. So I think many people watching this will be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end  How can they do this in their own city  You can't export yourself. Give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours  Theaster Gates  One of the things I've found that's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project  like an old house  but what's the relationship between an old house  a local school  a small bodega  and is there some kind of synergy between those things  Can you get those folk talking  I've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed  they still often have a pulse. How do you identify the pulse in that place  the passionate people  and then how do you get folk who have been fighting  slogging for    years  reenergized about the place that they live  And so someone has to do that work. If I were a traditional developer  I would be talking about buildings alone  and then putting a  For Lease  sign in the window. I think that you actually have to curate more than that  that there's a way in which you have to be mindful about  what are the businesses that I want to grow here  And then  are there people who live in this place who want to grow those businesses with me  Because I think it's not just a cultural space or housing  there has to be the recreation of an economic core. So thinking about those things together feels right. JC  It's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for    years. Are there any methods you've found that have helped break through  TG  Yeah  I think that now there are lots of examples of folk who are doing amazing work  but those methods are sometimes like  when the media is constantly saying that only violent things happen in a place  then based on your skill set and the particular context  what are the things that you can do in your neighborhood to kind of fight some of that  So I've found that if you're a theater person  you have outdoor street theater festivals. In some cases  we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods to do things that are a certain kind of splashy  but if we can then find ways of making sure that people who are local to a place  plus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally  when those people get together  I think really amazing things can happen. JC  So interesting. And how can you make sure that the projects you're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to take advantage of them. TG  Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds. JC  Let's go there. TG  Right now  Grand Crossing is    percent black  or at least living  and we know that maybe who owns property in a place is different from who walks the streets every day. So it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already in the process of being something different than it is today. But are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or a mission based development that starts to protect some of the space that happens  because when you have       empty lots in a city  you want something to happen there  but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece  but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece  and I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated  but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness  that part doesn't live anymore. So how do you start to grow up important watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are made available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time. JC  That makes so much sense. One more question  You make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts. There would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent on basic services for the disadvantaged. How do you combat that viewpoint  or come against it  TG  I believe that beauty  is a basic service. Often what I have found is that when there are resources that have not been made available to certain under resourced cities or neighborhoods or communities  that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite  and that I can't do everything  but I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture and get people kind of reinvested in their place  other kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow  and then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand  and the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities  they also become very poetic. JC  It makes perfect sense to me. Theaster  thank you so much for being here with us today. Thank you. Theaster Gates. When I wrote my memoir  the publishers were really confused. Was it about me as a child refugee  or as a woman who set up a high tech software company back in the     s  one that went public and eventually employed over       people  Or was it as a mother of an autistic child  Or as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money  Well  it turns out  I'm all of these. So let me tell you my story. All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna  part of the Kindertransport that saved nearly        Jewish children from Nazi Europe. I was five years old  clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to  what was going on.  What is England and  why am I going there   I'm only alive because so long ago   I was helped by generous strangers. I was lucky  and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents. But  sadly  I never bonded  with them again. But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible. And I love England  my adopted country  with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel. I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving. And then  I just got on with it. Let me take you back to the early     s. To get past the gender issues of the time  I set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain. But it was also a company of women  a company for women  an early social business. And people laughed at the very idea because software  at that time  was given away free with hardware. Nobody would buy software  certainly not from a woman. Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees  there was a glass ceiling to our progress. And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often  and I wanted opportunities for women. I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage  or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home working organization. We pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break. We pioneered all sorts of new  flexible work methods  job shares  profit sharing   and eventually  co ownership when I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me. For years  I was the first woman this  or the only woman that. And in those days  I couldn't work on the stock exchange  I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane. Indeed  I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission. My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay. Nobody really expected much  from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and  family responsibilities. And I couldn't really face that  so I started to challenge the conventions of the time  even to the extent of changing my name from  Stephanie  to  Steve  in my business development letters  so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she. My company  called Freelance Programmers  and that's precisely what it was  couldn't have started smaller   on the dining room table  and financed by the equivalent of     dollars in today's terms  and financed by my labor and  by borrowing against the house. My interests were scientific   the market was commercial    things such as payroll  which I found rather boring. So I had to compromise with  operational research work  which had the intellectual challenge  that interested me and the commercial value  that was valued by the clients  things like scheduling freight trains  time tabling buses  stock control  lots and lots of stock control. And eventually  the work came in. We disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices  one of the very first to do so. And who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder  of Supersonic Concord would have been done by a bunch  of women working in their own homes. All we used was a simple   trust the staff  approach and a simple telephone. We even used to ask job applicants    Do you have access to a telephone   An early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols. And software was and still is a maddeningly hard to control activity  so that was enormously valuable. We used the standards ourselves  we were even paid to update  them over the years  and eventually  they were adopted by NATO. Our programmers    remember  only women  including gay and transgender    worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts defining each task to be done. And they then wrote code   usually machine code  sometimes binary code  which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re punched   in order to verify it. All this  before it ever got near a computer. That was programming in the early     s. In          years from startup  equal opportunity legislation  came in in Britain and that made it illegal to have  our pro female policies. And as an example of  unintended consequences  my female company had to let the men in. When I started my company of women  the men said   How interesting  because it only works because it's small.  And later  as it became sizable   they accepted   Yes  it is sizable now  but of no strategic interest.  And later  when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars  and I'd made    of the staff  into millionaires  they sort of said   Well done  Steve   You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads  They're flat on top for being  patted patronizingly. And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink. Let me share with you  two secrets of success  Surround yourself with first class people and people that you like  and choose your partner very  very carefully. Because the other day when I said    My husband's an angel   a woman complained     You're lucky   she said   mine's still alive.  If success were easy   we'd all be millionaires. But in my case  it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed  crisis. Our late son  Giles  was an only child  a beautiful  contented baby. And then  at two and a half  like a changeling in a fairy story  he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild   unmanageable toddler. Not the terrible twos  he was profoundly autistic  and he never spoke again. Giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up to pioneer services for autism. And then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school for pupils with autism and a medical research charity  again  all for autism. Because whenever I found a gap in services  I tried to help. I like doing new things  and making new things happen. And I've just started a three year  think tank for autism. And so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems  I've also founded  the Oxford Internet Institute and other IT ventures. The Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology  but on the social  economic  legal and ethical issues of the Internet. Giles died unexpectedly    years ago now. And I have learned to live without him  and I have learned to live  without his need of me. Philanthropy is all that I do now. I need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me. It's one thing to have an idea  for an enterprise  but as many people in this room will know  making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy  self belief and determination  the courage to risk family and home  and a      commitment  that borders on the obsessive. So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic. I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility. Work is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else. We live our lives forward. So what has all that taught me  I learned that tomorrow's  never going to be like today  and certainly nothing like yesterday. And that made me able to cope with change  indeed  eventually to welcome change  though I'm told I'm still very difficult. Thank you very much. I'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture. A hundred years ago  we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia  that  if they took hold  would take us away quite quickly. We tended to die at home  in our own beds  looked after by family  although that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care. And then in the   th century a lot of things changed. We developed new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases. New medical technologies like x ray machines were invented. And because they were so big and expensive  we needed large  centralized buildings to keep them in  and they became our modern hospitals. After the Second World War  a lot of countries set up  universal healthcare systems so that everyone who needed treatment could get it. The result was that lifespans extended from about    at the start of the century to almost double that today. The   th century was this time of huge  optimism about what science could offer  but with all of the focus on life  death was forgotten  even as our approach to death changed dramatically. Now  I'm an architect  and for the past year and a half I've been looking at these changes and at what they mean for architecture related to death and dying. We now tend to die of cancer and heart disease  and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives. During that period  we'll likely spend a lot of time  in hospitals and hospices and care homes. Now  we've all been in a modern hospital. You know those fluorescent lights and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs. Hospital architecture has earned its bad reputation. But the surprising thing is  it wasn't always like this. This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti  built in      by Brunelleschi  who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time. And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today  what amazes me is this building's ambition. It's just a really great building. It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air  and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings  so they just feel more comfortable to be in. And it's also beautiful. Somehow  we've forgotten that that's even possible for a hospital. Now  if we want better buildings for dying  then we have to talk about it  but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable  we don't talk about it  and we don't question how we as a society approach death. One of the things that surprised me most in my research  though  is how changeable attitudes actually are. This is the first crematorium in the U.K.  which was built in Woking in the     s. And when this was first built  there were protests in the local village. Cremation wasn't socially acceptable  and   .  percent of people got buried. And yet  only a hundred years later  three quarters of us get cremated. People are actually really open to changing things if they're given the chance to talk about them. So this conversation about death and architecture was what I wanted to start when I did my first exhibition on it in Venice in June  which was called  Death in Venice.  It was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it. This is one of our exhibits  which is an interactive map of London that shows just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death and dying  and as you wave your hand across the map  the name of that piece of real estate  the building or cemetery  is revealed. Another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them. And they showed people's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuaries  and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death. We wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die. Now  the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition  especially the audio visual works. We had people dancing and running and jumping as they tried to activate the exhibits in different ways  and at a certain point they would kind of stop and remember that they were in an exhibition about death  and that maybe that's not how you're supposed to act. But actually  I would question whether there is one way that you're supposed to act around death  and if there's not  I'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is  and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like  and mightn't it be a little less like this and a little more like this  Thank you. I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma  retinal cancer. My right eye was removed at seven months of age. I was    months when they removed my left eye. The first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery  probably looking for the one who did this to me. Evidently  wandering around the nursery was not a problem for me without eyes. The problem was getting caught. It's impressions about blindness that are far more threatening to blind people than the blindness itself. Think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness. Think about your reactions when I first came onto the stage  or the prospect of your own blindness  or a loved one going blind. The terror is incomprehensible to most of us  because blindness is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness  hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown. How poetic. Fortunately for me  my parents were not poetic. They were pragmatic. They understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind  and the mind is adaptable. They believed that I should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else. In their own words  I would move out    which I did when I was       I will pay taxes    thanks     Laughter     and they knew the difference between love and fear. Fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge. They knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge. I was not raised with fear. They put my freedom first before all else  because that is what love does. Now  moving forward  how do I manage today  The world is a much larger nursery. Fortunately  I have my trusty long cane  longer than the canes used by most blind people. I call it my freedom staff. It will keep me  for example  from making an undignified  departure from the stage.  Laughter  I do see that cliff edge. They warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap has occurred to speakers up here on the stage. I don't care to set a new precedent. But beyond that  many of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage    with my tongue. Those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me  just like a bat's sonar  and return to me with patterns   with pieces of information  much as light does for you. And my brain  thanks to my parents  has been activated to form images in my visual cortex  which we now call the imaging system  from those patterns of information  much as your brain does. I call this process flash sonar. It is how I have learned to see through my blindness  to navigate my journey through the dark unknowns of my own challenges  which has earned me the moniker  the remarkable Batman.  Now  Batman I will accept. Bats are cool. Batman is cool. But I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable. I have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges. Is that so remarkable  I do not use my eyes  I use my brain. Now  someone  somewhere  must think that's remarkable  or I wouldn't be up here  but let's consider this for a moment. Everyone out there who faces or who has ever faced a challenge  raise your hands. Whoosh. Okay. Lots of hands going up  a moment  let me do a head count. This will take a while.  Clicking   Laughter  Okay  lots of hands in the air. Keep them up. I have an idea. Those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges  put your hands down. Okay  anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own.  Laughter  So we all face challenges  and we all face the dark unknown  which is endemic to most challenges  which is what most of us fear  okay  But we all have brains that allow us  that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay  Case in point  I came up here and     Clicking     they wouldn't tell me where the lectern was. So you can't trust those TED folks.  Find it yourself   they said. So     Laughter  And the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all. So now I present to you a challenge. So if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment  okay  And you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar. I'm going to make a sound. I'm going to hold this panel in front  of me  but I'm not going to move it. Just listen to the sound for a moment. Shhhhhhhhhh. Okay  nothing very interesting. Now  listen to what happens to that same exact sound when I move the panel. Shhhhhhhhhhh.   Pitch getting higher and lower  You do not know the power of the dark side. I couldn't resist. Okay  now keep your eyes closed because  did you hear the difference  Okay. Now  let's be sure. For your challenge  you tell me  just say  now  when you hear the panel start to move. Okay  We'll relax into this. Shhhhhhh. Audience  Now. Daniel Kish  Good. Excellent. Open your eyes. All right. So just a few centimeters  you would notice the difference. You've experienced sonar. You'd all make great blind people.  Laughter  Let's have a look at what can happen when this activation process is given some time and attention. and we can see with our ears. Brian Bushway  It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less  it's about enjoying it differently. Shawn Marsolais  It goes across. DK  Yeah. SM  And then it's gradually coming back down again. DK  Yes  SM  That's amazing. I can  like  see the car. Holy mother  J. Louchart  I love being blind. If I had the opportunity  honestly  I wouldn't go back to being sighted. JR  The bigger the goal  the more obstacles you'll face  and on the other side of that goal is victory.  In Italian  DK  Now  do these people look terrified  Not so much. We have delivered activation training to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds in nearly    countries. When blind people learn to see  sighted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better  more clearly  with less fear  because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all to navigate any type of challenge  through any form of darkness  to discoveries unimagined when we are activated. I wish you all a most activating journey. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Daniel  my friend. As I know you can see  it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED. Thank you for an extraordinary talk. Just one more question about your world  your inner world that you construct. We think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have  but what's your world like  What do you have that we don't have  DK  Three hundred and sixty degree view  so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me. It works around corners. It works through surfaces. Generally  it's kind of a fuzzy three dimensional geometry. One of my students  who has now become an instructor  when he lost his vision  after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house  conversations  people in the kitchen  people in the bathroom  several floors away  several walls away. He said it was something like having x ray vision. CA  What do you picture that you're in right now  How do you picture this theater  DK  Lots of loudspeakers  quite frankly. It's interesting.  When people make a sound  when they laugh  when they fidget  when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever  I hear everything. I hear every little movement that every single person makes. None of it really escapes my attention  and then  from a sonar perspective  the size of the room  the curvature  of the audience around the stage  it's the height of the room. Like I say  it's all that kind  of three dimensional surface geometry all around me. CA  Well  Daniel  you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way. Thanks so much for that  truly. DK  Thank you. G'day  my name's Kevin. I'm from Australia. I'm here to help. Tonight  I want to talk about a tale of two cities. One of those cities is called Washington  and the other is called Beijing. Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries  it affects all of us in ways  perhaps  we've never thought of  the air we breathe  the water we drink  the fish we eat  the quality of our oceans  the languages we speak in the future  the jobs we have  the political systems we choose  and  of course  the great questions of war and peace. You see that bloke  He's French. His name is Napoleon. A couple of hundred years ago  he made this extraordinary projection   China is a sleeping lion  and when she awakes  the world will shake.  Napoleon got a few things wrong  he got this one absolutely right. Because China is today not just woken up  China has stood up and China is on the march  and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the   st century  You start looking at the numbers  they start to confront you in a big way. It's projected that China will become  by whichever measure    PPP  market exchange rates    the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead. They're already the largest trading nation  already the largest exporting nation  already the largest manufacturing nation  and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. America comes second. So if China does become the world's largest economy  think about this  It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England    George III  not a good friend of Napoleon's    that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non English speaking country  a non Western country  a non liberal democratic country. And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future  then personally  I think you've been smoking something  and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado. So in short  the question we have tonight is  how do we understand this mega change  which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the   st century  It'll affect so many things. It will go to the absolute core. It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently. It's happening in some senses under the radar  as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine  what's going on in the Middle East  what's going on with ISIS  what's going on with ISIL  what's happening with the future of our economies. This is a slow and quiet revolution. And with a mega change comes also a mega challenge  and the mega challenge is this  Can these two great countries  China and the United States    China  the Middle Kingdom  and the United States  M igu     which in Chinese  by the way  means  the beautiful country.  Think about that    that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years. Whether these two great civilizations  these two great countries  can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world  In short  can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous  or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace  And I have    minutes to work through war or peace  which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called  War and Peace.  People ask me  why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese  Well  there are two reasons for that. Here's the first of them. That's Betsy the cow. Now  Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia. See those hands there  These are not built for farming. So very early on  I discovered that in fact  working in a farm was not designed for me  and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life. Here's the second reason. That's my mom. Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do  Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do  I rarely did  but what my mom said to me was  one day  she handed me a newspaper  a headline which said  here we have a huge change. And that change is China entering the United Nations.       I had just turned    years of age  and she handed me this headline. And she said   Understand this   learn this  because it's going to affect your future.  So being a very good student of history  I decided that the best thing for me to do was  in fact  to go off and learn Chinese. The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name. And so they gave me this name  K   which means to overcome or to conquer  and W n  and that's the character for literature or the arts. K  W n  Conqueror of the Classics. Any of you guys called  Kevin   It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics. I've been called Kevin all my life. Have you been called Kevin all your life  Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics  And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service  but here is where pride    before pride  there always comes a fall. So there I am in the embassy in Beijing  off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador  who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People. And so there was I. If you've been to a Chinese meeting  it's a giant horseshoe. At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh bahs  and down the end of the horseshoe are the not so serious pooh bahs  the junior woodchucks like me. And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase. He said   China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness.  And I thought to myself   That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd. I will improve it.  Note to file  Never do that. It needed to be a little more elegant  a little more classical  so I rendered it as follows.  In Chinese  There was a big pause on the other side of the room. You could see the giant pooh bahs at the head of the horseshoe  the blood visibly draining from their faces  and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter. Because when I rendered his sentence   Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness   in fact  what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm. That was the last time I was asked to interpret. But in that little story  there's a wisdom  which is  as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of       years of continuing history  there's always something new to learn. History is against us when it comes to the U.S. and China forging a common future together. This guy up here  He's not Chinese and he's not American. He's Greek. His name's Thucydides. He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars. And he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and Sparta.  It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable.  And hence  a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap. This guy here  He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese. His name is Sun Tzu. He wrote  The Art of War   and if you see his statement underneath  it's along these lines   Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected.  Not looking good so far for China and the United States. This guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison. In fact  he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston. He's working on a single project at the moment  which is  does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China U.S. relations  It's a core question. And what Graham has done is explore    cases in history since the     s to establish what the precedents are. And in    out of    of them  let me tell you  they've ended in catastrophic war. You may say   But Kevin    or Conqueror of the Classics    that was the past. We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization. It could never happen again.  Guess what  The economic historians tell us that in fact  the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in       just before that happened  World War I  a sobering reflection from history. So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks  feels  and positions itself towards the United States  and the reverse  how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together  Let me first go to  in fact  China's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West. Number one  China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history  beginning with the Opium Wars. When after that  the Western powers carved China up into little pieces  so that by the time it got to the '  s and '  s  signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.   No dogs and Chinese allowed   How would you feel if you were Chinese  in your own country   if you saw that sign appear  China also believes and feels as if  in the events of       at the Peace Conference in Paris  when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world  what about German colonies in China  They were  in fact  given to Japan. When Japan then invaded China in the     s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China. And then  on top of that  the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies  and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system. China also believes that it is being contained by U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S. right around its periphery. And beyond all that  the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant. That is  we don't recognize the problems in our own system  in our politics and our economics  and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere  and believe that  in fact  we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy. Of course  in international relations  it's not just the sound of one hand clapping. There's another country too  and that's called the U.S. So how does the U.S. respond to all of the above  The U.S. has a response to each of those. On the question of is the U.S. containing China  they say   No  look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment.  Instead  what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy  and on top of that  welcome them into the World Trade Organization. The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights  and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms. Furthermore  the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights  democracy  and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West. And on top of all the above  what does the United States say  That they fear that China will  when it has sufficient power  establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia  boot the United States out  and in time  when it's powerful enough  unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order. So apart from all of that  it's just fine and dandy  the U.S. China relationship. No real problems there. The challenge  though  is given those deep rooted feelings  those deep rooted emotions and thought patterns  what the Chinese call  S w i   ways of thinking  how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two  I argue simply this  We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose. What do I mean by that  Be realistic about the things that we disagree on  and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them. Be constructive in areas of the bilateral  regional and global engagement between the two  which will make a difference for all of humankind. Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia  an Asia Pacific community. And worldwide  act further  like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart. Of course  all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above. These things are deliverable. But the question is  are they deliverable alone  This is what our head tells us we need to do  but what about our heart  I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who  frankly  haven't had a whole lot in common in the past. And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples. This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government  the Australian parliament  and for the Australian people. After     years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians  it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry. The important thing    The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology. It was extraordinary to see  for example  old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents  like this lady here. It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building  and one woman said to me  it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life  and she was over   . That's a terrible story. And then I remember this family saying to me   You know  we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing  drove our way through redneck country. On the way back  stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake.  And they walked into this cafe quietly  tentatively  gingerly  a little anxious. I think you know what I'm talking about. But the day after the apology  what happened  Everyone in that cafe  every one of the white folks  stood up and applauded. Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia. The white folks  our Aboriginal brothers and sisters  and we haven't solved all these problems together  but let me tell you  there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head  we'd gone also to the heart. So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening  which is the future of U.S. China relations  The head says there's a way forward. The head says there is a policy framework  there's a common narrative  there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better. But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America China relationship  and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world. Sometimes  folks  we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land. In China  they now talk about the Chinese Dream. In America  we're all familiar with the term  the American Dream.  I think it's time  across the world  that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind. Because if we do that  we might just change the way that we think about each other.  In Chinese  That's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China. That's my challenge to all of us  but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war. I thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that. It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging. You  in a way  are uniquely placed to speak to both sides. Kevin Rudd  Well  what we Australians do best is organize the drinks  so you get them together in one room  and we suggest this and suggest that  then we go and get the drinks. But no  look  for all of us who are friends of these two great countries  America and China  you can do something. You can make a practical contribution  and for all you good folks here  next time you meet someone from China  sit down and have a conversation. See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think  and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same. Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference. Those of us up the middle  we can make a small contribution. CA  Kevin  all power to you  my friend. Thank you. KR  Thank you. Thank you  folks. People back home call me a heckler  a troublemaker  an irritant  a rebel  an activist  the voice of the people. But that wasn't always me. Growing up  I had a nickname. They used to call me Softy  meaning the soft  harmless boy. Like every other human being  I avoided trouble. In my childhood  they taught me silence. Don't argue  do as you're told. In Sunday school  they taught me don't confront  don't argue  even if you're right  turn the other cheek. This was reinforced by the political climate of the time. Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich. Kenya's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals. This was reinforced by the political climate of the day. We had a president  Moi  who was a dictator. He ruled the country with an iron fist  and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested  tortured  jailed or even killed. That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards  stay out of trouble. Being a coward was not an insult. Being a coward was a compliment. We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother. What that meant  that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive. I used to question this advice  and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya  and the results were violently disputed. What followed that election was terrible violence  rape  and the killing of over       people. My work was to document the violence. As a photographer  I took thousands of images  and after two months  the two politicians came together  had a cup of tea  signed a peace agreement  and the country moved on. I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand. I saw the killings. I saw the displacement. I met women who had been raped  and it disturbed me  but the country never spoke about it. We pretended. We all became smart cowards. We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it. Ten months later  I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore. After quitting my job  I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country  to speak about the state of the nation  and June         was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention. It's a national holiday  it's broadcast across the country  and I showed up at the stadium. My friends did not show up. I found myself alone  and I didn't know what to do. I was scared  but I knew very well that that particular day  I had to make a decision. Was I able to live as a coward  like everyone else  or was I going to make a stand  And when the president stood up to speak  I found myself on my feet shouting at the president  telling him to remember the post election violence victims  to stop the corruption. And suddenly  out of nowhere  the police pounced on me like hungry lions. They held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium  where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail. I spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail  and that got me thinking. What was making me feel this way  My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did  and the images that I took were disturbing my life. The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans. Most Kenyans did not see the violence. It was a story to them. And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it. We traveled the country and showed the images  and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path  where I decided to become silent no more  to talk about those things. We traveled  and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country  talking about corruption  bad leadership. We have even done symbolic burials. We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament as a symbol of our politicians' greed. It has been done in Uganda and other countries  and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country  across the continent. Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago  now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me. I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things. I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country  who want to bring about change  and they're no longer afraid  and they're no longer smart cowards. So that was my story. That day in the stadium  I stood up as a smart coward. By that one action  I said goodbye to the    years living as a coward. There are two most powerful days in your life  the day you're born  and the day you discover why. That day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President  I discovered why I was truly born  that I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice. Do you know why you were born  Thank you. Tom Rielly  It's an amazing story. I just want to ask you a couple quick questions. So PAWA     you've created a studio  a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action. What's happening now with PAWA  Boniface Mwangi  So we have  this community of filmmakers  graffiti artists  musicians  and when there's an issue in the country  we come together  we brainstorm  and take up on that issue. So our most powerful tool is art  because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life  and they don't have time to read. So we package our activism and we package our message in art. So from the music  the graffiti   the art  that's what we do. Can I say one more thing  TR  Yeah  of course.  Applause  BM  In spite of being arrested  beaten up  threatened  the moment I discovered my voice  that I could actually stand up for what I really believed in  I'm no longer afraid. I used to be called softy  but I'm no longer softy  because I discovered who I really am  as in  that's what I want to do  and there's such beauty in doing that. There's nothing as powerful as that  knowing that I'm meant to do this  because you don't get scared  you just continue living your life. Thank you. When I was a kid  the disaster we worried about most  was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement  filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came  we were supposed to go downstairs  hunker down  and eat out of that barrel. Today the greatest risk  of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead  it looks like this. If anything kills over    million people in the next few decades  it's most likely to be  a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles  but microbes. Now  part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little  in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it  in the newspaper  lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully  through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on  the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough  the problem was that we  didn't have a system at all. In fact  there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists  ready to go  who would have gone  seen what the disease was  seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people. Now  M decins Sans Fronti res  did a great job orchestrating volunteers. But even so  we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there  to look at treatment approaches. No one to look at the diagnostics. No one to figure out  what tools should be used. As an example  we could have  taken the blood of survivors  processed it  and put that plasma back in people to protect them. But that was never tried. So there was a lot that was missing. And these things  are really a global failure. The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics  but not to do these things I talked about. Now  in the movies it's quite different. There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go  they move in  they save the day  but that's just pure Hollywood. The failure to prepare  could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically  more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression  of Ebola over this year. About        people died  and nearly all were in the three West African countries. There's three reasons why it didn't spread more. The first is that there was a lot  of heroic work by the health workers. They found the people and they  prevented more infections. The second is the nature of the virus. Ebola does not spread through the air. And by the time you're contagious  most people are so sick  that they're bedridden. Third  it didn't get into many urban areas. And that was just luck. If it had gotten into a lot  more urban areas  the case numbers  would have been much larger. So next time  we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people  feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be  a natural epidemic like Ebola  or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse. In fact  let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air  like the Spanish Flu back in     . So here's what would happen  It would spread throughout the world very  very quickly. And you can see over    million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned. But in fact  we can build a really good response system. We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here. We've got cell phones to get information from the public  and get information out to them. We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving. We have advances in biology that should dramatically change  the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen. So we can have tools  but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system. And we need preparedness. The best lessons  I think   on how to get prepared are again  what we do for war. For soldiers  we have full time  waiting to go. We have reserves that can scale  us up to large numbers. NATO has a mobile unit  that can deploy very rapidly. NATO does a lot of war games  to check  are people well trained  Do they understand  about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies  So they are absolutely ready to go. So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic. What are the key pieces  First  we need strong health systems in poor countries. That's where mothers  can give birth safely  kids can get all their vaccines. But  also where we'll see  the outbreak very early on. We need a medical reserve corps  lots of people who've got  the training and background who are ready to go  with the expertise. And then we need to pair those medical people with the military. taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast  do logistics and secure areas. We need to do simulations  germ games  not war games  so that we see where the holes are. The last time a germ game  was done in the United States was back in        and it didn't go so well. So far the score is germs     people   . Finally  we need lots of advanced R D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics. There are some big breakthroughs   like the Adeno associated virus  that could work very  very quickly. Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost  but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm. The World Bank estimates that  if we have a worldwide flu epidemic  global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths. These investments  offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic. The primary healthcare  the R D  those things would reduce  global health equity and make the world more just  as well as more safe. So I think this should absolutely be a priority. There's no need to panic. We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement. But we need to get going  because time is not on our side. In fact  if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic  it's that it can serve as an early  warning  a wake up call  to get ready. If we start now  we can be ready  for the next epidemic. Thank you. I dedicated the past two years  to understanding how people achieve their dreams. When we think about the dreams we have  and the dent we want to leave in the universe  it is striking to see how big  of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have  and projects that never happen. So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not  to follow your dreams. One  Believe in overnight success. You know the story  right  The tech guy built a mobile app  and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know  the story may seem real  but I bet it's incomplete. If you go investigate further  the guy has done    apps before and he has done a master's on the topic  a Ph.D. He has been working on the topic for    years. This is really interesting  I myself have a story in Brazil  that people think is an overnight success. I come from a humble family  and two weeks before  the deadline to apply to MIT  I started the application process. And  voila  I got in. People may think it's  an overnight success  but that only worked because  for the    years prior to that  I took life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your  life through that moment. Two  Believe someone else  has the answers for you. Constantly  people want  to help out  right  All sorts of people  your family  your friends  your business partners  they all have opinions  on which path you should take   And let me tell you   go through this pipe.  But whenever you go inside  there are  other ways you have to pick as well. And you need to make  those decisions yourself. No one else has the perfect answers for your life. And you need to keep picking those decisions  right  The pipes are infinite and  you're going to bump your head  and it's a part of the process. Three  and it's very subtle  but very important  Decide to settle when  growth is guaranteed. So when your life is going great  you have put together a great team  and you have growing revenue  and everything is set    time to settle. When I launched my first book  I worked really  really hard to  distribute it everywhere in Brazil. With that  over three million  people downloaded it  over        people  bought physical copies. When I wrote a sequel   some impact was guaranteed. Even if I did little  sales would be okay. But okay is never okay. When you're growing towards a peak  you need to work harder than ever  and find yourself another peak. Maybe if I did little  a couple hundred thousand people would read it  and that's great already. But if I work harder than ever  I can bring this number up to millions. That's why I decided  with my new book  to go to every single state of Brazil. And I can already see a higher peak. There's no time to settle down. Fourth tip  and that's really important  Believe the fault is someone else's. I constantly see people saying   Yes  I had this great idea  but no investor had the vision to invest.   Oh  I created this great product  but the market is so bad  the sales didn't go well.  Or   I can't find good talent  my team is so below expectations.  If you have dreams  it's your responsibility  to make them happen. Yes  it may be hard to find talent. Yes  the market may be bad. But if no one invested in your idea  if no one bought your product  for sure  there is something  there that is your fault. Definitely. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn't make them happen   it's your fault and no one else's. Be responsible for your dreams. And one last tip  and this one is  really important as well  Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Once I saw an ad   and it was a lot of friends  they were going up a mountain  it was a very high mountain  and it was a lot of work. You could see that they  were sweating and this was tough. And they were going up   and they finally made it to the peak. Of course  they decided to celebrate  right  I'm going to celebrate  so   Yes  We made it  we're at the top   Two seconds later  one looks at the other and says   Okay  let's go down.  Life is never about the goals themselves. Life is about the journey. Yes  you should enjoy  the goals themselves  but people think that you have dreams  and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams  it's a magical place where  happiness will be all around. But achieving a dream  is a momentary sensation  and your life is not. The only way to really achieve  all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step  of your journey. That's the best way. And your journey is simple    it's made of steps. Some steps will be right on. Sometimes you will trip. If it's right on  celebrate  because some people wait a lot to celebrate. And if you tripped  turn that into something to learn. If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate  you will for sure enjoy the journey. So  five tips  Believe in overnight success  believe someone else  has the answers for you  believe that when growth is guaranteed   you should settle down  believe the fault is someone else's  and believe that only  the goals themselves matter. Believe me  if you do that   you will destroy your dreams. Thank you. Imagine you're in a bar  or a club  and you start talking  and after a while  the question comes up   So  what do you do for work   And since you think your job is interesting  you say   I'm a mathematician.   Laughter  And inevitably  during that conversation one of these two phrases come up  A   I was terrible at math  but it wasn't my fault. It's because the teacher was awful.   Laughter  Or B   But what is math really for   I'll now address Case B. When someone asks you what math is for  they're not asking you about applications of mathematical science. They're asking you  why did I have to study that bullshit I never used in my life again   Laughter  That's what they're actually asking. So when mathematicians are asked what math is for  they tend to fall into two groups    .   percent of mathematicians will assume an attacking position  and   .   percent of mathematicians will take a defensive position. There's a strange  .  percent  among which I include myself. Who are the ones that attack  The attacking ones are mathematicians who would tell you this question makes no sense  because mathematics have a meaning all their own    a beautiful edifice with its own logic    and that there's no point in constantly searching for all possible applications. What's the use of poetry  What's the use of love  What's the use of life itself   What kind of question is that  Hardy  for instance  was a model of this type of attack. And those who stand in defense tell you   Even if you don't realize it  friend  math is behind everything.  Those guys  they always bring up bridges and computers.  If you don't know math  your bridge will collapse.  It's true  computers are all about math. And now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers. These are the answers your math teacher would give you if you asked him. He's one of the defensive ones. Okay  but who's right then  Those who say that math doesn't need to have a purpose  or those who say that math is behind everything we do  Actually  both are right. But remember I told you I belong to that strange  .  percent claiming something else  So  go ahead  ask me what math is for. Audience  What is math for  Eduardo S enz de Cabez n  Okay    .   percent of you asked the question    .   percent didn't say anything  and the  .  percent    I'm not sure what those guys are doing. Well  to my dear   .   percent    it's true that math doesn't need to serve a purpose  it's true that it's a beautiful structure  a logical one  probably one of the greatest collective efforts ever achieved in human history. But it's also true that there  where scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories that allow them to advance  they're within the structure of math  which permeates everything. It's true that we have to go somewhat deeper  to see what's behind science. Science operates on intuition  creativity. Math controls intuition and tames creativity. Almost everyone who hasn't heard this before is surprised when they hear that if you take a  .  millimeter thick sheet of paper  the size we normally use  and  if it were big enough  fold it    times  its thickness would extend almost the distance from the Earth to the sun. Your intuition tells you it's impossible. Do the math and you'll see it's right. That's what math is for. It's true that science  all types of science  only makes sense because it makes us better understand this beautiful world we live in. And in doing that  it helps us avoid the pitfalls of this painful world we live in. There are sciences that help us in this way quite directly. Oncological science  for example. And there are others we look at from afar  with envy sometimes  but knowing that we are what supports them. All the basic sciences support them  including math. All that makes science  science is the rigor of math. And that rigor factors in because its results are eternal. You probably said or were told at some point that diamonds are forever  right  That depends on your definition of forever  A theorem    that really is forever. The Pythagorean theorem is still true even though Pythagoras is dead  I assure you it's true.  Laughter  Even if the world collapsed the Pythagorean theorem would still be true. Wherever any two triangle sides and a good hypotenuse get together the Pythagorean theorem goes all out. It works like crazy. Well  we mathematicians devote ourselves to come up with theorems. Eternal truths. But it isn't always easy to know the difference between an eternal truth  or theorem  and a mere conjecture. You need proof. For example  let's say I have a big  enormous  infinite field. I want to cover it with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps. I could use squares  right  I could use triangles. Not circles  those leave little gaps. Which is the best shape to use  One that covers the same surface  but has a smaller border. In the year      Pappus of Alexandria said the best is to use hexagons  just like bees do. But he didn't prove it. The guy said   Hexagons  great  Let's go with hexagons   He didn't prove it  it remained a conjecture.  Hexagons   And the world  as you know  split into Pappists and anti Pappists  until      years later when in       Thomas Hales proved that Pappus and the bees were right    the best shape to use was the hexagon. And that became a theorem  the honeycomb theorem  that will be true forever and ever  for longer than any diamond you may have.  Laughter  But what happens if we go to three dimensions  If I want to fill the space with equal pieces  without leaving any gaps  I can use cubes  right  Not spheres  those leave little gaps.  Laughter  What is the best shape to use  Lord Kelvin  of the famous Kelvin degrees and all  said that the best was to use a truncated octahedron which  as you all know    is this thing here  Come on. Who doesn't have a truncated octahedron at home   Laughter  Even a plastic one.  Honey  get the truncated octahedron  we're having guests.  Everybody has one   Laughter  But Kelvin didn't prove it. It remained a conjecture    Kelvin's conjecture. The world  as you know  then split into Kelvinists and anti Kelvinists until a hundred or so years later  someone found a better structure. Weaire and Phelan found this little thing over here    this structure to which they gave the very clever name  the Weaire   Phelan structure.  It looks like a strange object  but it isn't so strange  it also exists in nature. It's very interesting that this structure  because of its geometric properties  was used to build the Aquatics Center for the Beijing Olympic Games. There  Michael Phelps won eight gold medals  and became the best swimmer of all time. Well  until someone better comes along  right  As may happen with the Weaire   Phelan structure. It's the best until something better shows up. But be careful  because this one really stands a chance that in a hundred or so years  or even if it's in      years  that someone proves it's the best possible shape for the job. It will then become a theorem  a truth  forever and ever. For longer than any diamond. So  if you want to tell someone that you will love them forever you can give them a diamond. But if you want to tell them that you'll love them forever and ever  give them a theorem  But hang on a minute  You'll have to prove it  so your love doesn't remain a conjecture. It would be nice to be objective in life  in many ways. The problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations. For example  think about something as simple as beer. If I gave you a few beers to taste and I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness  different beers would occupy different space. But what if we tried to be objective about it  In the case of beer  it would be very simple. What if we did a blind taste  Well  if we did the same thing  you tasted the same beer  now in the blind taste  things would look slightly different. Most of the beers will go into one place. You will basically not be able to distinguish them  and the exception  of course  will be Guinness. Similarly  we can think about physiology. What happens when people expect something from their physiology  For example  we sold people pain medications. Some people  we told them the medications were expensive. Some people  we told them it was cheap. And the expensive pain medication worked better. It relieved more pain from people  because expectations do change our physiology. And of course  we all know that in sports  if you are a fan of a particular team  you can't help but see the game develop from the perspective of your team. So all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations color our world. But what happened in more important questions  What happened with questions that had to do with social justice  So we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality  So we started looking at inequality  and we did some large scale surveys around the U.S. and other countries. So we asked two questions  Do people know what kind of level of inequality we have  And then  what level of inequality do we want to have  So let's think about the first question. Imagine I took all the people in the U.S. and I sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left  and then I divided them into five buckets  the poorest    percent  the next    percent  the next  the next  and the richest    percent. And then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets. So to make it simpler  imagine I ask you to tell me  how much wealth do you think is concentrated in the bottom two buckets  the bottom    percent  Take a second. Think about it and have a number. Usually we don't think. Think for a second  have a real number in your mind. You have it  Okay  here's what lots of Americans tell us. They think that the bottom    percent has about  .  percent of the wealth  the next group has  .   so together it's slightly more than nine. The next group  they say  has    percent     percent  and the richest    percent  people think has    percent of the wealth. You can see how this relates to what you thought. Now  what's reality  Reality is slightly different. The bottom    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. The next    percent has  .  percent of the wealth. Together  it's  . . The next group has  .     .   and the richest group has       percent of the wealth. So what we actually have and what we think we have are very different. What about what we want  How do we even figure this out  So to look at this  to look at what we really want  we thought about the philosopher John Rawls. If you remember John Rawls  he had this notion of what's a just society. He said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it  you would be willing to enter it in a random place. And it's a beautiful definition  because if you're wealthy  you might want the wealthy to have more money  the poor to have less. If you're poor  you might want more equality. But if you're going to go into that society in every possible situation  and you don't know  you have to consider all the aspects. It's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision  and Rawls called this the  veil of ignorance.  So  we took another group  a large group of Americans  and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance. What are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it  knowing that you could end randomly at any place  And here is what we got. What did people want to give to the first group  the bottom    percent  They wanted to give them about    percent of the wealth. The next group     percent of the wealth         and   . Now  nobody in our sample wanted full equality. Nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample. But what does it mean  It means that we have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have  but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right to what we think we have. Now  we can ask these questions  by the way  not just about wealth. We can ask it about other things as well. So for example  we asked people from different parts of the world about this question  people who are liberals and conservatives  and they gave us basically  the same answer. We asked rich and poor  they gave us the same answer  men and women  NPR listeners and Forbes readers. We asked people in England  Australia  the U.S.    very similar answers. We even asked different departments of a university. We went to Harvard and we checked almost every department  and in fact  from Harvard Business School  where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the  poor  to have less  the similarity was astonishing. I know some of you went to Harvard Business School. We also asked this question about something else. We asked  what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers  So you can see what people think is the ratio  and then we can ask the question  what do they think should be the ratio  And then we can ask  what is reality  What is reality  And you could say  well  it's not that bad  right  The red and the yellow are not that different. But the fact is  it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale. It's hard to see  there's yellow and blue in there. So what about other outcomes of wealth  Wealth is not just about wealth. We asked  what about things like health  What about availability of prescription medication  What about life expectancy  What about life expectancy of infants  How do we want this to be distributed  What about education for young people  And for older people  And across all of those things  what we learned was that people don't like inequality of wealth  but there's other things where inequality  which is an outcome of wealth  is even more aversive to them  for example  inequality in health or education. We also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency    basically  young kids and babies  because we don't think of them as responsible for their situation. So what are some lessons from this  We have two gaps  We have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap And the knowledge gap is something that we think about  how do we educate people  How do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health  education  jealousy  crime rate  and so on  Then we have the desirability gap. How do we get people to think differently about what we really want  You see  the Rawls definition  the Rawls way of looking at the world  the blind tasting approach  takes our selfish motivation out of the picture. How do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive scale  And finally  we also have an action gap. How do we take these things and actually do something about it  I think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don't have much agency  because people seem to be more willing to do this. To summarize  I would say  next time you go to drink beer or wine  first of all  think about  what is it in your experience that is real  and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations  And then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life  and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us. Thanks a lot. I'd like to take you on the epic quest of the Rosetta spacecraft. To escort and land the probe on a comet  this has been my passion for the past two years. In order to do that  I need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system. When we go back four and a half billion years  there was a cloud of gas and dust. In the center of this cloud  our sun formed and ignited. Along with that  what we now know as planets  comets and asteroids formed. What then happened  according to theory  is that when the Earth had cooled down a bit after its formation  comets massively impacted the Earth and delivered water to Earth. They probably also delivered complex organic material to Earth  and that may have bootstrapped the emergence of life. You can compare this to having to solve a     piece puzzle and not a       piece puzzle. Afterwards  the big planets like Jupiter and Saturn  they were not in their place where they are now  and they interacted gravitationally  and they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean  and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the Kuiper Belt  which is a belt of objects beyond the orbit of Neptune. And sometimes these objects run into each other  and they gravitationally deflect  and then the gravity of Jupiter pulls them back into the solar system. And they then become the comets as we see them in the sky. The important thing here to note is that in the meantime  the four and a half billion years  these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system  and haven't changed    deep  frozen versions of our solar system. In the sky  they look like this. We know them for their tails. There are actually two tails. One is a dust tail  which is blown away by the solar wind. The other one is an ion tail  which is charged particles  and they follow the magnetic field in the solar system. There's the coma  and then there is the nucleus  which here is too small to see  and you have to remember that in the case of Rosetta  the spacecraft is in that center pixel. We are only            kilometers away from the comet. So what's important to remember  Comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed  so they're ideal to study the components that were present at the time  when Earth  and life  started. Comets are also suspected of having brought the elements which may have bootstrapped life. In       ESA set up its long term Horizon      program  which contained one cornerstone  which would be a mission to a comet. In parallel  a small mission to a comet  what you see here  Giotto  was launched  and in       flew by the comet of Halley with an armada of other spacecraft. From the results of that mission  it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system. And thus  the Rosetta mission was approved in       and originally it was supposed to be launched in       but a problem arose with an Ariane rocket. However  our P.R. department  in its enthusiasm  had already made       Delft Blue plates with the name of the wrong comets. So I've never had to buy any china since. That's the positive part. Once the whole problem was solved  we left Earth in      to the newly selected comet  Churyumov Gerasimenko. This comet had to be specially selected because A  you have to be able to get to it  and B  it shouldn't have been in the solar system too long. This particular comet has been  in the solar system since     . That's the first time when it was deflected by Jupiter  and it got close enough to the sun to start changing. So it's a very fresh comet. Rosetta made a few historic firsts. It's the first satellite to orbit a comet  and to escort it throughout its whole tour through the solar system    closest approach to the sun  as we will see in August  and then away again to the exterior. It's the first ever landing on a comet. We actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft. Normally  you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are. In this case  that's not enough. We navigated by looking at landmarks on the comet. We recognized features    boulders  craters    and that's how we know where we are respective to the comet. And  of course  it's the first satellite to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter on solar cells. Now  this sounds more heroic than it actually is  because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators wasn't available in Europe at that time  so there was no choice. But these solar arrays are big. This is one wing  and these are not specially selected small people. They're just like you and me. We have two of these wings     square meters. Now later on  of course  when we got to the comet  you find out that    square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing is not always a very handy choice. Now  how did we get to the comet  Because we had to go there for the Rosetta scientific objectives very far away    four times the distance of the Earth to the sun    and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel  because we'd have to take six times as much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed. So what do you do  You use gravitational flybys  slingshots  where you pass by a planet at very low altitude  a few thousand kilometers  and then you get the velocity of that planet around the sun for free. We did that a few times. We did Earth  we did Mars  we did twice Earth again  and we also flew by two asteroids  Lutetia and Steins. Then in       we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble  we couldn't actually save the spacecraft anymore  so we went into hibernation. Everything was switched off except for one clock. Here you see in white the trajectory  and the way this works. You see that from the circle where we started  the white line  actually you get more and more and more elliptical  and then finally we approached the comet in May       and we had to start doing the rendezvous maneuvers. On the way there  we flew by Earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras. This is the moon rising over Earth  and this is what we now call a selfie  which at that time  by the way  that word didn't exist.  Laughter  It's at Mars. It was taken by the CIVA camera. That's one of the cameras on the lander  and it just looks under the solar arrays  and you see the planet Mars and the solar array in the distance. Now  when we got out of hibernation in January       we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in May. However  the velocity the spacecraft had was much too fast. We were going       kilometers an hour faster than the comet  so we had to brake. We had to do eight maneuvers  and you see here  some of them were really big. We had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers per hour  and actually  the duration of that was seven hours  and it used     kilos of fuel  and those were seven nerve wracking  hours  because in       there was a leak in the system of the propulsion of Rosetta  and we had to close off a branch  so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for. Then we got in the vicinity of the comet  and these were the first pictures we saw. The true comet rotation period is    and a half hours  so this is accelerated  but you will understand that our flight dynamics engineers thought  this is not going to be an easy thing to land on. We had hoped for some kind of spud like thing where you could easily land. But we had one hope  maybe it was smooth. No. That didn't work either.  Laughter  So at that point in time  it was clearly unavoidable  we had to map this body in all the detail you could get  because we had to find an area which is     meters in diameter and flat. Why     meters  That's the error we have on landing the probe. So we went through this process  and we mapped the comet. We used a technique called photoclinometry. You use shadows thrown by the sun. What you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet  and the sun shines from above. From the shadow  we  with our brain  can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is. You can program that in a computer  you then cover the whole comet  and you can map the comet. For that  we flew special trajectories starting in August. First  a triangle of     kilometers on a side at     kilometers' distance  and we repeated the whole  thing at    kilometers. At that time  we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles  and we could use this technique to map the whole thing. Now  this led to a selection of landing sites. This whole process we had to do  to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site  was    days. We didn't have more. To give you an idea  the average Mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go  We had    days  and that was it. We finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for Rosetta to launch Philae. The way this works is that Rosetta has to be at the right point in space  and aiming towards the comet  because the lander is passive. The lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet. Rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look at Philae while it was departing and to be able to communicate with it. Now  the landing duration of the whole trajectory was seven hours. Now do a simple calculation  if the velocity of Rosetta is off by one centimeter per second  seven hours is        seconds. That means     meters wrong on the comet. So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta much better than one centimeter per second  and its location in space better than     meters at     million kilometers from Earth. That's no mean feat. Let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments. I won't bore you with all the details of all the instruments  but it's got everything. We can sniff gas  we can measure dust particles  the shape of them  the composition  there are magnetometers  everything. This is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of Rosetta  so it's gas which has left the comet. The bottom graph is September of last year. There is a long term variation  which in itself is not surprising  but you see the sharp peaks. This is a comet day. You can see the effect of the sun on the evaporation of gas and the fact that the comet is rotating. So there is one spot  apparently  where there is a lot of stuff coming from  it gets heated in the Sun  and then cools down on the back side. And we can see the density variations of this. These are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured. You will see it's an impressive list  and there is much  much  much more to come  because there are more measurements. Actually  there is a conference going on in Houston at the moment where many of these results are presented. Also  we measured dust particles. Now  for you  this will not look very impressive  but the scientists were thrilled when they saw this. Two dust particles  the right one they call Boris  and they shot it with tantalum in order to be able to analyze it. Now  we found sodium and magnesium. What this tells you is this is the concentration of these two materials at the time the solar system was formed  so we learned things about which materials were there when the planet was made. Of course  one of the important elements is the imaging. This is one of the cameras of Rosetta  the OSIRIS camera  and this actually was the cover of Science magazine on January    of this year. Nobody had expected this body to look like this. Boulders  rocks    if anything  it looks more like the Half Dome in Yosemite than anything else. We also saw things like this  dunes  and what look to be  on the righthand side  wind blown shadows. Now we know these from Mars  but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere  so it's a bit difficult to create a wind blown shadow. It may be local outgassing  stuff which goes up and comes back. We don't know  so there is a lot to investigate. Here  you see the same image twice. On the left hand side  you see in the middle a pit. On the right hand side  if you carefully look  there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit. So this is the activity of the comet. Apparently  at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are  and where the material evaporates into space. There is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet. You see it on the right hand side. It's a kilometer long  and it's two and a half meters wide. Some people suggest that actually  when we get close to the sun  the comet may split in two  and then we'll have to choose  which comet do we go for  The lander    again  lots of instruments  mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill  etc. But much the same as Rosetta  and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what you find on the comet. These are called ground truth measurements. These are the landing descent images that were taken by the OSIRIS camera. You see the lander getting further and further away from Rosetta. On the top right  you see an image taken at    meters by the lander     meters above the surface of the comet. The boulder there is some    meters. So this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet. Here  you see the whole sequence again  but from a different perspective  and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet. Then  at the top  there is a before and an after image of the landing. The only problem with the after image is  there is no lander. But if you carefully look at the right hand side of this image  we saw the lander still there   but it had bounced. It had departed again. Now  on a bit of a comical note here is that originally Rosetta was designed to have a lander which would bounce. That was discarded because it was way too expensive. Now  we forgot  but the lander knew. During the first bounce  in the magnetometers  you see here the data from them  from the three axes  x  y and z. Halfway through  you see a red line. At that red line  there is a change. What happened  apparently  is during the first bounce  somewhere  we hit the edge of a crater with one of the legs of the lander  and the rotation velocity of the lander changed. So we've been rather lucky that we are where we are. This is one of the iconic images of Rosetta. It's a man made object  a leg of the lander  standing on a comet. This  for me  is one of the very best images of space science I have ever seen. One of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander. The blue area here is where we know it must be. We haven't been able to find it yet  but the search is continuing  as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again. We listen every day  and we hope that between now and somewhere in April  the lander will wake up again. The findings of what we found on the comet  This thing would float in water. It's half the density of water. So it looks like a very big rock  but it's not. The activity increase we saw in June  July  August last year was a four fold activity increase. By the time we will be at the sun  there will be     kilos a second leaving this comet  gas  dust  whatever. That's     million kilos a day. Then  finally  the landing day. I will never forget    absolute madness      TV crews in Germany. The BBC was interviewing me  and another TV crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed  and it went on like that for the whole day. The Discovery Channel crew actually caught me when leaving the control room  and they asked the right question  and man  I got into tears  and I still feel this. For a month and a half  I couldn't think about landing day without crying  and I still have the emotion in me. With this image of the comet  I would like to leave you. Thank you. I am a Hazara  and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan. Like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids  I was born in exile. The ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras forced my parents to leave Afghanistan. This persecution has had a long history going back to the late     s  and the rule of King Abdur Rahman. He killed    percent of  the Hazara population. He built minarets with their heads. Many Hazaras were sold into slavery  and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan. My parents also fled to Pakistan  and settled in Quetta  where I was born. After the September    attack on the Twin Towers  I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time  with foreign journalists. I was only     and I got a job working as an interpreter. After four years  I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently  and I was working there as a documentary photographer  and I worked on many stories. One of the most important stories that I did was the dancing boys of Afghanistan. It is a tragic story about an appalling tradition. It involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society. These boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents  and they are put to work as sex slaves. This is Shukur. He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord. He was taken to another province  where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends. When this story was published in the Washington Post  I started receiving death threats  and I was forced to leave Afghanistan  as my parents were. Along with my family  I returned back to Quetta. The situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in     . Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras  it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan. Hazaras are confined into two small areas  and they are marginalized socially  educationally  and financially. This is Nadir. I had known him since my childhood. He was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta. He later died of his injuries. Around       Hazara members had been killed in various attacks  and around       of them were injured  and many of them permanently disabled. The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse  so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee. After Afghanistan  Iran  Pakistan  Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world. When it came time to leave Pakistan  Australia seemed the obvious choice. Financially  only one of us could leave  and it was decided that I would go  in the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely  I could work to get the rest of my family to join me later. We all knew about the risks  and how terrifying the journey is  and I met many people who lost loved ones at sea. It was a desperate decision to take  to leave everything behind  and no one makes this decision easily. If I had been able to simply fly to Australia  it would have taken me less than    hours. But getting a visa was impossible. My journey was much longer  much more complicated  and certainly more dangerous  traveling to Thailand by air  and then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia  paying people and smugglers all the way and spending a lot of time hiding and a lot of time in fear of being caught. In Indonesia  I joined a group of seven asylum seekers. We all shared a bedroom in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor. After spending a week in Bogor  three of my roommates left for the perilous journey  and we got the news two days later that a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island. We found out that our three roommates    Nawroz  Jaffar and Shabbir    were also among those. Only Jaffar was rescued. Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again. It made me think  am I doing the right thing  I concluded I really had no other choice but to go on. A few weeks later  we got the call from the people smuggler to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey. Taken in the night towards the main vessel on a motorboat  we boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded. There were    of us  and we were all below deck. No one was allowed up on the top. We all paid       dollars each for this part of the trip. The first night and day went smoothly  but by the second night   the weather turned. Waves tossed the boat around  and the timbers groaned. People below deck were crying  praying  recalling their loved ones. They were screaming. It was a terrible moment. It was like a scene from doomsday  or maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies that shows that everything is breaking apart and the world is just ending. It was happening to us for real. We didn't have any hope. Our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control. The waves were much higher than our boat  and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out. We all lost hope. We thought  this is the end. We were watching our deaths  and I was documenting it. The captain told us that we are not going to make it  we have to turn back the boat. We went on the deck and turned our torches on and off to attract the attention of any passing boat. We kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling. Eventually  we made it to a small island. Our boat crashing onto the rocks  I slipped into the water and destroyed my camera  whatever I had documented. But luckily  the memory card survived. It was a thick forest. We all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next. We were all scared and confused. Then  after spending the night on the beach  we found a jetty and coconuts. We hailed a boat from a nearby resort  and then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police. At Serang Detention Center  an immigration officer came and furtively strip searched us. He took our mobile  my      cash  our shoes that we should not be able to escape  but we kept watching the guards  checking their movements  and around   a.m. when they sat around a fire  we removed two glass layers from an outside facing window and slipped through. We climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass. We put the pillow on that and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets and climbed the wall  and we ran away with bare feet. I was free  with an uncertain future  no money. The only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage. When my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline  many of my friends came to know about my situation  and they tried to help me. They did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life. I also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR  but I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia for many years doing nothing and unable to work  like every other asylum seeker. But it had happened to be a little bit different with me. I was lucky. My contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR  and I got resettled in Australia in May     . Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me. It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate  in limbo. The issue of asylum seekers in Australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human face. The asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people. I hope my story and the story of other Hazaras could shed some light to show the people how these people are suffering in their countries of origin  and how they suffer  why they risk their lives to seek asylum. Thank you. Today  I am going to talk about anger. When I was     seeing some of my friends  leaving the school because their parents  could not afford textbooks made me angry. When I was     hearing the plight of a desperate slave father whose daughter was  about to be sold to a brothel made me angry. At the age of     lying on the street  in a pool of blood  along with my own son  made me angry. Dear friends  for centuries we were taught anger is bad. Our parents  teachers  priests    everyone taught us how to control  and suppress our anger. But I ask why  Why can't we convert our anger for the larger good of society  Why can't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world  That I tried to do. Friends  most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger. Like when I was    and sat  in a locked up  tiny prison. The whole night  I was angry. But it has given birth to a new idea. But I will come to that later on. Let me begin with the story of how I got a name for myself. I had been a big admirer  of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood. Gandhi fought and lead  India's freedom movement. But more importantly  he taught us how to treat  the most vulnerable sections  the most deprived people   with dignity and respect. And so  when India was celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's  birth centenary in         at that time I was       an idea came to my mind. Why can't we celebrate it differently  I knew  as perhaps many of you might know  that in India  a large number of people are born in the lowest segment of caste. And they are treated as untouchables. These are the people    forget about allowing them  to go to the temples  they cannot even go into the houses  and shops of high caste people. So I was very impressed with  the leaders of my town who were speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of Gandhian ideals. So inspired by that  I thought  let us set an example by inviting these people to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community. I went to some low caste  so called untouchable  people  tried to convince them  but it was unthinkable for them. They told me   No  no. It's not possible. It never happened.  I said   Look at these leaders  they are so great   they are against untouchability. They will come. If nobody comes   we can set an example.  These people thought that I was too naive. Finally  they were convinced. My friends and I took our bicycles and invited political leaders. And I was so thrilled  rather  empowered to see that each one of them  agreed to come. I thought   Great idea. We can set an example. We can bring about change in the society.  The day has come. All these untouchables  three women and two men  they agreed to come. I could recall that they had used  the best of their clothes. They brought new utensils. They had taken baths  hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do. It was the moment of change. They gathered. Food was cooked. It was   o'clock. By   o'clock  we kept on waiting  because it's not very uncommon  that the leaders become late  for an hour or so. So after   o'clock  we took our bicycles and went to these leaders' homes  just to remind them. One of the leader's wives told me   Sorry  he is having some headache  perhaps he cannot come.  I went to another leader and his wife told me    Okay  you go  he will definitely join.  So I thought that the dinner will take place  though not at that large a scale. I went back to the venue  which was a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park. It was    o'clock. None of the leaders showed up. That made me angry. I was standing  leaning against Mahatma Gandhi's statue. I was emotionally drained  rather exhausted. Then I sat down where  the food was lying. I kept my emotions on hold. But then  when I took the first bite  I broke down in tears. And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. And it was the healing  motherly touch  of an untouchable woman. And she told me   Kailash  why are you crying  You have done your bit. You have eaten the food cooked by untouchables  which has never happened in our memory.  She said   You won today.  And my friends  she was right. I came back home  a little after midnight  shocked to see that several  high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard. I saw my mother and  elderly women were crying and they were pleading  to these elderly people because they had threatened  to outcaste my whole family. And you know  outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of. Somehow they agreed to punish only me  and the punishment was purification. That means I had to go     miles away from my hometown to the River Ganges to take a holy dip. And after that  I should organize a feast for priests      priests  wash their feet and drink that water. It was total nonsense  and I refused to accept that punishment. How did they punish me  I was barred from entering into my own  kitchen and my own dining room  my utensils were separated. But the night when I was angry  they wanted to outcaste me. But I decided to outcaste  the entire caste system. And that was possible because the beginning would have been to change the family name  or surname  because in India  most of the family names are caste names. So I decided to drop my name. And then  later on  I gave  a new name to myself  Satyarthi  that means   seeker of truth.  And that was the beginning  of my transformative anger. Friends  maybe one of you can tell me  what was I doing before becoming a children's rights activist  Does anybody know  No. I was an engineer  an electrical engineer. And then I learned how the energy of burning fire  coal  the nuclear blast inside the chambers  raging river currents  fierce winds  could be converted into the light  and lives of millions. I also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good  and making society better. So I'll come back to the story of when I was caught in the prison  I was very happy freeing  a dozen children from slavery  handing them over to their parents. I cannot explain my joy  when I free a child. I was so happy. But when I was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown  Delhi  I saw that dozens of children  were arriving  they were being trafficked by someone. I stopped them  those people. I complained to the police. So the policemen  instead of helping me  they threw me in this small   tiny shell  like an animal. And that was the night of anger when one of the brightest  and biggest ideas was born. I thought that if I keep on freeing     children  and    more will join  that's not done. And I believed in the power of consumers  and let me tell you that this was the first time when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world  to educate and sensitize the consumers to create a demand for child labor free rugs. In Europe and America   we have been successful. And it has resulted  in a fall in child labor in South Asian countries by    percent. Not only that  but this first ever  consumer's power  or consumer's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries  maybe chocolate  maybe apparel   maybe shoes    it has gone beyond. My anger at the age of     when I realized how important education is for every child  I got an idea to collect used books and help the poorest children. I created a book bank at the age of   . But I did not stop. Later on  I cofounded the world's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the Global Campaign for Education. That has helped in changing  the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode  and that has concretely helped  the reduction of out of school children by half in the last    years. My anger at the age of     to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel  has given me an idea to go for a new strategy of raid and rescue  freeing children from slavery. And I am so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or    or     but my colleagues and I have been able to physically liberate        child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers. I knew that we needed global policies. We organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in  a new international convention to protect the children who are in the worst forms. And the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third  in the last    years. So  in each case  it began from anger  turned into an idea  and action. So anger  what next  Idea  and    Audience  Action Kailash Satyarthi  Anger  idea  action. Which I tried to do. Anger is a power  anger is an energy  and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never  be vanished  can never be destroyed. So why can't the energy of anger be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world  a more just and equitable world  Anger is within each one of you  and I will share a secret for a few seconds  that if we are confined in  the narrow shells of egos  and the circles of selfishness  then the anger will turn out to be hatred  violence  revenge  destruction. But if we are able to break the circles  then the same anger could turn  into a great power. We can break the circles  by using our inherent compassion and connect with the world through  compassion to make this world better. That same anger could be transformed into it. So dear friends  sisters and brothers  again  as a Nobel Laureate  I am urging you to become angry. I am urging you to become angry. And the angriest among us is the one who can transform his anger  into idea and action. Thank you so much. Chris Anderson  For many years   you've been an inspiration to others. Who or what inspires you and why  KS  Good question. Chris  let me tell you   and that is the truth  each time when I free a child  the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother  the first smile of freedom  and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter  can ever come back and sit in her lap  they become so emotional and the first tear of joy  rolls down on her cheek  I see the glimpse of God in it    this is my biggest inspiration. And I am so lucky that not once  as I said before  but thousands of times  I have been able to witness my God in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations. Thank you. This is a kindergarten we designed in     . We made this kindergarten  to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. If you are a parent  you know that kids love to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this  The principal of this kindergarten said   No  I don't want a handrail.  I said   It's impossible.  But he insisted   How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof  So that it can catch the children falling off   I said   It's impossible.  And of course  the government official said   Of course you have to have a handrail.  But we could keep  that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call  this rope as a handrail. But of course  rope has nothing to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more  and more  more. Sometimes    children  are around a tree. The boy on the branch  he loves the tree so he is eating the tree. And at the time of an event  they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. Feeding time. And we made the roof as low as possible  because we wanted to see children on top of the roof  not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high  you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place    there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes  you want to spray water to your friends  and the shower  and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this  the boy is not washing his boots  he's putting water into his boots. This kindergarten is completely open  most of the year. And there is no boundary between inside and outside. So it means basically this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box  some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten  there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room  we let him go. He will come back eventually  because it's a circle  it comes back. But the point is  in that kind of occasion  usually children try to hide somewhere. But here  just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly  we consider noise very important. You know that children sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten  these children show amazing concentration in class. And you know  our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know  you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know  these days we are trying to make everything under control. You know  it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in     degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is    degrees. And also  you should know that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So  children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always  some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above. Monkeys. And each classroom has at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building  right next to that oval shaped kindergarten. The building is only five meters tall with seven floors. And of course  the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So  we put our children  a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo  as you know. The driver in front  she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days  kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion  they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. Now  this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between      and     . And the circumference of this building is     meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did       meters in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten do       meters on average. And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says   I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep.  They keep running. My point is don't control them  don't protect them too much  and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable of changing this world  and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. This is a story about capitalism. It's a system I love because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. I started in my   s trading commodities  cotton in particular  in the pits  and if there was ever a free market free for all  this was it  where men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators fought literally  and physically for a profit. Fortunately  I was good enough that by the time I was     I was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management  where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader. And over that time  I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets  and I've traded a lot of crazy manias. And unfortunately  I'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous  certainly of my career  and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. Now  over the past    years  we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow  almost monomaniacal fashion with regard to how we value them  and we have put so much emphasis on profits  on short term quarterly earnings and share prices  at the exclusion of all else. It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies. Now  we don't do that    conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys    we don't do that in our individual life. We don't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income  or their credit score  but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses  and you know what  It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society. And here's how you'll see. This chart is corporate profit margins going back    years as a percentage of revenues  and you can see that we're at a    year high of   .  percent. Now  hooray if you're a shareholder  but if you're the other side of that  and you're the average American worker  then you can see it's not such a good thing.   U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO to Worker Compensation Ratio   Now  higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth. What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality  and that's not a good thing. But intuitively  that makes sense  right  Because if the top    percent of American families own    percent of the stocks  as they take a greater share of corporate profits  then there's less wealth left for the rest of society. Again  income inequality is not a good thing. This next chart  made by The Equality Trust  shows    countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand. On the horizontal axis is income inequality. The further to the right you go  the greater the income inequality. On the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics. The more you go up that  the worse the problems are  and those metrics include life expectancy  teenage pregnancy  literacy  social mobility  just to name a few. Now  those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder  well  where does the United States rank  Where does it lie on that chart  And guess what  We're literally off the chart. Yes  that's us  with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems  according to those metrics. Now  here's a macro forecast that's easy to make  and that's  that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest  it will get closed. History always does it. It typically happens in one of three ways  either through revolution  higher taxes  or wars. None of those are on my bucket list. Now  there's another way to do it  and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior  but the way that we're operating right now  that would require a tremendous change in behavior  and like an addict trying to kick a habit  the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. And let me just say  this profits mania that we're on is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Here's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that  this chart shows corporate giving as a percentage of profits   not revenues  over the last    years. Juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins  and I ask you  does that feel right  In all fairness  when I started writing this  I thought   Oh wow  what does my company  what does Tudor do   And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year. And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist. When I realized that  I literally wanted to throw up. But the point is  this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it. Now  we're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. And oh  by the way  we've since quadrupled that  but     Applause     Please. But we can do it by driving more just behavior. And one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place  and that's the free market system. About a year ago  some friends of mine and I started a not for profit called Just Capital. Its mission is very simple  to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior. Now  right now  there's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow  and that's where Just Capital comes in  because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of        Americans to find out exactly what they think are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior. Now  this is a model that's going to start in the United States but can be expanded anywhere around the globe  and maybe we'll find out that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs  or make healthy products  or help  not harm  the environment. At Just Capital  we don't know  and it's not for us to decide. We're but messengers  but we have     percent confidence  and faith in the American public to get it right. So we'll release the findings this September for the first time  and then next year  we'll poll again  and we'll take the additive step this time of ranking the       largest U.S. companies from number one to number       and everything in between. We're calling it the Just Index  and remember  we're an independent not for profit with no bias  and we will be giving the American public a voice. And maybe over time  we'll find out that as people come to know which companies are the most just  human and economic resources will be driven towards them  and they'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous. Now  capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in. Capitalism has to be based on justice. It has to be  and now more than ever  with economic divisions growing wider every day. It's estimated that    percent of American workers can be displaced in the next    years. I'm not against progress. I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else. But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come greater corporate social responsibility.  If justice is removed   said Adam Smith  the father of capitalism   the great  the immense fabric of human society must in a moment crumble into atoms.  Now  when I was young  and there was a problem  my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say   Have mercy  have mercy.  Now's not the time for us  for the rest of us to show them mercy. The time is now for us to show them fairness  and we can do that  you and I  by starting where we work  in the businesses that we operate in. And when we put justness on par with profits  we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world. We'll take back our humanity. Thank you. Well  you know  sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages. I am going to try to convince you  in the    minutes I have  that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as   Are we alone   and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond  and this is why I am tracking them down in the most impossible places on Earth  in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival. Actually  sometimes me too  when I'm trying to follow them too close. But here's the thing  We are the only advanced civilization in the solar system  but that doesn't mean that there is no microbial life nearby. In fact  the planets and moons you see here could host life    all of them    and we know that  and it's a strong possibility. And if we were going to find life on those moons and planets  then we would answer questions such as  are we alone in the solar system  Where are we coming from  Do we have family in the neighborhood  Is there life beyond our solar system  And we can ask all those questions because there has been a revolution in our understanding of what a habitable planet is  and today  a habitable planet is a planet that has a zone where water can stay stable  but to me this is a horizontal definition of habitability  because it involves a distance to a star  but there is another dimension to habitability  and this is a vertical dimension. Think of it as conditions in the subsurface of a planet where you are very far away from a sun  but you still have water  energy  nutrients  which for some of them means food  and a protection. And when you look at the Earth  very far away from any sunlight  deep in the ocean  you have life thriving and it uses only chemistry for life processes. So when you think of it  at that point  all walls collapse. You have no limitations  basically. And if you have been looking at the headlines lately  then you will see that we have discovered a subsurface ocean on Europa  on Ganymede  on Enceladus  on Titan  and now we are finding a geyser and hot springs on Enceladus  Our solar system is turning into a giant spa. For anybody who has gone to a spa knows how much microbes like that  right  So at that point  think also about Mars. There is no life possible at the surface of Mars today  but it might still be hiding underground. So  we have been making progress in our understanding of habitability  but we also have been making progress in our understanding of what the signatures of life are on Earth. And you can have what we call organic molecules  and these are the bricks of life  and you can have fossils  and you can minerals  biominerals  which is due to the reaction between bacteria and rocks  and of course you can have gases in the atmosphere. And when you look at those tiny green algae on the right of the slide here  they are the direct descendants of those who have been pumping oxygen a billion years ago in the atmosphere of the Earth. When they did that  they poisoned    percent of the life at the surface of the Earth  but they are the reason why you are breathing this air today. But as much as our understanding grows of all of these things  there is one question we still cannot answer  and this is  where are we coming from  And you know  it's getting worse  because we won't be able to find the physical evidence of where we are coming from on this planet  and the reason being is that anything that is older than four billion years is gone. All record is gone  erased by plate tectonics and erosion. This is what I call the Earth's biological horizon. Beyond this horizon we don't know where we are coming from. So is everything lost  Well  maybe not. And we might be able to find evidence of our own origin in the most unlikely place  and this place in Mars. How is this possible  Well clearly at the beginning of the solar system  Mars and the Earth were bombarded by giant asteroids and comets  and there were ejecta from these impacts all over the place. Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks at each other for a very long time. Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth. Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars. So clearly  those two planets may have been seeded by the same material. So yeah  maybe Granddady is sitting there on the surface and waiting for us. But that also means that we can go to Mars and try to find traces of our own origin. Mars may hold that secret for us. This is why Mars is so special to us. But for that to happen  Mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right. So was Mars habitable  We have a number of missions telling us exactly the same thing today. At the time when life appeared on the Earth  Mars did have an ocean  it had volcanoes  it had lakes  and it had deltas like the beautiful picture you see here. This picture was sent by the Curiosity  rover only a few weeks ago. It shows the remnants of a delta  and this picture tells us something  water was abundant and stayed founting at the surface for a very long time. This is good news for life. Life chemistry takes a long time to actually happen. So this is extremely good news  but does that mean that if we go there  life will be easy to find on Mars  Not necessarily. Here's what happened  At the time when life exploded at the surface of the Earth  then everything went south for Mars  literally. The atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds  Mars lost its magnetosphere  and then cosmic rays and U.V. bombarded the surface and water escaped to space and went underground. So if we want to be able to understand  if we want to be able to find those traces of the signatures of life at the surface of Mars  if they are there  we need to understand what was the impact of each of these events on the preservation of its record. Only then will we be able to know where those signatures are hiding  and only then will we be able to send our rover to the right places where we can sample those rocks that may be telling us something really important about who we are  or  if not  maybe telling us that somewhere  independently  life has appeared on another planet. So to do that  it's easy. You only need to go back  .  billion years ago in the past of a planet. We just need a time machine. Easy  right  Well  actually  it is. Look around you    that's planet Earth. This is our time machine. Geologists are using it to go back in the past of our own planet. I am using it a little bit differently. I use planet Earth to go in very extreme environments where conditions were similar to those of Mars at the time when the climate changed  and there I'm trying  to understand what happened. What are the signatures of life  What is left  How are we going to find it  So for one moment now I'm going to take you with me on a trip into that time machine. And now  what you see here  we are at       meters in the Andes  but in fact we are less than a billion years after the Earth and Mars formed. The Earth and Mars will have looked pretty much exactly like that    volcanoes everywhere  evaporating lakes everywhere  minerals  hot springs  and then you see those mounds on the shore of those lakes  Those are built by the descendants of the first organisms that gave us the first fossil on Earth. But if we want to understand what's  going on  we need to go a little further. And the other thing about those sites is that exactly like on Mars three and a half billion years ago  the climate is changing very fast  and water and ice are disappearing. But we need to go back to that time when everything changed on Mars  and to do that  we need to go higher. Why is that  Because when you go higher  the atmosphere is getting thinner  it's getting more unstable  the temperature is getting cooler  and you have a lot more U.V. radiation. Basically  you are getting to those conditions on Mars when everything changed. So I was not promising anything about a leisurely trip on the time machine. You are not going to be sitting in that time machine. You have to haul       pounds of equipment to the summit of this        foot volcano in the Andes here. That's about       meters. And you also have to sleep on    degree slopes and really hope that there won't be any earthquake that night. But when we get to the summit  we actually find the lake we came for. At this altitude  this lake is experiencing exactly the same conditions as those on Mars three and a half billion years ago. And now we have to change our voyage into an inner voyage inside that lake  and to do that  we have to remove our mountain gear and actually don suits and go for it. But at the time we enter that lake  at the very moment we enter that lake  we are stepping back three and a half billion years in the past of another planet  and then we are going to get the answer came for. Life is everywhere  absolutely everywhere. Everything you see in this picture is a living organism. Maybe not so the diver  but everything else. But this picture is very deceiving. Life is abundant in those lakes  but like in many places on Earth  right now and due to climate change  there is a huge loss in biodiversity. In the samples that we took back home     percent of the bacteria in those lakes were composed of three species  and those three species are the ones that have survived so far. Here's another lake  right next to the first one. The red color you see here is not due to minerals. It's actually due to the presence of a tiny algae. In this region  the U.V. radiation is really nasty. Anywhere on Earth     is considered to be extreme. During U.V. storms there  the U.V. Index reaches   . SPF    is not going to do anything  to you over there  and the water is so transparent in those lakes that the algae has nowhere to hide  really  and so they are developing their own sunscreen  and this is the red color you see. But they can adapt only so far  and then when all the water is gone from the surface  microbes have only one solution left  They go underground. And those microbes  the rocks you see in that slide here  well  they are actually living inside rocks and they are using the protection of the translucence of the rocks to get the good part of the U.V. and discard the part that could actually damage their DNA. And this is why we are taking our rover to train them to search  for life on Mars in these areas  because if there was life on Mars three and a half billion years ago  it had to use the same strategy to actually protect itself. Now  it is pretty obvious that going to extreme environments is helping us very much for the exploration of Mars  and to prepare missions. So far  it has helped us to understand the geology of Mars. It has helped to understand the past climate of Mars and its evolution  but also its habitability potential. Our most recent rover on Mars has discovered traces of organics. Yeah  there are organics at the surface of Mars. And it also discovered traces of methane. And we don't know yet if the methane in question is really from geology or biology. Regardless  what we know is that because of the discovery  the hypothesis that there is still life present on Mars today remains a viable one. So by now  I think I have convinced you that Mars is very special to us  but it would be a mistake to think that Mars is the only place in the solar system that is interesting to find potential microbial life. And the reason is because Mars and the Earth could have a common root to their tree of life  but when you go beyond Mars  it's not that easy. Celestial mechanics  is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets  and so if we were to discover life on those planets  it would be different from us. It would be a different type of life. But in the end  it might be just us  it might be us and Mars  or it can be many trees of life in the solar system. I don't know the answer yet  but I can tell you something  No matter what the result is  no matter what that magic number is  it is going to give us a standard by which we are going to be able  to measure the life potential  abundance and diversity beyond our own solar system. And this can be achieved by our generation. This can be our legacy  but only if we dare to explore. Now  finally  if somebody tells you that looking  for alien microbes is not cool because you cannot have a philosophical conversation with them  let me show you why and how you can tell them they're wrong. Well  organic material is going to tell you about environment  about complexity and about diversity. DNA  or any information carrier  is going to tell you about adaptation  about evolution  about survival  about planetary changes and about the transfer of information. All together  they are telling us what started as a microbial pathway  and why what started as a microbial pathway sometimes ends up as a civilization or sometimes ends up as a dead end. Look at the solar system  and look at the Earth. On Earth  there are many intelligent species  but only one has achieved technology. Right here in the journey of our own solar system  there is a very  very powerful message that says here's how we should look  for alien life  small and big. So yeah  microbes are talking and we are listening  and they are taking us  one planet at a time and one moon at a time  towards their big brothers out there. And they are telling us about diversity  they are telling us about abundance of life  and they are telling us how this life has survived thus far to reach civilization  intelligence  technology and  indeed  philosophy. Thank you. To be honest  by personality  I'm just not much of a crier. But I think in my career that's been a good thing. I'm a civil rights lawyer  and I've seen some  horrible things in the world. I began my career working  police abuse cases in the United States. And then in       I was sent to Rwanda to be the director of the U.N.'s  genocide investigation. It turns out that tears  just aren't much help when you're trying  to investigate a genocide. The things I had to see   and feel and touch were pretty unspeakable. What I can tell you is this  that the Rwandan genocide was one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion. That word  compassion  actually  comes from two Latin words  cum passio  which simply mean   to suffer with.  And the things that I saw and experienced in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering  it did  in moments  move me to tears. But I just wish that I   and the rest of the world  had been moved earlier. And not just to tears  but to actually stop the genocide. Now by contrast  I've also been involved with one of the world's greatest successes of compassion. And that's the fight against  global poverty. It's a cause that probably has involved all of us here. I don't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of  We Are the World   or maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door  or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water. I don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but I do remember the most jarring. It was when I met Venus    she's a mom from Zambia. She's got three kids and she's a widow. When I met her  she had walked about    miles in the only garments she owned  to come to the capital city and to share her story. She sat down with me for hours  just ushered me in to  the world of poverty. She described what it was like  when the coals on the cooking fire finally just went completely cold. When that last drop  of cooking oil finally ran out. When the last of the food   despite her best efforts  ran out. She had to watch her youngest son  Peter  suffer from malnutrition  as his legs just slowly bowed  into uselessness. As his eyes grew cloudy and dim. And then as Peter finally grew cold. For over    years  stories like this have been moving us to compassion. We whose kids have plenty to eat. And we're moved not only  to care about global poverty  but to actually try to do our part  to stop the suffering. Now there's plenty of room for critique  that we haven't done enough  and what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough  but the truth is this  The fight against global poverty is probably the broadest  longest running manifestation of the  human phenomenon of compassion in the history of our species. And so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle. But first  let me begin with what you probably already know. Thirty five years ago  when I would have been graduating from high school  they told us that        kids every day died because of poverty. That number  today  is now  down to       . Way too many  of course  but it does mean that every year  there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty. Moreover  the number of  people in our world who are living in extreme poverty  which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day  that has fallen from    percent  to only    percent. This is massive progress  and this exceeds everybody's  expectations about what is possible. And I think you and I  I think  honestly  that we can  feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion  actually has the power to succeed in stopping  the suffering of millions. But here's the part that you  might not hear very much about. If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day  it turns out that virtually  the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school  are still stuck there     years later. So why  why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty  Well  let's think about Venus for a moment. Now for decades  my wife and I have been moved by common compassion to sponsor kids  to fund microloans  to support generous levels of foreign aid. But until I had actually talked to Venus  I would have had no idea that  none of those approaches actually addressed why she had to watch her son die.  We were doing fine   Venus told me   until Brutus started to cause trouble.  Now  Brutus is Venus' neighbor  and  cause trouble  is what happened the day after Venus' husband died  when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house  stole all their land  and robbed their market stall. You see  Venus was thrown  into destitution by violence. And then it occurred to me  of course  that none of my child sponsorships  none of the microloans  none of the traditional  anti poverty programs were going to stop Brutus  because they weren't meant to. This became even more clear to me when I met Griselda. She's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community in Guatemala. And one of the things we've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing that Griselda and her family can do to get Griselda and her family  out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school. The experts call this the Girl Effect. But when we met Griselda   she wasn't going to school. In fact  she was rarely ever  leaving her home. Days before we met her  while she was walking home from church with her family  in broad daylight  men from her community  just snatched her off the street  and violently raped her. See  Griselda had every opportunity to go to school  it just wasn't safe for her to get there. And Griselda's not the only one. Around the world  poor women and girls between the ages of    and     they are    when victims of  the everyday violence of domestic abuse and sexual violence    those two forms of violence account for more death and disability than malaria  than car accidents  than war combined. The truth is  the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence. In South Asia  for instance  I could drive past this rice mill and see this man hoisting  these     pound sacks of rice upon his thin back. But I would have no idea  until later  that he was actually a slave  held by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school. Decades of anti poverty programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the beatings and the rapes and the torture of violence inside the rice mill. In fact  half a century of  anti poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history. Experts tell us that there's about    million people in slavery today. That's about the population  of the entire nation of Canada  where we're sitting today. This is why  over time  I have come to call this epidemic of violence the Locust Effect. Because in the lives of the poor  it just descends like a plague and it destroys everything. In fact  now when you survey very  very poor communities  residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence. But notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of  genocide or the wars  it's everyday violence. So for me  as a lawyer  of course  my first reaction was to think  well  of course we've got to change all the laws. We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal. But then I found out  it already is. The problem is not that  the poor don't get laws  it's that they don't get law enforcement. In the developing world  basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the U.N. issued  a report that found that  most poor people live outside the protection of the law.  Now honestly  you and I have  just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no  first hand experience of it. Functioning law enforcement for us  is just a total assumption. In fact  nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers         which  of course  is the number for the emergency police operator here in Canada and in the United States  where the average response time  to a police     emergency call is about    minutes. So we take this just  completely for granted. But what if there was no  law enforcement to protect you  A woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like. She was home alone in her  dark house on a Saturday night  when a man started to tear  his way into her home. This was her worst nightmare  because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before. So terrified  she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do  She calls        but only to learn that because  of budget cuts in her county  law enforcement wasn't available  on the weekends. Listen. Dispatcher  I don't have anybody  to send out there. Woman  OK Dispatcher  Um  obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you  can you ask him to go away  Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything  Woman  I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you. He's broken in before  busted down my door  assaulted me. Dispatcher  Uh huh. Woman  Um  yeah  so ... Dispatcher  Is there any way you could safely leave the residence  Woman  No  I can't  because he's blocking pretty much my only way out. Dispatcher  Well  the only thing I can do  is give you some advice  and call the sheriff's office tomorrow. Obviously  if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon or is trying to cause you physical harm  that's a different story. You know  the sheriff's office doesn't work up there. I don't have anybody to send.  Gary Haugen  Tragically  the woman  inside that house was violently assaulted  choked and raped because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law. And this is where billions of our poorest live. What does that look like  In Bolivia  for example  if a man  sexually assaults a poor child  statistically  he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying than he is of ever going  to jail for that crime. In South Asia  if you  enslave a poor person  you're at greater risk of being  struck by lightning than ever being sent  to jail for that crime. And so the epidemic of everyday  violence  it just rages on. And it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people out of their two dollar a day hell. Because the data just doesn't lie. It turns out that you can give  all manner of goods and services to the poor  but if you don't restrain the hands  of the violent bullies from taking it all away  you're going to be very disappointed in the long term impact of your efforts. So you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty. But it's not. Auditors of international assistance recently couldn't find even one percent of aid going  to protect the poor from the lawless chaos  of everyday violence. And honestly  when we do talk about  violence against the poor  sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways. A fresh water organization tells a heart wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water  and then celebrates the solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk. End of story. But not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community. If a young woman on one  of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library  we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm. And yet  for some reason  this is okay for poor people. Now the truth is  the traditional experts in economic development and poverty alleviation  they don't know how to fix this problem. And so what happens  They don't talk about it. But the more fundamental reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected  is because the people inside the developing world  with money  don't need it. I was at the World Economic  Forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world and I was just asking them   How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence   And they looked at each other   and they said  practically in unison   We buy it.  Indeed  private security forces  in the developing world are now  four  five and seven times larger than the public police force. In Africa  the largest employer  on the continent now is private security. But see  the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer  but the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground. This is a massive and scandalous outrage. And it doesn't have to be this way. Broken law enforcement can be fixed. Violence can be stopped. Almost all criminal justice systems  they start out broken and corrupt  but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment. The path forward is really pretty clear. Number one  We have to start making stopping violence indispensable  to the fight against poverty. In fact  any conversation about global poverty that doesn't include the problem  of violence must be deemed not serious. And secondly  we have to begin  to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support  the developing world as they fashion new   public systems of justice  not private security  that give everybody a chance to be safe. These transformations  are actually possible and they're happening today. Recently  the Gates Foundation  funded a project in the second largest city  of the Philippines  where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically  that in just four short years  they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence  against poor kids by    percent. You know  from the hindsight of history  what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable are the simple failures of compassion. Because I think history convenes  a tribunal of our grandchildren and they just ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you  Where were you  Grandpa  when  the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany and were being rejected from our shores  Where were you  And Grandma  where were you when they were marching our Japanese American neighbors off to internment camps  And Grandpa  where were you  when they were beating our African American neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote   Likewise  when our grandchildren ask us   Grandma  Grandpa  where were you when two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos of everyday violence   I hope we can say that we had compassion  that we raised our voice  and as a generation  we were moved to make the violence stop. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Really powerfully argued. Talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to  for example  boost police training. How hard a process is that  GH  Well  one of the glorious  things that's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious. There's actually  now   political will to do that. But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise. There's a political will struggle  that's going to take place as well  but those are winnable fights  because we've done some examples around the world at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging. CA  So just tell us in one country  how much it costs to make a material difference  to police  for example    I know that's only one piece of it. GH  In Guatemala  for instance  we've started a project there with the local police  and court system  prosecutors  to retrain them so that they can  actually effectively bring these cases. And we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by more than       percent. This project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year  and the kind of bang  you can get for your buck in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led  and these countries   especially a middle class that is seeing that there's  really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security I think there's an opportunity  a window for change. CA  But to make this happen  you have to look at each part in the chain    the police  who else  GH  So that's the thing  about law enforcement  it starts out with the police  they're the front end of the pipeline of justice  but they hand if off to the prosecutors  and the prosecutors  hand it off to the courts  and the survivors of violence  have to be supported by social services all the way through that. So you have to do an approach  that pulls that all together. In the past  there's been a little bit of training of the courts  but they get crappy evidence  from the police  or a little police intervention  that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement  so it's about pulling that all together  and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us  which is imperfect in our  own experience  for sure  but boy  is it a great thing to sense that you can call     and maybe someone will protect you. CA  Gary  I think you've done  a spectacular job of bringing this to the world's attention in your book and right here today. Thanks so much. Gary Haugen. My first love was for the night sky. Love is complicated. You're looking at a fly through of the  Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field  one of the most distant images of our universe ever observed. Everything you see here is a galaxy  comprised of billions of stars each. And the farthest galaxy is  a trillion  trillion kilometers away. As an astrophysicist  I have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects  in our universe. The objects that have captivated me  from first crush throughout my career are supermassive   hyperactive black holes. Weighing one to    billion times  the mass of our own sun  these galactic black holes  are devouring material  at a rate of upwards of        times more than your  average   supermassive black hole. These two characteristics  with a few others  make them quasars. At the same time  the objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed. These narrow streams  called jets  are moving at   .   percent  of the speed of light  and are pointed directly at the Earth. These jetted  Earth pointed  hyperactive and supermassive black holes are called blazars  or blazing quasars. What makes blazars so special is that they're some of the universe's most efficient particle accelerators  transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy. Here  I'm showing an artist's conception of a blazar. The dinner plate by which  material falls onto the black hole is called the accretion disc  shown here in blue. Some of that material is slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet  shown here in white. Although the blazar system is rare  the process by which nature pulls in material via a disk  and then flings some of it out via a jet  is more common. We'll eventually zoom out of  the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to the larger galactic context. Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out  one of the hot topics in  blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest energy  jet emission comes from. In this image  I'm interested in where this white blob forms and if  as a result  there's any  relationship between the jet and the accretion disc material. Clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until       when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light    that is  light with energies a million times higher than your standard x ray scan. I simultaneously compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to day and year to year  to better localize these gamma ray blobs. My research shows that in some instances  these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially thought. As we more confidently localize where these gamma ray  blobs are forming  we can better understand how jets are being accelerated  and ultimately reveal  the dynamic processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed. This all started as a love story. And it still is. This love transformed me from  a curious  stargazing young girl to a professional astrophysicist  hot on the heels of celestial discovery. Who knew that chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth. Then again  when do we ever know where love's first flutter will truly take us. Thank you. Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place. It was the     s. I got into the field very young  I was seven years old. And the tool that I used  to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle. This is a commercial for  that particular item  Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle. That gyro power sends him  over     feet at top speed. Chris Milk  So this was my joy back then. I rode this motorcycle everywhere. And I was there with Evel Knievel  we  jumped the Snake River Canyon together. I wanted the rocket. I never got the rocket  I only got the motorcycle. I felt so connected to this world. I didn't want to be a storyteller  when I grew up  I wanted to be stuntman. I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend. I had so much empathy for him. But it didn't work out.  Laughter  I went to art school. I started making music videos. And this is one of the early music videos that I made  CM  You may notice  some slight similarities here. And I got that rocket. So  now I'm a filmmaker  or  the beginning of a filmmaker  and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience. And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely  foreign from our own. Unfortunately  Evel Knievel did not feel the same  empathy for us that we felt for him  and he sued us for this video    shortly thereafter. On the upside  the man  that I worshipped as a child  the man that I wanted  to become as an adult  I was finally able to get his autograph. Let's talk about film now. Film  it's an incredible medium  but essentially  it's the same now as it was then. It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence. And we've done incredible things with those rectangles. But I started thinking about  is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for     years  So I started experimenting  and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine. And here's one of the early experiments  So this is called  The Wilderness Downtown.  It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire. It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it. It's a website. And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows. And you see this teenager  running down a street  and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours. And when he stops in front of a house  he stops in front of your house. And this was great  and I saw people  having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that  I had made in rectangles. And I'm essentially taking  a piece of your history and putting it inside  the framing of the story. But then I started thinking  okay  well that's a part of you  but how do I put all of you inside of the frame  So to do that  I started making art installations. And this is one called   The Treachery of Sanctuary.  It's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel. So now I've got you inside of the frame  and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one. But then I started thinking about frames  and what do they represent  And a frame is just a window. I mean  all the media that we watch    television  cinema    they're these windows into  these other worlds. And I thought  well  great.  I got you in a frame. But I don't want you in the frame  I don't want you in the window  I want you through the window  I want you on the other side  in the world  inhabiting the world. So that leads me back to virtual reality. Let's talk about virtual reality. Unfortunately  talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture. And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality. So  it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain  It's difficult because it's a very  experiential medium. You feel your way inside of it. It's a machine  but inside of it  it feels like real life  it feels like truth. And you feel present in the world that you're inside and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with. So  I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film  a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality. So we're shooting in every direction. This is a camera system that we built that has  D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction. We take this and we build  basically  a sphere of a world that you inhabit. So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world  it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle. So this film is called   Clouds Over Sidra   and it was made in conjunction with  our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations  and a co collaborator named Gabo Arora. And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December and shot the story of a    year old girl there named Sidra. And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half. I am    years old. I am in the fifth grade. I am from Syria  in the Daraa Province  Inkhil City. I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half. I have a big family  three brothers  one is a baby. He cries a lot. I asked my father if I cried when  I was a baby and he says I did not. I think I was a stronger baby than my brother. CM  So  when you're inside  of the headset. you're not seeing it like this. You're looking around through this world. You'll notice you see full     degrees  in all directions. And when you're sitting there in her room  watching her  you're not watching it through a television screen  you're not watching it through a window  you're sitting there with her. When you look down  you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on. And because of that  you feel her humanity in a deeper way. You empathize with her in a deeper way. And I think that we can change minds with this machine. And we've already started to try to change a few. So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people. And these are people  who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent  in a refugee camp in Jordan. But in January  one afternoon in Switzerland  they suddenly all found themselves there. And they were affected by it. So we're going to make more of them. We're working with the  United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films. We just finished shooting a story in Liberia. And now  we're going  to shoot a story in India. And we're taking these films  and we're showing them  at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there. And we're showing  them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films. And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality. It's not a video game peripheral. It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before  in any other form of media. And it can change people's perception of each other. And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world. So  it's a machine  but through this machine we become more compassionate  we become more empathetic  and we become more connected. And ultimately  we become more human. Thank you. Growing up  I didn't always understand why my parents made me follow the rules that they did. Like  why did I really  have to mow the lawn  Why was homework really that important  Why couldn't I put jelly beans  in my oatmeal  My childhood was abound with questions like this. Normal things about being a kid and realizing that sometimes  it was best to listen to my parents even when I didn't exactly understand why. And it's not that they didn't want me to think critically. Their parenting always sought  to reconcile the tension between having my siblings and I understand the realities of the world  while ensuring that we never accepted the status quo as inevitable. I came to realize that this  in and of itself  was a very purposeful form of education. One of my favorite educators  Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire  speaks quite explicitly about the need for education to be used as a tool for critical  awakening and shared humanity. In his most famous book   Pedagogy of the Oppressed   he states   No one can be  authentically human while he prevents others from being so.  I've been thinking a lot about this  lately  this idea of humanity  and specifically  who in this world is afforded the privilege of being perceived as fully human. Over the course of  the past several months  the world has watched as unarmed black men  and women  have had their lives taken at the hands of police and vigilante. These events and all that  has transpired after them have brought me back to my own childhood and the decisions that my parents made about raising a black boy in America that growing up  I didn't always understand in the way that I do now. I think of how hard it must have been  how profoundly unfair it must have felt for them to feel like they had  to strip away parts of my childhood just so that I could come home at night. For example  I think of how one night  when I was around    years old  on an overnight field trip to another city  my friends and I bought Super Soakers and turned the hotel parking lot into our own water filled battle zone. We hid behind cars  running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights  boundless laughter ubiquitous  across the pavement. But within    minutes  my father came outside   grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip. Before I could say anything  tell him how foolish he had  made me look in front of my friends  he derided me for being so naive. Looked me in the eye   fear consuming his face  and said   Son  I'm sorry  but you can't act the same  as your white friends. You can't pretend to shoot guns. You can't run around in the dark. You can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth.  I know now how scared he must have been  how easily I could have fallen into the empty of the night  that some man would mistake this water for a good reason to wash all of this away. These are the sorts of messages I've been inundated with my entire life  Always keep your hands where they  can see them  don't move too quickly  take off your hood when the sun goes down. My parents raised me and my siblings in an armor of advice  an ocean of alarm bells so someone wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs  so that they wouldn't make a memory of this skin. So that we could be kids   not casket or concrete. And it's not because they thought it would make us better than anyone else it's simply because they wanted  to keep us alive. All of my black friends were raised with the same message  the talk  given to us  when we became old enough to be mistaken for a nail ready to be hammered to the ground  when people made our melanin synonymous with something to be feared. But what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you cannot simply be a child  That the whims of adolescence are too dangerous for your breath  that you cannot simply be curious  that you are not afforded the luxury of making a mistake  that someone's implicit bias might be the reason you don't wake up in the morning. But this cannot be what defines us. Because we have parents who raised us to understand that our bodies weren't meant for the backside of a bullet  but for flying kites and jumping rope  and laughing until our stomachs burst. We had teachers who taught us  how to raise our hands in class  and not just to signal surrender  and that the only thing we should give up is the idea that we  aren't worthy of this world. So when we say that black lives matter  it's not because others don't  it's simply because we must affirm that we are worthy of existing without fear  when so many things tell us we are not. I want to live in a world where my son will not be presumed guilty the moment he is born  where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken for anything other than a toy. And I refuse to accept that we can't build this world into something new  some place where a child's name doesn't have to be written  on a t shirt  or a tombstone  where the value of someone's life isn't determined by anything other  than the fact that they had lungs  a place where every single  one of us can breathe. Thank you. These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures. They're bizzarre  they're beautiful  and there's very little we know about them. These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book. I was about five years old at the time  and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist. Paleontology allowed me  to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to  far flung corners of the world. And now  a few years later  I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far flung corner  on this planet  the Sahara. I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre  giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus. A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about     years ago by a German paleontologist. Unfortunately  all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II. So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes. From these drawings  we know that this creature  which lived  about     million years ago  was very big  it had tall spines on its back  forming a magnificent sail  and it had long  slender jaws   a bit like a crocodile  with conical teeth  that may have been used  to catch slippery prey  like fish. But that was pretty much  all we knew about this animal for the next     years. My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria  a place called the Kem Kem. It's a difficult place to work in. You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions  and it's very difficult to find good fossils there. But our hard work paid off. We discovered many incredible specimens. There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara. We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs  medium sized predatory dinosaurs  and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile like hunters. These fossils were deposited in a river system. The river system was also home  to a giant  car sized coelacanth  a monster sawfish  and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs  flying reptiles. It was a pretty dangerous place  not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine. So we're finding all these  incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus  but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive. We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point. Finally  very recently  we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus. We returned to the site  we collected more bones. And so after     years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature. And we were able to reconstruct it. We now know that  Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile  very different from other  predatory dinosaurs  very different from the T. rex. But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton. We had long spines  the spines forming the big sail. We had leg bones  we had skull bones  we had paddle shaped feet  wide feet    again  very unusual  no other dinosaur has feet like this    and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment  or maybe for paddling in the water. We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone  the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones  and it turns out that they're very dense and compact. Again  this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water  it's useful for buoyancy  control in the water. We C.T. scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton. And when we looked  at the digital skeleton  we realized that yes  this was a dinosaur unlike any other. It's bigger than a T. rex  and yes  the head has  fish eating  written all over it  but really the entire skeleton has  water loving  written all over it    dense bone  paddle like feet  and the hind limbs are reduced in size  and again  this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount  of time in the water. So  as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus    I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin    we realize that we're dealing with a river monster  a predatory dinosaur  bigger than T. rex  the ruler of this ancient river of giants  feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on. So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery. It's a dinosaur like no other. And some people told me   Wow  this is a once in a lifetime discovery. There are not many things left to discover in the world.  Well  I think nothing could be  further from the truth. I think the Sahara's  still full of treasures  and when people tell me there are no places left to explore  I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter  Roy Chapman Andrews  and he said   Always  there has been an adventure just around the corner    and the world is still full of corners.  That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines. And it is still true today. Thank you. I work with a bunch of mathematicians  philosophers and computer scientists  and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence  among other things. Some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction y  far out there  crazy. But I like to say  okay  let's look at the modern human condition. This is the normal way for things to be. But if we think about it  we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet  the human species. Think about if Earth was created one year ago  the human species  then   would be    minutes old. The industrial era started two seconds ago. Another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last        years  I've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph. It looks like this. It's a curious shape for a normal condition. I sure wouldn't want to sit on it. Let's ask ourselves  what is the cause of this current anomaly  Some people would say it's technology. Now it's true  technology has accumulated through human history  and right now  technology advances extremely rapidly    that is the proximate cause  that's why we are currently  so very productive. But I like to think back further  to the ultimate cause. Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen  We have Kanzi    he's mastered     lexical tokens  an incredible feat. And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution. If we look under the hood   this is what we find  basically the same thing. One is a little larger  it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it's wired. These invisible differences cannot be too complicated  however  because there have only been         generations since our last common ancestor. We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve. So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten  from broken off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles. So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we've achieved  and everything we care about  depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind. And the corollary  of course  is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially  enormous consequences. Some of my colleagues  think we're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate  and that is machine superintelligence. Artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box. You would have human programmers that would painstakingly  handcraft knowledge items. You build up these expert systems  and they were kind of useful  for some purposes  but they were very brittle  you couldn't scale them. Basically  you got out only what you put in. But since then  a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence. Today  the action is really  around machine learning. So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features  we create algorithms that learn  often from raw perceptual data. Basically the same thing that the human infant does. The result is A.I. that is not limited to one domain    the same system can learn to translate  between any pairs of languages  or learn to play any computer game on the Atari console. Now of course  A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful  cross domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has. The cortex still has some  algorithmic tricks that we don't yet know how to match in machines. So the question is  how far are we from being able to match those tricks  A couple of years ago  we did a survey of some of the world's  leading A.I. experts  to see what they think  and one of the questions we asked was   By which year do you think there is a    percent probability that we will have achieved  human level machine intelligence   We defined human level here  as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human  so real human level  not just within some limited domain. And the median answer was      or       depending on precisely which  group of experts we asked. Now  it could happen much  much later  or sooner  the truth is nobody really knows. What we do know is that the ultimate  limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside  the limits in biological tissue. This comes down to physics. A biological neuron fires  maybe   at     hertz      times a second. But even a present day transistor operates at the Gigahertz. Neurons propagate slowly in axons      meters per second  tops. But in computers  signals can travel at the speed of light. There are also size limitations  like a human brain has  to fit inside a cranium  but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger. So the potential for superintelligence  lies dormant in matter  much like the power of the atom  lay dormant throughout human history  patiently waiting there until     . In this century  scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence. And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion. Now most people  when they think about what is smart and what is dumb  I think have in mind a picture roughly like this. So at one end we have the village idiot  and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten  or Albert Einstein  or whoever your favorite guru is. But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence  the true picture is actually probably more like this  AI starts out at this point here  at zero intelligence  and then  after many  many  years of really hard work  maybe eventually we get to mouse level artificial intelligence  something that can navigate  cluttered environments as well as a mouse can. And then  after many  many more years of really hard work  lots of investment  maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee level artificial intelligence. And then  after even more years  of really  really hard work  we get to village idiot  artificial intelligence. And a few moments later   we are beyond Ed Witten. The train doesn't stop at Humanville Station. It's likely  rather  to swoosh right by. Now this has profound implications  particularly when it comes  to questions of power. For example  chimpanzees are strong    pound for pound  a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male. And yet  the fate of Kanzi  and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves. Once there is superintelligence  the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does. Think about it  Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. Machines will then be better  at inventing than we are  and they'll be doing so  on digital timescales. What this means is basically a telescoping of the future. Think of all the crazy technologies  that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time  cures for aging  space colonization  self replicating nanobots or uploading of minds into computers  all kinds of science fiction y stuff that's nevertheless consistent  with the laws of physics. All of this superintelligence could  develop  and possibly quite rapidly. Now  a superintelligence with such  technological maturity would be extremely powerful  and at least in some scenarios  it would be able to get what it wants. We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I. Now a good question is  what are those preferences  Here it gets trickier. To make any headway with this  we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing. And this is ironic because  every newspaper article about the future of A.I. has a picture of this  So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly  not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios. We need to think of intelligence  as an optimization process  a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations. A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process. It's extremely good at using  available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized. This means that there is no necessary conenction between being highly intelligent in this sense  and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful. Suppose we give an A.I. the goal  to make humans smile. When the A.I. is weak  it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal  take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant  beaming grins. Another example  suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem. When the A.I. becomes superintelligent  it realizes that the most effective way  to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer  so as to increase its thinking capacity. And notice that this gives the A.I.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of. Human beings in this model are threats  we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved. Of course  perceivably things won't  go wrong in these particular ways  these are cartoon examples. But the general point here is important  if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x  you better make sure  that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about. This is a lesson that's also taught in many a myth. King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold. He touches his daughter   she turns into gold. He touches his food  it turns into gold. This could become practically relevant  not just as a metaphor for greed  but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived  or poorly specified goals. Now you might say  if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people's faces  we'd just shut it off. A  this is not necessarily so easy to do if we've grown dependent on the system    like  where is the off switch  to the Internet  B  why haven't the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity  or the Neanderthals  They certainly had reasons. We have an off switch   for example  right here. The reason is that we are  an intelligent adversary  we can anticipate threats  and plan around them. But so could a superintelligent agent  and it would be much better  at that than we are. The point is  we should not be confident that we have this under control here. And we could try to make our job a little bit easier by  say  putting the A.I. in a box  like a secure software environment  a virtual reality simulation from which it cannot escape. But how confident can we be that the A.I. couldn't find a bug. Given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time  I'd say  probably not very confident. So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap  but again  like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering. Right now  as I speak  I'm sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out  her account details by somebody claiming to be from the I.T. department. More creative scenarios are also possible  like if you're the A.I.  you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate. Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction  and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you  they look at the source code    Bam     the manipulation can take place. Or it could output the blueprint to a really nifty technology  and when we implement it  it has some surreptitious side effect that the A.I. had planned. The point here is that we should  not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever. Sooner or later  it will out. I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I. such that even if    when    it escapes  it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values. I see no way around  this difficult problem. Now  I'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved. We wouldn't have to write down  a long list of everything we care about  or worse yet  spell it out  in some computer language like C   or Python  that would be a task beyond hopeless. Instead  we would create an A.I. that uses its intelligence to learn what we value  and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of. We would thus leverage  its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value loading. This can happen  and the outcome could be  very good for humanity. But it doesn't happen automatically. The initial conditions  for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up  in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation. The values that the A.I. has need to match ours  not just in the familiar context  like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves  but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved  sorted out  the exact details of its decision theory  how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth. So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult    not as difficult as making  a superintelligent A.I.  but fairly difficult. Here is the worry  Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge. Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional  challenge on top of that. The risk is that if somebody figures out how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked  the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety. So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance  so that we have it available  by the time it is needed. Now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the  architecture where it will be implemented. But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance  the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well. This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if  things turn out okay  that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right. Thank you. The brain is an amazing and complex organ. And while many people are fascinated by the brain  they can't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don't teach neuroscience in schools. And one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions. And so in order to be able to access the brain  you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools. And that's a shame because one out of five of us  that's    percent of the entire world  will have a neurological disorder. And there are zero cures for these diseases. And so it seems that what we should be doing is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future  they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist. When I was a graduate student  my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself  decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone that you know  an amateur or a high school student  could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience. And so we did just that. A few years ago  we started a company called Backyard Brains and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight  and I want to do some demonstrations. You guys want to see some  So I need a volunteer. So right before    what is your name   Applause  Sam Kelly  Sam. Greg Gage  All right  Sam  I'm going to record from your brain. Have you had this before  SK  No. GG  I need you to stick out your arm for science  roll up your sleeve a bit  So what I'm going to do  I'm putting electrodes on your arm  and you're probably wondering  I just said I'm going to record from your brain  what am I doing with your arm  Well  you have about    billion neurons inside your brain right now. They're sending electrical messages back and forth  and chemical messages. But some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this. They're going to go down across your corpus callosum  down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron out to your muscles here  and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up by these electrodes right here and we're going to be able to listen to exactly what your brain is going to be doing. So I'm going to turn this on for a second. Have you ever heard what your brain sounds like  SK  No. GG  Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand. So what you're listening to  so this is your motor units happening right here. Let's take a look at it as well. So I'm going to stand over here  and I'm going to open up our app here. So now I want you to squeeze. So right here  these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here  and as she's doing it  you're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here. You can even click here and try to see one of them. So keep doing it really hard. So now we've paused on one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain. Do you guys want to see some more  That's interesting  but let's get it better. I need one more volunteer. What is your name  sir  Miguel Goncalves  Miguel. GG  Miguel  all right. You're going to stand right here. So when you're moving your arm like this  your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here. I want you to move your arm as well. So your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles. And so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here that runs up here that innervates these three fingers  and it's close enough to the skin that we might be able to stimulate that so that what we can do is copy your brain signals going out to your hand and inject it into your hand  so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move. So in a sense  she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand. You with me  So I just need to hook you up. So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve  which is probably right around here. You don't know what you're signing up for when you come up. So now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in to our human to human interface over here. Okay  so Sam  I want you to squeeze your hand again. Do it again. Perfect. So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the    It's going to feel a little bit weird at first  this is going to feel like a     Laughter  You know  when you lose your free will  and someone else becomes your agent  it does feel a bit strange. Now I want you to relax your hand. Sam  you're with me  So you're going to squeeze. I'm not going to turn it on yet  so go ahead and give it a squeeze. So now  are you ready  Miguel  MG  Ready as I'll ever be. GG  I've turned it on  so go ahead and turn your hand. Do you feel that a little bit  MG  Nope. GG  Okay  do it again  MG  A little bit. GG  A little bit   Laughter  So relax. So hit it again. Oh  perfect  perfect. So relax  do it again. All right  so right now  your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm  so go ahead and just do it one more time. All right  so it's perfect.  Laughter  So now  what would happen if I took over my control of your hand  And so  just relax your hand. What happens  Ah  nothing. Why not  Because the brain has to do it. So you do it again. All right  that's perfect. Thank you guys for being such a good sport. This is what's happening all across the world    electrophysiology  We're going to bring on the neuro revolution. Thank you. Hi. I'm going to talk  to you today about laughter  and I just want to start  by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter. This is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six. And I came across my parents doing something unusual  where they were laughing. They were laughing very  very hard. They were lying on the floor laughing. They were screaming with laughter. I did not know what they were  laughing at  but I wanted in. I wanted to be part of that  and I kind of sat around at the edge going   Hoo hoo    Laughter  Now  incidentally  what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing  which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains. And the thing you have to remember about the English is  of course  we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor. At the time  though  I didn't understand anything of that. I just cared about the laughter  and actually  as a neuroscientist  I've come to care about it again. And it is a really weird thing to do. What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing  and I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be  and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound. It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech. So here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful. Now this next guy  I need him to breathe. There's a point in there where I'm just  like  you've got to get some air in there  mate  because he just sounds like he's breathing out. This hasn't been edited  this is him. And finally we have     this is a human female laughing. And laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises. She actually says   Oh my God  what is that   in French. We're all kind of with her. I have no idea. Now  to understand laughter  you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at  which is the ribcage  and it doesn't seem terribly exciting  but actually you're all using  your ribcage all the time. What you're all doing  at the moment with your ribcage  and don't stop doing it  is breathing. So you use the intercostal muscles  the muscles between your ribs  to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage  and if I was to put a strap  around the outside of your chest called a breath belt  and just look  at that movement  you see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement  so that's breathing. You're all doing it. Don't stop. As soon as you start talking  you start using your breathing completely differently. So what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this. In talking  you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out    and in fact  we're the only animals that can do this. It's why we can talk at all. Now  both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy  and that enemy is laughter  because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly  and you get this very marked sort of zig zagging  and that's just squeezing the air out of you. It literally is that basic a way of making a sound. You could be stamping on somebody  it's having the same effect. You're just squeezing air out  and each of those contractions    Ha     gives you a sound. And as the contractions run together  you can get these spasms  and that's when you start getting these     Wheezing     things happening. I'm brilliant at this.  Laughter  Now  in terms of the science of laughter  there isn't very much  but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong. So it's not at all unusual  for example  to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh. Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh. In fact  you find laughter throughout the mammals. It's been well described and well observed in primates  but you also see it in rats  and wherever you find it    humans  primates  rats    you find it associated with things like tickling. That's the same for humans. You find it associated with play  and all mammals play. And wherever you find it  it's associated with interactions. So Robert Provine  who has done a lot of work on this  has pointed out that you are    times  more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you're on your own  and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation. So if you ask human beings   When do you laugh   they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes. If you look at when they laugh  they're laughing with their friends. And when we laugh with people  we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes. You are laughing to show people that you understand them  that you agree with them  that you're part of the same group as them. You're laughing to show that you like them. You might even love them. You're doing all that at the same time as talking to them  and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you. Something that Robert Provine has pointed out  as you can see here  and the reason why we were laughing when we heard those funny laughs at the start  and why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing  is that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect. You can catch laughter from somebody else  and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them. So it's still modulated by this social context. You have to put humor to one side and think about the social  meaning of laughter because that's where its origins lie. Now  something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter  and we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have. So it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless  involuntary laughter  like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song  might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter  which isn't horrible laughter  but it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you  part of their interaction with you  they are choosing to do this. In our evolution  we have developed two different ways of vocalizing. Involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now. So we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots. So I've been looking at this in more detail. To do this  we've had to make recordings of people laughing  and we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh  and we got those same people to produce more posed  social laughter. So imagine your friend told a joke  and you're laughing because you like your friend  but not really because the joke's all that. So I'm going to play you  a couple of those. I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter  or if you think it's posed. So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter  What does that sound like to you  Audience  Posed. Sophie Scott  Posed  Posed. How about this one  I'm the best. Not really. No  that was helpless laughter  and in fact  to record that  all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at  and I just started doing this. What you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter. They seem to be different things to us. Interestingly  you see something quite similar with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled than if they're playing with each other  and we might be seeing something like that here  involuntary laughter  tickling laughter  being different from social laughter. They're acoustically very different. The real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch. When you start laughing hard  you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily. For example  I could never pitch my voice that high to sing. Also  you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds  all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy  or feels extremely easy to spot. In contrast  posed laughter  we might think it sounds a bit fake. Actually  it's not  it's actually an important social cue. We use it a lot  we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations  and it seems to be its own thing. So  for example  you find nasality in posed laughter  that kind of  ha ha ha ha ha  sound that you never get  you could not do  if you were laughing involuntarily. So they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things. We took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter. And when you do this  this is a really boring experiment. We just played people real and posed laughs. We didn't tell them it was a study on laughter. We put other sounds in there  to distract them  and all they're doing is lying listening to sounds. We don't tell them to do anything. Nonetheless  when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter  the brains are responding completely differently  significantly differently. What you see in the regions in blue  which lies in auditory cortex  are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs  and what seems to be the case  when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily  you hear sounds you would never hear in any other context. It's very unambiguous  and it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing of these novel sounds. In contrast  when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way  what you see are these regions in pink  which are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing  thinking about what somebody else is thinking. And I think what that means is  even if you're having your brain scanned  which is completely boring and not very interesting  when you hear somebody going   A ha ha ha ha ha   you're trying to work out why they're laughing. Laughter is always meaningful. You are always trying to understand it in context  even if  as far as you are concerned  at that point in time  it has not necessarily anything to do with you  you still want to know why those people are laughing. Now  we've had the opportunity to look  at how people hear real and posed laughter across the age range. So this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society  and here we just asked people two questions. First of all  they heard some laughs  and they had to say  how real  or posed do these laughs sound  The real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue. What you see is there is a rapid onset. As you get older  you get better and better at spotting real laughter. So six year olds are at chance  they can't really hear the difference. By the time you are older  you get better  but interestingly  you do not hit peak performance in this dataset until you are in your late   s and early   s. You don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty. You don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured at the end of your teens. You're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life. If we turn the question around and now say not  what does the laughter sound like in terms of being real or posed  but we say  how much does this laughter make you want to laugh  how contagious is this laughter to you  we see a different profile. And here  the younger you are  the more you want to join in when you hear laughter. Remember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on. You really can see this. Now everybody  young and old  finds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs  but as you get older  it all becomes  less contagious to you. Now  either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older  or it may mean that as you understand laughter better  and you are getting better at doing that  you need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh. You need the social stuff there. So we've got a very interesting behavior about which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect  but I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter than it's an important social emotion we should look at  because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter. There's a really lovely set of studies coming out from Robert Levenson's lab in California  where he's doing a longitudinal study with couples. He gets married couples  men and women  into the lab  and he gives them stressful conversations to have while he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed. So you've got the two of them in there  and he'll say to the husband   Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you.  And what you see is immediately    just run that one through your head briefly  you and your partner    you can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts. You can see physically  people become more stressed. What he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress with laughter  positive emotions like laughter  not only immediately become less stressed  they can see them physically feeling better  they're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together  they are also the couples that report high levels of satisfaction in their relationship and they stay together for longer. So in fact  when you look at close relationships  laughter is a phenomenally useful index of how people are regulating their emotions together. We're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other  we're making ourselves feel better together. Now  I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships. I think this is probably going to be a characteristic of close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends  which explains my next clip  which is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany on making a video to promote their heavy metal band  and it's extremely macho  and the mood is very serious  and I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter when things go wrong and how quickly that happens  and how that changes the mood. He's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on  got a towel. Ice. What might possibly happen  Video starts. Serious mood. And his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing  hard. He's not laughing yet. He's starting to go now. And now they're all off. They're on the floor. The thing I really like about that is it's all very serious until he jumps onto the ice  and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice  but also there isn't blood and bone everywhere  his friends start laughing. And imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going   No seriously  Heinrich  I think this is broken   we wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful. Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing  and his friends are going   Heinrich  I think we need to go to the hospital now   that also wouldn't be funny. The fact that the laughter works  it gets him from a painful  embarrassing  difficult situation  into a funny situation  into what we're  actually enjoying there  and I think that's  a really interesting use  and it's actually happening all the time. For example  I can remember something like this happening at my father's funeral. We weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants. We're not Canadian. These events are always difficult  I had a relative who was being a bit difficult  my mum was not in a good place  and I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started telling this story about something that happened in a     s sitcom  and I just thought at the time  I don't know why I'm doing this  and what I realized I was doing was I was coming up with something from somewhere I could use to make her laugh together with me. It was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this. We can laugh together. We're going to get through this. We're going to be okay. And in fact  all of us are doing this all the time. You do it so often  you don't even notice it. Everybody underestimates how often they laugh  and you're doing something  when you laugh with people  that's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system that mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds  and clearly to regulate emotions  to make ourselves feel better. It's not something specific to humans    it's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better. In other words  when it comes to laughter  you and me  baby  ain't nothing  but mammals.  Laughter  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  On the path that American children  travel to adulthood  two institutions oversee the journey. The first is the one we hear  a lot about  college. Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college. Some of you may be in college right now and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment. College has some shortcomings. It's expensive  it leaves young people in debt. But all in all  it's a pretty good path. Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge  about the world. And perhaps most importantly  a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there. Today I want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States. And that institution is prison. Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers. They're going to court dates instead of to class. Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility. And they're emerging from their   s not with degrees in business and English  but with criminal records. This institution is also costing us a lot  about        dollars a year to send a young person to prison in New Jersey. But here  taxpayers are footing the bill and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them when they come home and apply for work. There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past    years  our incarceration rate  has grown by     percent. I have one slide for this talk. Here it is. Here's our incarceration rate  about     people per         in the population. Here's the OECD countries. What's more  it's poor kids that we're sending to prison  too many drawn from African American and Latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it and the fulfillment of the American Dream. The problem's actually  a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending  poor kids to prison  we're saddling poor kids with court fees  with probation and parole restrictions  with low level warrants  we're asking them to live  in halfway houses and on house arrest  and we're asking them  to negotiate a police force that is entering poor communities of color  not for the purposes  of promoting public safety  but to make arrest counts  to line city coffers. This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment  young people worried that at any moment  they will be stopped  searched and seized. Not just in the streets   but in their homes  at school and at work. I got interested in this  other path to adulthood when I was myself a college student attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early     s. Penn sits within a historic  African American neighborhood. So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously  the kids attending  this elite  private university  and the kids from  the adjacent neighborhood  some of whom are making it to college  and many of whom  are being shipped to prison. In my sophomore year  I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school who lived about    minutes away from the university. Soon  her cousin came home  from a juvenile detention center. He was     a freshman in high school. I began to get to know him  and his friends and family  and I asked him what he thought  about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college. This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton and now a book. By the end of my sophomore year  I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age. The first week I spent in this neighborhood  I saw two boys  five and seven years old  play this game of chase  where the older boy ran after the other boy. He played the cop. When the cop caught up to the younger boy  he pushed him down  handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs  took a quarter out of  the other child's pocket  saying   I'm seizing that.  He asked the child if  he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant. Many times  I saw this game repeated  sometimes children would  simply give up running  and stick their bodies flat  against the ground with their hands above their heads  or flat up against a wall. Children would yell at each other   I'm going to lock you up  I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home   Once I saw a six year old child pull another child's pants down and try to do a cavity search. In the first    months that I lived in this neighborhood  I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors. So in the first    months  I watched the police stop  pedestrians or people in cars  search people  run people's names  chase people through the streets  pull people in for questioning  or make an arrest every single day  with five exceptions. Fifty two times  I watched the police break down doors  chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home. Fourteen times in this first year and a half  I watched the police punch  choke  kick  stomp on or beat young men after they had caught them. Bit by bit  I got to know two brothers  Chuck and Tim. Chuck was    when we met  a senior in high school. He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's. His younger brother  Tim  was   . And Tim loved Chuck  he followed him around a lot  looked to Chuck to be a mentor. They lived with their mom and grandfather in a two story row home  with a front lawn and a back porch. Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up. She never really was able  to hold down a job for very long. It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family  not really enough to pay for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys. The family was really struggling. So when we met  Chuck was a senior in high school. He had just turned   . That winter  a kid in the schoolyard called Chuck's mom a crack whore. Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow and the school cops charged him  with aggravated assault. The other kid was fine the next day  I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything. But anyway  since Chuck was     this agg. assault case sent him  to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia  where he sat  unable to pay the bail    he couldn't afford it    while the trial dates  dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year. Finally  near the end of this season  the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges and Chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head. Tim was pretty happy that day. The next fall  Chuck tried  to re enroll as a senior  but the school secretary told him that he was then    and too old  to be readmitted. Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn't pay  the     dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after the case ended. Then he was a high school dropout living on the run. Tim's first arrest came later that year after he turned   . Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan for the court fees and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car. So a cop pulls them over  runs the car  and the car comes up  as stolen in California. Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen. His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction in northeast Philly. Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri state  let alone to California. But anyway  the cops down at the precinct charged Chuck with  receiving stolen property. And then a juvenile judge   a few days later  charged Tim  age     with accessory to receiving a stolen property and then he was placed on  three years of probation. With this probation sentence  hanging over his head  Chuck sat his little brother down and began teaching him how to run from the police. They would sit side by side  on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars  how to negotiate a late night police raid  how and where to hide. I want you to imagine for a second what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college  not prison. A neighborhood like the one  I got to grow up in. Okay  you might say. But Chuck and Tim  kids like them  they're committing crimes  Don't they deserve to be in prison  Don't they deserve to be  living in fear of arrest  Well  my answer would be no. They don't. And certainly not for the same things  that other young people with more privilege are doing with impunity. If Chuck had gone to my high school  that schoolyard fight  would have ended there  as a schoolyard fight. It never would have become an aggravated assault case. Not a single kid that I went to college with has a criminal record right now. Not a single one. But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class  Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night  Okay  you might say. But doesn't this high incarceration rate partly account for our  really low crime rate  Crime is down. That's a good thing. Totally  that is a good thing. Crime is down. It dropped precipitously in the '  s and through the     s. But according to a committee of academics convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year  the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky. It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down irrespective of how many young people we send to prison. We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way  good and bad  innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being  wrongfully convicted. So if you're convicted  of something you did do  you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people  there are victims and  there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that. Right now  we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods  who have the least amount of family resources  who are attending  the country's worst schools  who are facing the toughest time in the labor market  who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem  we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line    to basically never do anything wrong. Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges  Why are we offering only handcuffs  jail time and this fugitive existence  Can we imagine something better  Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery  prevention  civic inclusion  rather than punishment  A criminal justice system  that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions. And finally  a criminal justice system that believes in black young people  rather than treating black young people  as the enemy to be rounded up. The good news is that we already are. A few years ago  Michelle Alexander wrote  The New Jim Crow   which got Americans to see  incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before. President Obama and Attorney General  Eric Holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform  on the need to address  racial disparity in incarceration. We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk as the civil rights violation that it is. We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana. New York  New Jersey and California have been dropping their  prison populations  closing prisons  while also seeing a big drop in crime. Texas has gotten into the game now  also closing prisons   investing in education. This curious coalition is building  from the right and the left  made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives  of civil rights activists and libertarians  of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers  and older  wealthier people    some of you are here in the audience    pumping big money into  decarceration initiatives In a deeply divided Congress  the work of reforming  our criminal justice system is just about the only thing that the right and the left are coming together on. I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime. I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically  high incarceration rates did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime. The question for us now is  how much can we make of it  How much can we change  I want to end with a call to young people  the young people attending college and the young people struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison and return home. It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart  but the young people participating in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood  they have one thing in common  Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system. Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights  the fight for more people  to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom. The mission for the generation  of young people coming of age in this  a sea change moment  potentially  is to end mass incarceration and  build a new criminal justice system  emphasis on the word justice. Thanks. I am a plant geneticist. I study genes that make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of stress. In recent years  millions of people around the world have come to believe that there's something sinister about genetic modification. Today  I am going to provide a different perspective. First  let me introduce my husband  Raoul. He's an organic farmer. On his farm  he plants a variety of different crops. This is one of the many ecological farming practices he uses to keep his farm healthy. Imagine some of the reactions we get   Really  An organic farmer and a plant geneticist  Can you agree on anything   Well  we can  and it's not difficult  because we have the same goal. We want to help nourish the growing population without further destroying the environment. I believe this is the greatest challenge of our time. Now  genetic modification is not new  virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. Let me give you a few examples. On the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn. You see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case. Unless you have a hammer  teosinte isn't good for making tortillas. Now  take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana. You can see the large seeds. And unappetizing brussel sprouts  and eggplant  so beautiful. Now  to create these varieties  breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years. Some of them are quite creative  like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting to create this variety that's half tomato and half potato. Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques  such as random mutagenesis  which induces uncharacterized mutations into the plants. The rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach. Now  today  breeders have even more options to choose from. Some of them are extraordinarily precise. I want to give you a couple examples from my own work. I work on rice  which is a staple food for more than half the world's people. Each year     percent of the potential harvest is lost to pest and disease. For this reason  farmers plant rice varieties that carry genes for resistance. This approach has been used for nearly     years. Yet  when I started graduate school  no one knew what these genes were. It wasn't until the     s that scientists finally uncovered the genetic basis of resistance. In my laboratory  we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa. We found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that's normally susceptible  and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to infection. Now  the same month that my laboratory published our discovery on the rice immunity gene  my friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office. He said   Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice.  That's because their fields are flooded  and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day. Although rice grows well in standing water  most rice varieties will die if they're submerged for more than three days. Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes. He told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property. It could withstand two weeks of complete submergence. He asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene. I said yes    I was very excited  because I knew if we were successful  we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded. Kenong spent    years looking for this gene. Then one day  he said   Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it.  I went to the greenhouse and I saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for    days had died  but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered  called Sub   was alive. Kenong and I were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect. But this is just a greenhouse experiment. Would this work in the field  Now  I'm going to show you a four month time lapse video taken at the International Rice Research Institute. Breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub  gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding. On the left  you can see the Sub  variety  and on the right is the conventional variety. Both varieties do very well at first  but then the field is flooded for    days. You can see the Sub  variety does great. In fact  it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety. I love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers. Last year  with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  three and a half million farmers grew Sub  rice. Thank you. Now  many people don't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around  rice genes in rice plants  or even when it comes to mixing species together through grafting or random mutagenesis. But when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants  a lot of people say   Yuck.  Why would you do that  The reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest  safest  and most effective technology for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture. I'm going to give you three examples. First  take a look at papaya. It's delicious  right  But now  look at this papaya. This papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus. In the     s  this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Many people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed  but then  a local Hawaiian  a plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves  decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering. He took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it into the papaya genome. This is kind of like a human getting a vaccination. Now  take a look at his field trial. You can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center. It's immune to infection. The conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus. Dennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry. Today     years later  there's still no other method to control this disease. There's no organic method. There's no conventional method. Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered. Now  some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food  but consider this  The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus. If you bite into an organic or conventional papaya that is infected with the virus  you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein. Now  take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant. The brown you see is frass  what comes out the back end of the insect. To control this serious pest  which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh  Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides two to three times a week  sometimes twice a day  when pest pressure is high. But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health  especially when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection  like these children. In less developed countries  it's estimated that         people die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure. Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach. Organic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.  which is based on a bacteria. This pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests  and in fact  it's nontoxic to humans  fish and birds. It's less toxic than table salt. But this approach does not work well in Bangladesh. That's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find  they're expensive  and they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants. In the genetic approach  scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome. Will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh  Definitely. Last season  farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use by a huge amount  almost down to zero. They're able to harvest and replant for the next season. Now  I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides. My final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition. In less developed countries          children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A. More than half will die. For this reason  scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation genetically engineered a golden rice to produce beta carotene  which is the precursor of Vitamin A. This is the same pigment that we find in carrots. Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day will save the lives of thousands of children. But golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification. Just last year  activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines. When I heard about the destruction  I wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project  that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives. Some of my friends and family still worry  How do you know genes in the food are safe to eat  I explained the genetic engineering  the process of moving genes between species  has been used for more than    years in wines  in medicine  in plants  in cheeses. In all that time  there hasn't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment. But I say  look  I'm not asking you to believe me. Science is not a belief system. My opinion doesn't matter. Let's look at the evidence. After    years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists  every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification. These are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines. Raoul and I believe that  instead of worrying about the genes in our food  we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy. We must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive  and if everyone can afford the food. We must try to minimize environmental degradation. What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation about plant genetics is that the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat. We have a huge challenge in front of us. Let's celebrate scientific innovation and use it. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering and safeguard the environment. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Powerfully argued. The people who argue against GMOs  as I understand it  the core piece comes from two things. One  complexity and unintended consequence. Nature is this incredibly complex machine. If we put out these brand new genes that we've created  that haven't been challenged by years of evolution  and they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on  couldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem  especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there  The fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds  and even if it was  that there would be unintended consequences. How do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence  Often our tinkerings with nature do lead to big  unintended consequences and chain reactions. Pamela Ronald  Okay  so on the commercial aspects  one thing that's really important to understand is that  in the developed world  farmers in the United States  almost all farmers  whether they're organic or conventional  they buy seed produced by seed companies. So there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed  but hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy. It's different in the less developed world. Farmers there cannot afford the seed. These seeds are not being sold. These seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification groups  so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available. CA  Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy  This is the heroin strategy. You seed the stuff  and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever  PR  There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure  but it doesn't work that way. For example  the seed that's being distributed  the flood tolerant rice  this is distributed freely through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies  so there's no commercial interest at all. The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation. Again  it's being freely distributed. There are no commercial profits in this situation. And now to address your other question about  well  mixing genes  aren't there some unintended consequences  Absolutely    every time we do something different  there's an unintended consequence  but one of the points I was trying to make is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants  mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis. This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations  and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence than many of the modern methods. And so it's really important not to use the term GMO because it's scientifically meaningless. I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product  and think about the needs of the consumer. CA  So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model in a lot of people that nature is nature  and it's pure and pristine  and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian. It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way  and I think you're saying that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is. Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway. PR  That's absolutely true  and there's no such thing as pure food. I mean  you could not spray eggplant with insecticides or not genetically engineer it  but then you'd be stuck eating frass. So there's no purity there. CA  Pam Ronald  thank you.  That was powerfully argued. PR  Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Most of us think of motion as a very visual thing. If I walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while I speak  that motion is something that you can see. But there's a world of important motion that's too subtle for the human eye  and over the past few years  we've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can't. So let me show you what I mean. On the left here  you see video of a person's wrist  and on the right  you see video of a sleeping infant  but if I didn't tell you that these were videos  you might assume that you were looking at two regular images  because in both cases  these videos appear to be almost completely still. But there's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here  and if you were to touch the wrist on the left  you would feel a pulse  and if you were to hold the infant on the right  you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath. And these motions carry a lot of significance  but they're usually too subtle for us to see  so instead  we have to observe them through direct contact  through touch. But a few years ago  my colleagues at MIT developed what they call a motion microscope  which is software that finds these subtle motions in video and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see. And so  if we use their software on the left video  it lets us see the pulse in this wrist  and if we were to count that pulse  we could even figure out this person's heart rate. And if we used the same software on the right video  it lets us see each breath that this infant takes  and we can use this as a contact free way to monitor her breathing. And so this technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively. So a couple years ago  I started working with the folks that created that software  and we decided to pursue a crazy idea. We thought  it's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this  and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch. But what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear  What if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound  which are just another kind of motion  and turn everything that we see into a microphone  Now  this is a bit of a strange idea  so let me try to put it in perspective for you. Traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal  and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio. But sound causes all objects to vibrate. Those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see. So what if we record them with a high speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video  and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them  This would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance. And so we tried this out  and here's one of our experiments  where we took this potted plant that you see on the right and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound. And so here's the video that we recorded  and we recorded it at thousands of frames per second  but even if you look very closely  all you'll see are some leaves that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing  because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer. That's one ten thousandth of a centimeter  which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in this image. So you can squint all you want  but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible. But it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant  because with the right algorithms  we can take this silent  seemingly still video and we can recover this sound. So how is this possible  How can we get so much information out of so little motion  Well  let's say that those leaves move by just a single micrometer  and let's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel. That may not seem like much  but a single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it  and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image  then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant. On a personal note  we were pretty psyched when we figured this out. But even with the right algorithm  we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle. You see  there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well this technique will work. There's the object and how far away it is  there's the camera and the lens that you use  how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is. And even with the right algorithm  we had to be very careful with our early experiments  because if we got any of these factors wrong  there was no way to tell what the problem was. We would just get noise back. And so a lot of our early experiments looked like this. And so here I am  and on the bottom left  you can kind of see our high speed camera  which is pointed at a bag of chips  and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps. And like I said  we had to be very careful in these early experiments  so this is how it went down. Mary had a little lamb  Little lamb  Little lamb  AD  So this experiment looks completely ridiculous. I mean  I'm screaming at a bag of chips    and we're blasting it with so much light  we literally melted the first bag we tried this on.  Laughter  But ridiculous as this experiment looks  it was actually really important  because we were able to recover this sound. AD  And this was really significant  because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object. And so it gave us this point of reference  and gradually we could start to modify the experiment  using different objects or moving the object further away  using less light or quieter sounds. And we analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique  because once we understood those limits  we could figure out how to push them. And that led to experiments like this one  where again  I'm going to speak to a bag of chips  but this time we've moved our camera about    feet away  outside  behind a soundproof window  and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight. And so here's the video that we captured. And this is what things sounded like from inside  next to the bag of chips. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And here's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window. and everywhere that Mary went  that lamb was sure to go. AD  And there are other ways that we can push these limits as well. So here's a quieter experiment where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer  and in this case  our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones  and we were able to do this so well that I could even Shazam our results. And we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use. Because the experiments I've shown you so far were done with a camera  a high speed camera  that can record video about a     times faster than most cell phones  but we've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras  and we do that by taking advantage of what's called a rolling shutter. You see  most cameras record images one row at a time  and so if an object moves during the recording of a single image  there's a slight time delay between each row  and this causes slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video. And so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts  we can actually recover sound using a modified version of our algorithm. So here's an experiment we did where we filmed a bag of candy while a nearby loudspeaker played the same  Mary Had a Little Lamb  music from before  but this time  we used just a regular store bought camera  and so in a second  I'll play for you the sound that we recovered  and it's going to sound distorted this time  but listen and see if you can still recognize the music. And so  again  that sounds distorted  but what's really amazing here is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a Best Buy. So at this point  a lot of people see this work  and they immediately think about surveillance. And to be fair  it's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone. But keep in mind that there's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance. In fact  people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades. But what's really new here  what's really different  is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object  which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world  and we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate  but also about the object itself. And so I want to take a step back and think about how that might change the ways that we use video  because we usually use video to look at things  and I've just shown you how we can use it to listen to things. But there's another important way that we learn about the world  that's by interacting with it. We push and pull and poke and prod things. We shake things and see what happens. And that's something that video still won't let us do  at least not traditionally. So I want to show you some new work  and this is based on an idea I had just a few months ago  so this is actually the first time I've shown it to a public audience. And the basic idea is that we're going to use the vibrations in a video to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them and see how they react to us. So here's an object  and in this case  it's a wire figure in the shape of a human  and we're going to film that object with just a regular camera. So there's nothing special about this camera. In fact  I've actually done this with my cell phone before. But we do want to see the object vibrate  so to make that happen  we're just going to bang a little bit on the surface where it's resting while we record this video. So that's it  just five seconds of regular video  while we bang on this surface  and we're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object  and we're going to use that information to create something new and interactive. And so here's what we've created. And it looks like a regular image  but this isn't an image  and it's not a video  because now I can take my mouse and I can start interacting with the object. And so what you see here is a simulation of how this object would respond to new forces that we've never seen before  and we created it from just five seconds of regular video. And so this is a really powerful way to look at the world  because it lets us predict how objects will respond to new situations  and you could imagine  for instance  looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen  how would that bridge hold up if I were to drive my car across it. And that's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge. And of course  there are going to be limitations to this technique  just like there were with the visual microphone  but we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect  especially if you give it longer videos. So for example  here's a video that I captured of a bush outside of my apartment  and I didn't do anything to this bush  but by capturing a minute long video  a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation. And so you could imagine giving this to a film director  and letting him control  say  the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it's been recorded. Or  in this case  we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain  and you can't even see any motion in this video  but by recording a two minute long video  natural air currents in this room created enough subtle  imperceptible motions and vibrations that we could learn enough to create this simulation. And ironically  we're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects  when it comes to video games and  D models  but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple  regular video  is something new that has a lot of potential. So here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects. And what I've shown you today is only the beginning. We've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging  because it gives us a new way to capture our surroundings with common  accessible technology. And so looking to the future  it's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world. Thank you. You may not realize this  but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy. This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health  and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers. Now  the diagram that you see here  I know it looks like some kind of sports play  but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed. And like writing software  we can print and write DNA into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria. What this program does is produces fluorescent proteins in a rhythmic fashion and generates a small molecule that allows bacteria to communicate and synchronize  as you're seeing in this movie. The growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair. Now  what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules  and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off. And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale  but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast  in larger colonies of bacteria  this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other  and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen. Now  our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing  in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density. You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie  where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density. Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards. This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova  because it looks like an exploding star. Now  besides programming these beautiful patterns  I wondered  what else can we get these bacteria to do  And I decided to explore how we can program bacteria to detect and treat diseases in our bodies like cancer. One of the surprising facts about bacteria is that they can naturally grow inside of tumors. This happens because typically tumors are areas where the immune system has no access  and so bacteria find these tumors and use them as a safe haven to grow and thrive. We started using probiotic bacteria which are safe bacteria that have a health benefit  and found that when orally delivered to mice  these probiotics would selectively grow inside of liver tumors. We realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics  and hence  the presence of the tumors  was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine  and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer. We went on to show that this technology could sensitively and specifically detect liver cancer  one that is challenging to detect otherwise. Now  since these bacteria specifically localize to tumors  we've been programming them to not only detect cancer but also to treat cancer by producing therapeutic molecules from within the tumor environment that shrink the existing tumors  and we've been doing this using quorum sensing programs like you saw in the previous movies. Altogether  imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer  or even other diseases. Our ability to program bacteria and program life opens up new horizons in cancer research  and to share this vision  I worked with artist Vik Muniz to create the symbol of the universe  made entirely out of bacteria or cancer cells. Ultimately  my hope is that the beauty and purpose of this microscopic universe can inspire new and creative approaches for the future of cancer research. Thank you. In June of       Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head  North Carolina for France. That's her boat  the American Pearl. It's    feet long and just six feet across at its widest point. The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F     pickup truck. Tori and her friends built it by hand  and it weighed about       pounds. Her plan was to row it alone across the Atlantic Ocean    no motor  no sail    something no woman and no American had ever done before. This would be her route  over       miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean. Professionally  Tori worked as a project administrator for the city of Louisville  Kentucky  her hometown  but her real passion was exploring. This was not her first big expedition. Several years earlier  she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole. She was an accomplished rower in college  even competed for a spot on the      U.S. Olympic team  but this  this was different. Sector time   a.m. So that's Kentucky time now. Dawn Landes  Tori made these videos as she rowed. This is her   st day at sea. At this point  she'd covered over       miles  had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following a storm that disabled all her long range communications systems just five days in. Most days looked like this. At this point  she'd rowed over         strokes  fighting the current and the wind. Some days  she traveled as little as    feet. Yeah. And as frustrating as those days were  other days were like this. DL  She saw fish  dolphins  whales  sharks  and even some sea turtles. After two weeks with no human contact  Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio. Man  Heading up to a low ahead of you but it's heading  and you're obviously going northeast and there's a high behind us. That'd be coming east northeast also. TMM  Good. DL  She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point. is going to happen soon. DL  What the weather report didn't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic. There's a very strong wind from the east now. It's blowing about. It's blowing  After    days of storm I get to row for four hours without a flagging wind. I'm not very happy right now. As happy as I was this morning  I am unhappy now  so ... DL  After nearly three months at sea  she'd covered over       miles. She was two thirds of the way there  but in the storm  the waves were the size of a seven story building. Her boat kept capsizing. Some of them were pitchpole capsizes  flipping her end over end  and rowing became impossible. I'm in something big  bad and ugly. Two capsizes. Last capsize  I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back. I've had about six capsizes now. The last one was a pitchpole. I have the Argus beacon with me. I would set off the distress signal  but quite frankly  I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat. It's so far underwater right now  the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin. It's about    a.m. I've lost track of the number of capsizes. I seem to capsize about every    minutes. I think I may have broken my left arm. The waves are tearing the boat to shreds. I keep praying because I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this. DL  Tori set off her distress beacon and was rescued by a passing container ship. They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France. I read about it in the newspaper. In       I was a high school student living in Louisville  Kentucky. Now  I live in New York City. I'm a songwriter. And her bravery stuck with me  and I'm adapting her story into a musical called  Row.  When Tori returned home  she was feeling disheartened  she was broke. She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization. In this scene  she sits at home. The phone is ringing  her friends are calling  but she doesn't know how to talk to them. She sings this song. It's called  Dear Heart.  When I was dreaming  I took my body to beautiful places I'd never been. I saw Gibraltar  and stars of Kentucky burned in the moonlight  making me smile. And when I awoke here  the sky was so cloudy. I walked to a party where people I know try hard to know me and ask where I've been  but I can't explain what I've seen to them. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh ooh ooh  ah ah ah ah ah. Ah ah  ah ah ah. When I was out there  the ocean would hold me  rock me and throw me  light as a child. But now I'm so heavy  nothing consoles me. My mind floats like driftwood  wayward and wild. Ah  listen  dear heart. Just pay attention  go right from the start. Ah  listen  dear heart. You can fall off the map  but don't fall apart. Ooh. Eventually  Tori starts to get her feet under her. She starts hanging out with her friends again. She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time. She gets a new job working for another Louisville native  Muhammad Ali. One day  at lunch with her new boss  Tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid Atlantic  to do something that she almost died trying to do. His response was classic Ali   You don't want to go through life as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean.  He was right. Tori rebuilt the American Pearl  and in December of       she did it. Thank you. These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley  California. Until last year  I'd never kept bees before  but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them  and I decided  to be able to take compelling images  I should start keeping bees myself. And as you may know  bees pollinate one third of our food crops  and lately they've been having a really hard time. So as a photographer  I wanted to explore what this problem really looks like. So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. This furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell  and bees right now are dealing with several different problems  including pesticides  diseases  and habitat loss  but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia  Varroa destructor. And this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood. This eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees  and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease. Now  bees are the most sensitive when they're developing inside their brood cells  and I wanted to know what that process really looks like  so I teamed up with a bee lab at U.C. Davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera. I'm going to show you the first    days of a bee's life condensed into    seconds. This is a bee egg as it hatches into a larva  and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them. Then  their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae. Here's that same pupation process  and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells. Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes. The last step of the process is their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair. So     Applause  As you can see halfway through that video  the mites were running around on the baby bees  and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals. In the long run  that's bad news  so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites. This is one of those alternatives. It's an experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge  and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program. Now  the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites  so they set out to breed a line of mite resistant bees. This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab. The virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument. Now  this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed  but there's a tradeoff in having this much control. They succeeded in breeding mite resistant bees  but in that process  those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey  so to overcome that problem  these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers. This is Bret Adee opening one of his        beehives. He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world  and the USDA is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time  they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us. And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees  and the truth is  we've been doing that for thousands of years. We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box  practically domesticating it  and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey  but over time we started losing our native pollinators  our wild pollinators  and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture  so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system. So when people talk about saving bees  my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees  and in order to design new solutions  we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we sometimes cannot see. In other words  we have to understand bees up close. Thank you. When I was nine years old  my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like  and I drew this fairy mushroom. And then she actually built it. I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time  and maybe I still haven't  because I'm still designing houses. This is a six story bespoke home on the island of Bali. It's built almost entirely from bamboo. The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor. You enter the house by a bridge. It can get hot in the tropics  so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes. But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out. This room we left open. We made an air conditioned  tented bed. And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room. Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right  so instead  we made this giant woven pod. Now  we do have all the necessary luxuries  like bathrooms. This one is a basket in the corner of the living room  and I've got tell you  some people actually hesitate to use it. We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation. So there are lots of things that we're still working on  but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right. It's actually a wild grass. It grows on otherwise unproductive land    deep ravines  mountainsides. It lives off of rainwater  spring water  sunlight  and of the       species of bamboo that grow across the world  we use just seven of them. That's my dad. He's the one who got me building with bamboo  and he is standing in a clump of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago. Each year  it sends up a new generation of shoots. That shoot  we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week  so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years. Now  we harvest from hundreds of family owned clumps. Betung  as we call it  it's really long  up to    meters of usable length. Try getting that truck down the mountain. And it's strong  it has the tensile strength of steel  the compressive strength of concrete. Slam four tons straight down on a pole  and it can take it. Because it's hollow  it's lightweight  light enough to be lifted by just a few men  or  apparently  one woman. And when my father built Green School in Bali  he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus  because he saw it as a promise. It's a promise to the kids. It's one sustainable material that they will not run out of. And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago  I just thought  this makes perfect sense. It is growing all around us. It's strong. It's elegant. It's earthquake resistant. Why hasn't this happened sooner  and what can we do with it next  So along with some of the original builders of Green School  I founded Ibuku. Ibu means  mother   and ku means  mine   so it represents my Mother Earth  and at Ibuku  we are a team of artisans  architects and designers  and what we're doing together is creating a new way of building. Over the past five years together  we have built over    unique structures  most of them in Bali. Nine of them are at Green Village    you've just seen inside some of these homes    and we fill them with bespoke furniture  we surround them with veggie gardens  we would love to invite you all to come visit someday. And while you're there  you can also see Green School    we keep building classrooms there each year    as well as an updated fairy mushroom house. We're also working on a little house for export. This is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated  right down to the details and textiles. A restaurant with an open air kitchen. It looks a lot like a kitchen  right  And a bridge that spans    meters across a river. Now  what we're doing  it's not entirely new. From little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java  bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years. There are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts. But until recently  it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects  and so  just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone. Unprotected bamboo weathers. Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust. And so that's why most people  especially in Asia  think that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house. And so we thought  what will it take to change their minds  to convince people that bamboo is worth building with  much less worth aspiring to  First  we needed safe treatment solutions. Borax is a natural salt. It turns bamboo into a viable building material. Treat it properly  design it carefully  and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime. Second  build something extraordinary out of it. Inspire people. Fortunately  Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship. It values the artisan. So combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers  and always remember that you are designing for curving  tapering  hollow poles. No two poles alike  no straight lines  no two by fours here. The tried and true  well crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here. We have had to invent our own rules. We ask the bamboo what it's good at  what it wants to become  and what it says is  respect it  design for its strengths  protect it from water  and to make the most of its curves. So we design in real  D  making scale structural models out of the same material that we'll later use to build the house. And bamboo model making  it's an art  as well as some hardcore engineering. So that's the blueprint of the house. And we bring it to site  and with tiny rulers  we measure each pole  and consider each curve  and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house on site. When it comes down to the details  we consider everything. Why are doors so often rectangular  Why not round  How could you make a door better  Well  its hinges battle with gravity  and gravity will always win in the end  so why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced  And while you're at it  why not doors shaped like teardrops  To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material  we have really had to push ourselves  and within that constraint  we have found space for something new. It's a challenge  how do you make a ceiling if you don't have any flat boards to work with  Let me tell you  sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood. But if what you've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little splits  weave that ceiling together  stretch a canvas over it  lacquer it. How do you design durable kitchen countertops that do justice to this curving structure you've just built  Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread  hand carve each to fit the other  leave the crusts on  and what we're doing  it is almost entirely handmade. The structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by steel joints  but we use a lot of hand whittled bamboo pins. There are thousands of pins in each floor. This floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin. You can feel the texture under bare feet. And the floor that you walk on  can it affect the way that you walk  Can it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world  I remember being nine years old and feeling wonder  and possibility  and a little bit of idealism. And we've got a really long way to go  there's a lot left to learn  but one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment  you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will grow back. Thank you. I know what you're thinking   Why does that guy get to sit down   That's because this is radio. I tell radio stories about design  and I report on all kinds of stories  buildings and toothbrushes and mascots and wayfinding and fonts. My mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about so they begin to pay attention to all forms of design. When you decode the world with design intent in mind  the world becomes kind of magical. Instead of seeing the broken things  you see all the little bits of genius that anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better. And that's essentially the definition of design  making life better and providing joy. And few things give me greater joy than a well designed flag. Yeah  Happy   th anniversary on your flag  Canada. It is beautiful  gold standard. Love it. I'm kind of obsessed with flags. Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags  and people are like   I don't care about flags   and then we start talking about flags  and trust me      percent of people care about flags. There's just something about them that works on our emotions. My family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year  including the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland. I put this picture online  and sure enough  within the first few minutes  someone left a comment that said   You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass.   Laughter  Which    see  people are passionate about flags  you know  That's the way it is. What I love about flags is that once you understand the design of flags  what makes a good flag  what makes a bad flag  you can understand the design of almost anything. So what I'm going to do here is  I cracked open an episode of my radio show       Invisible   and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage  so when I press a button over here    Voice  S for Sound    Roman Mars  It's going to make a sound  and so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music  it's because I pressed a button. Voice  Sssssound. RM  All right  got it  Here we go. Three  two. This is     Invisible. I'm Roman Mars. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Roman Mars  According to the North American Vexillological Association. Vexillological. Ted Kaye  Vexillology is the study of flags. RM  It's that extra  lol  that makes it sound weird. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. RM  Before I moved to Chicago in       I didn't even know cities had their own flags. TK  Most larger cities do have flags. RM  Well  I didn't know that. That's Ted Kaye  by the way. TK  Hello. RM  He's a flag expert. He's a totally awesome guy. TK  I'm Ted Kaye. I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies  and I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association and the North American Vexillological Association. RM  Ted literally wrote the book on flag design. Narrator   Good Flag  Bad Flag.  RM  It's more of a pamphlet  really. It's about    pages. TK  Yes  it's called  Good Flag  Bad Flag  How to Design a Great Flag.  RM  And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago is a beaut  white field  two horizontal blue stripes  and four six pointed red stars down the middle. Narrator  Number two  use meaningful symbolism. TK  The blue stripes represent the water  the river and the lake. Narrator  The flag's images  colors or pattern should relate to what it symbolizes. TK  The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history. RM  Namely  the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago  the Great Chicago Fire  the World Columbian Exposition  which everyone remembers because of the White City  and the Century of Progress Exposition  which no one remembers at all. Narrator  Number three  use two to three basic colors. TK  The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set  red  white  blue  green  yellow and black. RM  The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy in with an entire cross section of the city. It is everywhere  every municipal building flies the flag. Whet Moser  Like  there's probably at least one store on every block near where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia. RM  That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine. WM  Today  just for example  I went to get a haircut  and when I sat down in the barber's chair  there was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in  and then in the mirror there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me. When I left  a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack. RM  It's adaptable and remixable. The six pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places. WM  The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it. RM  It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride. TK  When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago  often it's not the flag of the  United States on his casket. It can be the flag of the city of Chicago. That's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago. RM  And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag. I also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool. TK  A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride. RM  Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in       I researched its flag  because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there. And I found it  I am sorry to say  sadly lacking. I know. It hurts me  too. TK  Well  let me start from the top. Narrator  Number one  keep it simple. TK  Keeping it simple. Narrator  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory. TK  It's a relatively complex flag. RM  Okay  here we go. Okay. The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the     s. TK  A powerful symbol for San Francisco. RM  I still don't really dig the phoenix. Design wise  it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time  which if you were trying for that  you wouldn't be able to do it  and it just looks bad at a distance  but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column. Behind the phoenix  the background is mostly white  and then it has a substantial gold border around it. TK  Which is a very attractive design element. RM  I think it's okay. But     Laughter     here come the big no nos of flag design. Narrator  Number four  no lettering or seals. Never use writing of any kind. RM  Underneath the phoenix  there's a motto on a ribbon that translates to  Gold in peace  iron in war   plus    and this is the big problem    it says San Francisco across the bottom. TK  If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag  your symbolism has failed. RM  The United States flag doesn't say  USA  across the front. In fact  country flags  they tend to behave. Like  hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel and Somalia and Japan and Gambia. There's a bunch of really great country flags  but they obey good design principles because the stakes are high. They're on the international stage. But city  state and regional flags are another story. There is a scourge of bad flags  and they must be stopped. That is the truth and that is the dare. The first step is to recognize that we have a problem. A lot of people tend to think that good design is just a matter of taste  and quite honestly  sometimes it is  actually  but sometimes it isn't  all right  Here's the full list of NAVA flag design principles. Narrator  The five basic principles of flag design. Number one. TK  Keep it simple. Narrator  Number two. TK  Use meaningful symbolism. Narrator  Number three. TK  Use two to three basic colors. Narrator  Number four. TK  No lettering or seals. Narrator  Never use writing of any kind. TK  Because you can't read that at a distance. Narrator  Number five. TK  And be distinctive. RM  All the best flags tend to stick to these principles. And like I said before  most country flags are okay. But here's the thing  if you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything  they would say these principles    simplicity  deep meaning  having few colors or being thoughtful about colors  uniqueness  don't have  writing you can't read    all those principles apply to them  too. But sadly  good design principles are rarely invoked in U.S. city flags. Our biggest problem seems to be that fourth one. We just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags  or little municipal seals with tiny writing on them. Here's the thing about municipal seals  They were designed to be on pieces of paper where you can read them  not on flags     feet away flapping in the breeze. So here's a bunch of flags again. Vexillologists call these SOBs  seals on a bedsheet     Laughter     and if you can't tell what city they go to  yeah  that's exactly the problem  except for Anaheim  apparently. They fixed it.  Laughter  These flags are everywhere in the U.S. The European equivalent of the municipal seal is the city coat of arms  and this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right. So this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam. Now  if this were a United States city  the flag would probably look like this. You know  yeah.  Laughter  But instead  the flag of Amsterdam looks like this. Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing  Amsterdam  below it  they just take the key elements of the escutcheon  the shield  and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world. And because it's so badass  those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam  just like Chicago  they're used. Even though seal on a bedsheet flags are particularly painful and offensive to me  nothing can quite prepare you for one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history. Are you ready  It's the flag of Milwaukee  Wisconsin. I mean  it's distinctive  I'll give them that. Steve Kodis  It was adopted in     . RM  The city ran a contest and gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs. SK  And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan cobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag. RM  It's a kitchen sink flag. There's a gigantic gear representing industry  there's a ship recognizing the port  a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry. It's a hot mess  and Steve Kodis  a graphic designer from Milwaukee  wants to change it. SK  It's really awful. It's a misstep on the city's behalf  to say the least. RM  But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top  almost to the point of self parody  is on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment. SK  So that's the final element in it that just makes it that much more ridiculous  that there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag. RM  On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.  Laughter  Yeah. Now  Milwaukee is a fantastic city. I've been there. I love it. The most depressing part of this flag  though  is that there have been two major redesign contests. The last one was held in     . One hundred and five entries were received. TK  But in the end  the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board decided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city. RM  They couldn't agree to change that thing   Laughter  That's discouraging enough  to make you think that good design and democracy just simply do not go together. But Steve Kotas is going to try one more time to redesign the Milwaukee flag. SK  I believe Milwaukee is a great city. Every great city deserves a great flag. RM  Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet. One of the things about proposing one of these things is you have to get people on board  and then you reveal your design. But here's the trick  If you want to design a great flag  a kickass flag like Chicago's or D.C.'s  which also has a great flag  start by drawing a one by one and a half  inch rectangle on a piece of paper. Your design has to fit within that tiny rectangle. Here's why. TK  A three by five foot flag on a pole     feet away looks about the same size as a one by one and a half inch rectangle seen about    inches from your eye. You'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be when you hold yourself to that limitation. RM  Meanwhile  back in San Francisco. Is there anything we can do  TK  I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.  Laughter  The way to make  San Francisco's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance. Take the name off  and the border might even be made thicker  so it's more a part of the flag. And I would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag. RM  But the current phoenix  that's got to go. TK  I would simplify or stylize the phoenix. Depict a big  wide winged bird coming out of flames. Emphasize those flames. RM  So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero based on Ted Kaye's suggestions. I don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered and didn't follow those guidelines. Fans of my radio show and podcast  they've heard me complain about bad flags. They've sent me other suggested designs. This one's by Neil Mussett. Both are so much better. And I think if they were adopted  I would see them around the city. In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful  many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted. If you see your city flag and like it  fly it  even if it violates  a design rule or two. I don't care. But if you don't see your city flag  maybe it doesn't exist  but maybe it does  and it just sucks  and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that. As we move more and more into cities  the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place  but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself  especially today  as the populace is becoming more design aware. And I think design awareness is at an all time high. A well designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all of its design systems  its public transit  its parks  its signage. It might seem frivolous  but it's not. TK  Often when city leaders say   We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag   my response is   If you had a great city flag  you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things.  RM  I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do in the case of Chicago. The marriage of good design and civic pride is something that we need in all places. The best part about municipal flags is that we own them. They are an open source  publicly owned design language of the community. When they are done well  they are remixable  adaptable  and they are powerful. We could control the branding and graphical imagery of our cities with a good flag  but instead  by having bad flags we don't use  we cede that territory to sports teams and chambers of commerce and tourism boards. Sports teams can leave and break our hearts. And besides  some of us don't really care about sports. And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy. But a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people to the world at large. And when that flag is a beautiful thing  that connection is a beautiful thing. So maybe all the city flags can be as inspiring as Hong Kong or Portland or Trondheim  and we can do away with all the bad flags like San Francisco  Milwaukee  Cedar Rapids  and finally  when we're all done  we can do something about Pocatello  Idaho  considered by the North American Vexillological Association as the worst city flag in North America. Yeah. That thing has a trademark symbol on it  people.  Laughter  That hurts me just to look at. Thank you so much for listening.   Music by  Melodium   melodiumbox  and Keegan DeWitt   keegandewitt    Dannielle Hadley  Life in Pennsylvania means just that  life without the possibility of parole. For us lifers  as we call ourselves  our only chance for release is through commutation  which has only been granted to two women since       close to    years ago. Our song   This Is Not Our Home   it tells of our experiences while doing life without the possibility of parole. Brenda Watkins  I'm a woman. I'm a grandmother. I'm a daughter. I have a son. I'm not an angel. I'm not the devil. I came to jail when I was so young. I spend my time here inside these prison walls. Lost friends to death  saw some go home. Watch years pass  people come and go  while I do life without parole. I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done. I'm doing time here. This is not my home. Dream of freedom  hope for mercy. Will I see my family or die alone  As the years go by  I hold back my tears  because if I cry I'd give in to fear. I must be strong  have to hold on. Gotta get through another year. I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done. I'm doing time here. This is not my home. Dream of freedom  hope for mercy. Will I see my family or die alone  I'm not saying that I'm not guilty  I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay. All I'm asking is for forgiveness. Gotta have hope I'll be free someday. Is there a place for me in the world out there  Will they ever know or care that I'm chained  Is there redemption for the sin of my younger days  Because I've changed. Lord knows I've changed. I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done. I'm doing time here. This is not my home. Dream of freedom  hope for mercy.

Will I see my family or die alone  Or die alone  Chris Anderson  So I guess what we're going to do is we're going to talk about your life  and using some pictures that you shared with me. And I think we should start right here with this one. Okay  now who is this  Martine Rothblatt  This is me with our oldest son Eli. He was about age five. This is taken in Nigeria right after having taken the Washington  D.C. bar exam. CA  Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine. MR  Right. That was myself as a male  the way I was brought up. Before I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine. CA  You were brought up Martin Rothblatt. MR  Correct. CA  And about a year after this picture  you married a beautiful woman. Was this love at first sight  What happened there  MR  It was love at the first sight. I saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles  and we later began living together  but the moment I saw her  I saw just an aura of energy around her. I asked her to dance. She said she saw an aura of energy around me. I was a single male parent. She was a single female parent. We showed each other our kids' pictures  and we've been happily married for a third of a century now. CA  And at the time  you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur  working with satellites. I think you had two successful companies  and then you started addressing this problem of how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio. Tell us about that. MR  Right. I always loved space technology  and satellites  to me  are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors first pushed out into the water. So it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation of the oceans of the sky  and as I developed different types of satellite communication systems  the main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites  the consequence of which was that the receiving antennas could be smaller and smaller  and after going through direct television broadcasting  I had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite  the receiving dish could be so small that it would just be a section of a parabolic dish  a flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile  and it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio  and that's Sirius XM today. CA  Wow. So who here has used Sirius  MR  Thank you for your monthly subscriptions. CA  So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time. It was a huge commercial success  but soon after this  in the early     s  there was this big transition in your life and you became Martine. MR  Correct. CA  So tell me  how did that happen  MR  It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children  and I discussed with each of them that I felt my soul was always female  and as a woman  but I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it  so I always kept it bottled up and just showed my male side. And each of them had a different take on this. Bina said   I love your soul  and whether the outside is Martin and Martine  it doesn't it matter to me  I love your soul.  My son said   If you become a woman  will you still be my father   And I said   Yes  I'll always be your father   and I'm still his father today. My youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five year old thing. She told people   I love my dad and she loves me.  So she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever. CA  And a couple years after this  you published this book   The Apartheid of Sex.  What was your thesis in this book  MR  My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world  and actually  seven billion unique ways to express one's gender. And while people may have the genitals of a male or a female  the genitals don't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity. That's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts  and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white. We know from anthropological science that race is fiction  even though racism is very  very real  and we now know from cultural studies that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction. The reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female. CA  You yourself don't always feel     percent female. MR  Correct. I would say in some ways I change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle. CA   Laughs  Okay  now  this is your gorgeous daughter  Jenesis. And I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened. MR  Yes  she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs in our house to her bedroom  and after several months of doctors  she was diagnosed to have a rare  almost invariably fatal disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension. CA  So how did you respond to that  MR  Well  we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could. We ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington  D.C. The head of pediatric cardiology told us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant  but not to hold out any hope  because there are very few lungs available  especially for children. He said that all people with this illness died  and if any of you have seen the film  Lorenzo's Oil   there's a scene when the protagonist kind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son  and that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis. CA  But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do. You started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow. MR  Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time  and Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital while the other watched the rest of the kids  and when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping  I went to the hospital library. I read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension. I had not taken any biology  even in college  so I had to go from a biology textbook to a college level textbook and then medical textbook and the journal articles  back and forth  and eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible that somebody could find a cure. So we started a nonprofit foundation. I wrote a description asking people to submit grants and we would pay for medical research. I became an expert on the condition    doctors said to me  Martine  we really appreciate all the funding you've provided us  but we are not going to be able to find a cure in time to save your daughter. However  there is a medicine that was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company that could halt the progression of the disease  but Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome. They made a decision not to develop any medicines for rare and orphan diseases  and maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications to develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension. CA  So how on earth did you get access to this drug  MR  I went to Glaxo Wellcome and after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face because they weren't going to out license the drug to a satellite communications expert  they weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all  and they thought I didn't have the expertise  finally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me and develop enough credibility. I wore down their resistance  and they had no hope this drug would even work  by the way  and they tried to tell me   You're just wasting your time. We're sorry about your daughter.  But finally  for        dollars and agreement to pay    percent of any revenues we might ever get  they agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug. CA  And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way  by basically charging what it would take to make the economics work. MR  Oh yes  Chris  but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up    after I wrote the check for         and I said   Okay  where's the medicine for Jenesis   they said   Oh  Martine  there's no medicine for Jenesis. This is just something we tried in rats.  And they gave me  like  a little plastic Ziploc bag of a small amount of powder. They said   Don't give it to any human   and they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent  and from that  we had to figure out a way to make this medicine. A hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities all swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine. If it was turned into a medicine  it could never be delivered because it had a half life of only    minutes. CA  And yet  a year or two later  you were there with a medicine that worked for Jenesis. MR  Chris  the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless piece of powder that had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis is not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today  but produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue. CA  So here you go. So you took this company public  right  And made an absolute fortune. And how much have you paid Glaxo  by the way  after that         MR  Yeah  well  every year we pay them    percent of  .  billion      million dollars  last year     million dollars. It's the best return on investment they ever received.  Laughter  CA  And the best news of all  I guess  is this. MR  Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady. She's alive  healthy today at   . You see me  Bina and Jenesis there. The most amazing thing about Jenesis is that while she could do anything with her life  and believe me  if you grew up your whole life with people in your face saying that you've got a fatal disease  I would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again. But instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics. She says she wants to do all she can to help other people with orphan diseases get medicines  and today  she's our project leader for all telepresence activities  where she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together to find cures for pulmonary hypertension. CA  But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate. There are still many people dying  and you are tackling that too. How  MR  Exactly  Chris. There's some       people a year in the United States alone  perhaps    times that number worldwide  who continue to die of this illness because the medicines slow down the progression but they don't halt it. The only cure for pulmonary hypertension  pulmonary fibrosis  cystic fibrosis  emphysema  COPD  what Leonard Nimoy just died of  is a lung transplant  but sadly  there are only enough available lungs for       people in the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant  whereas nearly a half million people a year die of end stage lung failure. CA  So how can you address that  MR  So I conceptualize the possibility that just like we keep cars and planes and buildings going forever with an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts  why can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs to keep people living indefinitely  and especially people with lung disease. So we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome  Craig Venter  and the company he founded with Peter Diamandis  the founder of the X Prize  to genetically modify the pig genome so that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body and thereby to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs. We do this through our company  United Therapeutics. CA  So you really believe that within  what  a decade  that this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured  through these guys  MR  Absolutely  Chris. I'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had with direct television broadcasting  Sirius XM. It's actually not rocket science. It's straightforward engineering away one gene after another. We're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes is a routine activity  and the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics are able to zero in on the pig genome  find exactly the genes that are problematic  and fix them. CA  But it's not just bodies that    though that is amazing. It's not just long lasting bodies that are of interest to you now. It's long lasting minds. And I think this graph for you says something quite profound. What does this mean  MR  What this graph means  and it comes from Ray Kurzweil  is that the rate of development in computer processing hardware  firmware and software  has been advancing along a curve such that by the     s  as we saw in earlier presentations today  there will be information technology that processes information and the world around us at the same rate as a human mind. CA  And so that being so  you're actually getting ready for this world by believing that we will soon be able to  what  actually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever  How do you describe that  MR  Well  Chris  what we're working on is creating a situation where people can create a mind file  and a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms  personality  recollection  feelings  beliefs  attitudes and values  everything that we've poured today into Google  into Amazon  into Facebook  and all of this information stored there will be able  in the next couple decades  once software is able to recapitulate consciousness  be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file. CA  Now you're not just messing around with this. You're serious. I mean  who is this  MR  This is a robot version of my beloved spouse  Bina. And we call her Bina   . She was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas. There's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine with one of her caregivers  and she roams the web and has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms  personalities. She's kind of like a two year old kid  but she says things that blow people away  best expressed by perhaps a New York Times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Amy Harmon who says her answers are often frustrating  but other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed. CA  And is your thinking here  part of your hope here  is that this version of Bina can in a sense live on forever  or some future upgrade to this version can live on forever  MR  Yes. Not just Bina  but everybody. You know  it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files on Facebook  Instagram  what have you. Social media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time  and as apps become available that will allow us to out Siri Siri  better and better  and develop consciousness operating systems  everybody in the world  billions of people  will be able to develop mind clones of themselves that will have their own life on the web. CA  So the thing is  Martine  that in any normal conversation  this would sound stark staring mad  but in the context of your life  what you've done  some of the things we've heard this week  the constructed realities that our minds give  I mean  you wouldn't bet against it. MR  Well  I think it's really nothing coming from me. If anything  I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities that are being undertaken by the greatest companies in China  Japan  India  the U.S.  Europe. There are tens of millions of people working on writing code that expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness  and you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads are going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness  and it's something we'll value. There are so many things to do in this life  and if we could have a simulacrum  a digital doppelg nger of ourselves that helps us process books  do shopping  be our best friends  I believe our mind clones  these digital versions of ourselves  will ultimately be our best friends  and for me personally and Bina personally  we love each other like crazy. Each day  we are always saying  like   Wow  I love you even more than    years ago. And so for us  the prospect of mind clones and regenerated bodies is that our love affair  Chris  can go on forever. And we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will. CA  I think Bina's here  right  MR  She is  yeah. CA  Would it be too much  I don't know  do we have a handheld mic  Bina  could we invite you to the stage  I just have to ask you one question. Besides  we need to see you. Thank you  thank you. Come and join Martine here. I mean  look  when you got married  if someone had told you that  in a few years time  the man you were marrying would become a woman  and a few years after that  you would become a robot    how has this gone  How has it been  Bina Rothblatt  It's been really an exciting journey  and I would have never thought that at the time  but we started making goals and setting those goals and accomplishing things  and before you knew it  we just keep going up and up and we're still not stopping  so it's great. CA  Martine told me something really beautiful  just actually on Skype before this  which was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years as a mind file  but not if it wasn't with you. BR  That's right  we want to do it together. We're cryonicists as well  and we want to wake up together. CA  So just so as you know  from my point of view  this isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard  it's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard. It's just a delight to have you both here at TED. Thank you so much. MR  Thank you. When I was growing up  I really  liked playing hide and seek a lot. One time  though  I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot  but I fell and broke my arm. I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso. It was taken off six weeks later  but even then  I couldn't extend my elbow  and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it      times per day  seven days per week. I barely did it  because I found it boring and painful  and as a result  it took me another six weeks to get better. Many years later  my mom developed frozen shoulder  which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder. The person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food. She went each week to physical therapy  but just like me  she barely followed the home treatment  and it took her over five months to feel better. Both my mom and I required physical therapy  a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury. At first  a physical therapist works with patients  but then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home. But patients find physical therapy boring  frustrating  confusing and lengthy before seeing results. Sadly  patient noncompliance can be as high as    percent. This means the majority of patients don't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better. All physical therapists agree that special exercises reduce the time needed for recovery  but patients lack the motivation to do them. So together with three friends  all of us software geeks  we asked ourselves  wouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery  We started building MIRA  A P.C. software platform that uses this Kinect device  a motion capture camera  to transform traditional exercises into video games. My physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy. Let's see how this looks. The first game asks me to fly a bee up and down to gather pollen to deposit in beehives  all while avoiding the other bugs. I control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion  just like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off. When designing a game  we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do. We then make that a video game to give patients simple  motivating objectives to follow. But the software is very customizable  and physical therapists can also create their own exercises. Using the software  my physical therapist recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction  which is one of the movements my mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder. I can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen  while on the right  I see myself doing the recommended movement. I feel more engaged and confident  as I'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me. This basically extends the application for physical therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best. This is an auction house game for preventing falls  designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance. As a patient  I need to do sit and stand movements  and when I stand up  I bid for the items I want to buy. In two days  my grandmother will be    years old  and there's a    percent chance for people over    to fall at least once per year  which could lead to a broken hip or even worse. Poor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls  so reversing these problems through targeted exercise will help keep older people like my grandmother safer and independent for longer. When my schedule ends  MIRA briefly shows me how I progressed throughout my session. I have just shown you three different games for kids  adults and seniors. These can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients  but we'll soon have options for children with autism  mental health or speech therapy. My physical therapist can go back to my profile and see the data gathered during my sessions. She can see how much I moved  how many points I scored  with what speed I moved my joints  and so on. My physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment. I'm so pleased this version is now in use in over    clinics across Europe and the U.S.  and we're working on the home version. We want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment and help patients play their way to recovery at home. If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy  then we would have been more successful following the treatment  and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So Cosmin  tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away  What is that made of  and how much does it cost  Cosmin Milhau  So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro   for the demo  but you just need a computer and a Kinect  which is     dollars. TR  Right  and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes to do  D games  right  CM  Exactly  but you don't need the Xbox  you only need a camera. TR  Right  so this is less than a        solution. CM  Definitely      dollars  you can definitely use it. TR  So right now  you're doing clinical trials in clinics. CM  Yes. TR  And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version and I can do my exercise remotely  and the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that. CM  Exactly. TR  Cool. Thanks so much. CM  Thank you. I'd like to have you look at this pencil. It's a thing. It's a legal thing. And so are books you might have or the cars you own. They're all legal things. The great apes that you'll see behind me  they too are legal things. Now  I can do that to a legal thing. I can do whatever I want to my book or my car. These great apes  you'll see. The photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison who wrote a book called  James   Other Apes.  And he tells in his book how every single one them  almost every one of them  is an orphan who saw his mother and father die before his eyes. They're legal things. So for centuries  there's been a great legal wall that separates legal things from legal persons. On one hand  legal things are invisible to judges. They don't count in law. They don't have any legal rights. They don't have the capacity for legal rights. They are the slaves. On the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons. Legal persons are very visible to judges. They count in law. They may have many rights. They have the capacity for an infinite number of rights. And they're the masters. Right now  all nonhuman animals are legal things. All human beings are legal persons. But being human and being a legal person has never been  and is not today  synonymous with a legal person. Humans and legal persons are not synonymous. On the one side  there have been many human beings over the centuries who have been legal things. Slaves were legal things. Women  children  were sometimes legal things. Indeed  a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries has been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed these human things through the wall and have them become legal persons. But alas  that hole has closed up. Now  on the other side are legal persons  but they've never only been limited to human beings. There are  for example  there are many legal persons who are not even alive. In the United States  we're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons. In pre independence India  a court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person  that a mosque was a legal person. In       the Indian Supreme Court held that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person  and in       just recently  there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and the crown  in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed. Now  I read Peter Singer's book in       when I had a full head of lush  brown hair  and indeed I was moved by it  because I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless  defend the defenseless  and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions  billions of nonhuman animals are. And I began to work as an animal protection lawyer. And by       I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible  the reason being that all of my clients  all the animals whose interests I was trying to defend  were legal things  they were invisible. It was not going to work  so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had  at least some of them  had to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall and begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole onto the other side of being legal persons. Now  at that time  there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights  about the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal  and I knew it was going to take a long time. And so  in       I figured that it would take about    years before we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation  long term campaign  in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall. It turned out that I was pessimistic  that it only took   . So what we had to do in order to begin was not only to write law review articles and teach classes  write books  but we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts of how you litigate that kind of case. So one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was  a legal cause of action. And a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use to put their arguments in front of courts. It turns out there's a very interesting case that had occurred almost     years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart  whereby a black slave had used the legal system and had moved from a legal thing to a legal person. I was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it. James Somerset was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa. He survived the Middle Passage  and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia. Now     years later  Stewart brought James Somerset to London  and after he got there  James decided he was going to escape. And so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized  because he wanted to get a set of godparents  because to an   th century slave  they knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers was to help you escape. And so in the fall of       James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart. We don't know exactly what happened  but then James dropped out of sight. An enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of London  find him  bring him not back to Charles Stewart  but to a ship  the Ann and Mary  that was floating in London Harbour  and he was chained to the deck  and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets and be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica. Well now James' godparents swung into action. They approached the most powerful judge  Lord Mansfield  who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench  and they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus on behalf of James Somerset. Now  the common law is the kind of law that English speaking judges can make when they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions  and a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ  capital G  capital W  and it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will. A writ of habeus corpus is issued. The detainer is required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty. Well  Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat  because if James Somerset was a legal thing  he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus  only if he could be a legal person. So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume  without deciding  that James Somerset was indeed a legal person  and he issued the writ of habeus corpus  and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship. There were a series of hearings over the next six months. On June           Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious  and he used the word  odious   that the common law would not support it  and he ordered James free. At that moment  James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation. The free man who walked out of the courtroom looked exactly like the slave who had walked in  but as far as the law was concerned  they had nothing whatsoever in common. The next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project  which I founded  then began to look at what kind of values and principles do we want to put before the judges  What values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk  were they taught in law school  do they use every day  do they believe with all their hearts    and we chose liberty and equality. Now  liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because of how you're put together  and a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest. And the supreme interest in the common law are the rights to autonomy and self determination. So they are so powerful that in a common law country  if you go to a hospital and you refuse life saving medical treatment  a judge will not order it forced upon you  because they will respect your self determination and your autonomy. Now  an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled because you resemble someone else in a relevant way  and there's the rub  relevant way. So if you are that  then because they have the right  you're like them  you're entitled to the right. Now  courts and legislatures draw lines all the time. Some are included  some are excluded. But you have to  at the bare minimum you must    that line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end. The Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and self determining being like you're seeing behind me  that that's a violation of equality. We then searched through    jurisdictions  it took us seven years  to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. We chose the state of New York. Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be. We decided upon chimpanzees  not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors  but because they  Jane and others  have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades. We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have  and they also resemble the kind that human beings have. And so we chose chimpanzees  and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition. We found them in Japan  Sweden  Germany  Scotland  England and the United States  and amongst them  they wrote     pages of affidavits in which they set out more than    ways in which their complex cognitive capability  either individually or together  all added up to autonomy and self determination. Now  these included  for example  that they were conscious. But they're also conscious that they're conscious. They know they have a mind. They know that others have minds. They know they're individuals  and that they can live. They understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow. They engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday. They can anticipate tomorrow  which is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee  especially alone. It's the thing that we do to our worst criminals  and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it. They have some kind of moral capacity. When they play economic games with human beings  they'll spontaneously make fair offers  even when they're not required to do so. They are numerate. They understand numbers. They can do some simple math. They can engage in language    or to stay out of the language wars  they're involved in intentional and referential communication in which they pay attention to the attitudes of those with whom they are speaking. They have culture. They have a material culture  a social culture. They have a symbolic culture. Scientists in the Ta  Forests in the Ivory Coast found chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open the incredibly hard hulls of nuts. It takes a long time to learn how to do that  and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture  this way of doing it  these rocks  had passed down for at least       years through     chimpanzee generations. So now we needed to find our chimpanzee. Our chimpanzee  first we found two of them in the state of New York. Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed. Then we found Tommy. Tommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me. Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage. We found him in a small room that was filled with cages in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York. We found Kiko  who is partially deaf. Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts. And we found Hercules and Leo. They're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical  anatomical research at Stony Brook. We found them. And so on the last week of December       the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York using the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with James Somerset  and we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus. We wanted the chimpanzees out  and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps  a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida which involves an artificial lake with    or    islands    there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them. And these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee  with other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible. Now  all these cases are still going on. We have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield. We shall. We shall. This is a long term strategic litigation campaign. We shall. And to quote Winston Churchill  the way we view our cases is that they're not the end  they're not even the beginning of the end  but they are perhaps the end of the beginning. Thank you. Why do we cheat  And why do happy people cheat  And when we say  infidelity   what exactly do we mean  Is it a hookup  a love story  paid sex  a chat room  a massage with a happy ending  Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy  but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy  And is an affair always the end of a relationship  For the past    years  I have traveled the globe and worked extensively with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple of their relationship  their happiness and their very identity  an affair. And yet  this extremely common act is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone who has ever loved. Adultery has existed since marriage was invented  and so  too  the taboo against it. In fact  infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy  so much so  that this is the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible  once for doing it  and once just for thinking about it. So how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden  yet universally practiced  Now  throughout history  men practically had a license to cheat with little consequence  and supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam  so the double standard is as old as adultery itself. But who knows what's really going on under the sheets there  right  Because when it comes to sex  the pressure for men is to boast and to exaggerate  but the pressure for women is to hide  minimize and deny  which isn't surprising when you consider that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. Now  monogamy used to be one person for life. Today  monogamy is one person at a time. I mean  many of you probably have said   I am monogamous in all my relationships.  We used to marry  and had sex for the first time. But now we marry  and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love. Men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are  and who gets the cows when I die. Now  everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I've been asked that question since I arrived at this conference. It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding  sexting  watching porn  staying secretly active on dating apps. So because there is no universally agreed upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity  estimates vary widely  from    percent to    percent. But on top of it  we are walking contradictions. So    percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair  but just about the same amount of us will say that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one. Now  I like this definition of an affair    it brings together the three key elements  a secretive relationship  which is the core structure of an affair  an emotional connection to one degree or another  and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here  because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving  can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said  it's our imagination that is responsible for love  not the other person. So it's never been easier to cheat  and it's never been more difficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise  infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement  infidelity threatens our emotional security. Ironically  we used to turn to adultery    that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage  adultery destroys it. Now  there are three ways that I think infidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs  to be my greatest lover  my best friend  the best parent  my trusted confidant  my emotional companion  my intellectual equal. And I am it  I'm chosen  I'm unique  I'm indispensable  I'm irreplaceable  I'm the one. And infidelity tells me I'm not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters the grand ambition of love. But if throughout history  infidelity has always been painful  today it is often traumatic  because it threatens our sense of self. So my patient Fernando  he's plagued. He goes on   I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were  who we were as a couple  who I was. Now  I question everything.  Infidelity    a violation of trust  a crisis of identity.  Can I ever trust you again   he asks.  Can I ever trust anyone again   And this is also what my patient Heather is telling me  when she's talking to me about her story with Nick. Married  two kids. Nick just left on a business trip  and Heather is playing on his iPad with the boys  when she sees a message appear on the screen   Can't wait to see you.  Strange  she thinks  we just saw each other. And then another message   Can't wait to hold you in my arms.  And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me that her father had affairs  but her mother  she found one little receipt in the pocket  and a little bit of lipstick on the collar. Heather  she goes digging  and she finds hundreds of messages  and photos exchanged and desires expressed. The vivid details of Nick's two year affair unfold in front of her in real time  And it made me think  Affairs in the digital age are death by a thousand cuts. But then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal  we are relying on our partner's fidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never been more inclined to stray  and not because we have new desires today  but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires  because this is the culture where I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce because we were unhappy  today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame  today  choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather  she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they will judge her for still loving Nick  and everywhere she turns  she gets the same advice  Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed  Nick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. So if we can divorce  why do we still have affairs  Now  the typical assumption is that if someone cheats  either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people can't all be pathological. The logic goes like this  If you have everything you need at home  then there is no need to go looking elsewhere  assuming that there is such a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion has a finite shelf life  What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide  If even happy people cheat  what is it about  The vast majority of people that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are deeply monogamous in their beliefs  and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have actually been faithful for decades  but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross  and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what  Affairs are an act of betrayal  and they are also an expression of longing and loss. At the heart of an affair  you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection  for novelty  for freedom  for autonomy  for sexual intensity  a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy. I'm thinking about another patient of mine  Priya  who is blissfully married  loves her husband  and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she's always done what was expected of her  good girl  good wife  good mother  taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya  she fell for the arborist who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos  he's quite the opposite of her. But at     Priya's affair is about the adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another  it isn't always our partner that we are turning away from  but the person that we have ourselves become. And it isn't so much that we're looking for another person  as much as we are looking for another self. Now  all over the world  there is one word that people who have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me stories of recent losses    of a parent who died  and a friend that went too soon  and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair  because they raise these questions. Is this it  Is there more  Am I going on for another    years like this  Will I ever feel that thing again  And it has led me to think that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel people to cross the line  and that some affairs are an attempt to beat back deadness  in an antidote to death. And contrary to what you may think  affairs are way less about sex  and a lot more about desire  desire for attention  desire to feel special  desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair  the fact that you can never have your lover  keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine  because the incompleteness  the ambiguity  keeps you wanting that which you can't have. Now some of you probably think that affairs don't happen in open relationships  but they do. First of all  the conversation about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners  we still seem to be lured by the power of the forbidden  that if we do that which we are not supposed to do  then we feel like we are really doing what we want to. And I've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness  the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs  they probably would never need to see me. So how do we heal from an affair  Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us into new possibilities. The fact is  the majority of couples who have experienced affairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive  and others will actually be able to turn a crisis into an opportunity. They'll be able to turn this into a generative experience. And I'm actually thinking even more so for the deceived partner  who will often say   You think I didn't want more  But I'm not the one who did it.  But now that the affair is exposed  they  too  get to claim more  and they no longer have to uphold the status quo that may not have been working for them that well  either. I've noticed that a lot of couples  in the immediate aftermath of an affair  because of this new disorder that may actually lead to a new order  will have depths of conversations with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. And  partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious  they don't know where it's coming from. Something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire  and make way for an entirely new kind of truth. So when an affair is exposed  what are some of the specific things that couples can do  We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator acknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair  for Nick  one thing is to end the affair  but the other is the essential  important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty for hurting their partner  but they don't feel guilty for the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick  he needs to hold vigil for the relationship. He needs to become  for a while  the protector of the boundaries. It's his responsibility to bring it up  because if he thinks about it  he can relieve Heather from the obsession  and from having to make sure that the affair isn't forgotten  and that in itself begins to restore trust. But for Heather  or deceived partners  it is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self worth  to surround oneself with love and with friends and activities that give back joy and meaning and identity. But even more important  is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details    Where were you  Where did you do it  How often  Is she better than me in bed     questions that only inflict more pain  and keep you awake at night. And instead  switch to what I call the investigative questions  the ones that mine the meaning and the motives    What did this affair mean for you  What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me  What was it like for you when you came home  What is it about us that you value  Are you pleased this is over  Every affair will redefine a relationship  and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay  and they're not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire  they don't yield just simple answers of black and white and good and bad  and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner  with contempt  with neglect  with indifference  with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner. In other words  the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. Now  you've listened to me  and I know what you're thinking  She has a French accent  she must be pro affair. So  you're wrong. I am not French. And I'm not pro affair. But because I think that good can come out of an affair  I have often been asked this very strange question  Would I ever recommend it  Now  I would no more recommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer  and yet we know that people who have been ill often talk about how their illness has yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I've been asked since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk about infidelity is  for or against  I said   Yes.  I look at affairs from a dual perspective  hurt and betrayal on one side  growth and self discovery on the other    what it did to you  and what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed  I will often tell them this  Today in the West  most of us are going to have two or three relationships or marriages  and some of us are going to do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create a second one together  Thank you. So if I told you that this was the face of pure joy  would you call me crazy  I wouldn't blame you  because every time I look at this Arctic selfie  I shiver just a little bit. I want to tell you a little bit about this photograph. I was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway  just inside the Arctic Circle  and the water was hovering right at freezing. The air  A brisk     with windchill  and I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands  feet and face  and rush to protect my vital organs. It was the coldest I've ever been. But even with swollen lips  sunken eyes  and cheeks flushed red  I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy. Now  when it comes to pain  psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote   Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness. It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment. It brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation.  If shivering is a form of meditation  then I would consider myself a monk. Now  before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water  I would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like. but I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen. I can't stop shaking. I am so cold. Chris Burkard  So  surf photographer  right  I don't even know if it's a real job title  to be honest. My parents definitely didn't think so when I told them at    I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career  blue skies  warm tropical beaches  and a tan that lasts all year long. I mean  to me  this was it. Life could not get any better. Sweating it out  shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations. But there was just this one problem. You see  the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations  the less gratifying it seemed to be. I set out seeking adventure  and what I was finding was only routine. It was things like wi fi  TV  fine dining  and a constant cellular connection that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed in and out of the water  and it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated. I began craving wild  open spaces  and so I set out to find the places others had written off as too cold  too remote  and too dangerous to surf  and that challenge intrigued me. I began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane  because if there's one thing I've realized  it's that any career  even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography  has the danger of becoming monotonous. So in my search to break up this monotony  I realized something  There's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm  and it's really just that thin band around the equator. So if I was going to find perfect waves  it was probably going to happen somewhere cold  where the seas are notoriously rough  and that's exactly where I began to look. And it was my first trip to Iceland that I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for. I was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape  but most importantly  I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world. At one point  we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline. They created this barrier between us and the surf  and we had to weave  through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup. and once we got there  we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves. It was an incredible experience  one I'll never forget  because amidst those harsh conditions  I felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places  somewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world I knew I would never find on a crowded beach. I was hooked. I was hooked.  Laughter  Cold water was constantly on my mind  and from that point on  my career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments  and it took me to places like Russia  Norway  Alaska  Iceland  Chile  the Faroe Islands  and a lot of places in between. And one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there  hours  days  weeks spent on Google Earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to. And once we got there  the vehicles were just as creative  snowmobiles  six wheel Soviet troop carriers  and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights. Helicopters really scare me  by the way. There was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot  where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site. They walked off with our food and bits of our tent  clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot  not ours. But to me  that trip was a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches. Now  it wasn't until I traveled to Norway     Laughter     that I really learned to appreciate the cold. So this is the place where some of the largest  the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline. We were in this tiny  remote fjord  just inside the Arctic Circle. It had a greater population of sheep than people  so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found. I was in the water  taking pictures of surfers  and it started to snow. And then the temperature began to drop. And I told myself  there's not a chance you're getting out of the water. You traveled all this way  and this is exactly what you've been waiting for  freezing cold conditions with perfect waves. And although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger  I knew I wasn't getting out. So I just did whatever I could. I shook it off  whatever. But that was the point that I felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me  and what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full on blizzard  and I started to lose perception of where I was. I didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore  and all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls and crashing waves. Now  I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes  and while I was out there floating  I started to get a little bit nervous. Actually  I was totally freaking out    and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water. And I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what  but they told me later I had a smile on my face the entire time. Now  it was this trip and probably that exact experience where I really began to feel like every photograph was precious  because all of a sudden in that moment  it was something I was forced to earn. And I realized  all this shivering had actually taught me something  In life  there are no shortcuts to joy. Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit  and that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography  it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines. See  I gave a piece of myself in these places  and what I walked away with was a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for. So I look back at this photograph. It's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there  but most of all  what I see is just joy. Thank you so much. I've learned some of my most important life lessons from drug dealers and gang members and prostitutes  and I've had some of my most profound theological conversations not in the hallowed halls of a seminary but on a street corner on a Friday night  at   a.m. That's a little unusual  since I am a Baptist minister  seminary trained  and pastored a church for over    years  but it's true. It came as a part of my participation in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a    percent reduction in violent crime over an eight year period in a major city. But I didn't start out wanting to be a part of somebody's crime reduction strategy. I was     had my first church. If you would have asked me what my ambition was  I would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor. I wanted a             member church. I wanted my own television ministry. I wanted my own clothing line. I wanted to be your long distance carrier. You know  the whole nine yards. After about a year of pastoring  my membership went up about    members. So megachurchdom was way down the road. But seriously  if you'd have said   What is your ambition   I would have said just to be a good pastor  to be able to be with people through all the passages of life  to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks  and in the African American tradition  to be able to represent the community that I serve. But there was something else that was happening in my city and in the entire metro area  and in most metro areas in the United States  and that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously. And there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that I thought were very trivial  like bumping into someone in a high school hallway  and then after school  shooting the person. Someone with the wrong color shirt on  on the wrong street corner at the wrong time. And something needed to be done about that. It got to the point where it started to change the character of the city. You could go to any housing project  for example  like the one that was down the street from my church  and you would walk in  and it would be like a ghost town  because the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play  even in the summertime  because of the violence. You would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night  and to the untrained ear  it sounded like fireworks  but it was gunfire. You'd hear it almost every night  when you were cooking dinner  telling your child a bedtime story  or just watching TV. And you can go to any emergency room at any hospital  and you would see lying on gurneys young black and Latino men shot and dying. And I was doing funerals  but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life and there's a lot to say. I was doing funerals of    year olds     year olds  and    year olds  and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that would make some meaningful impact. And so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside of the city and moving their congregations out so that they could create or recreate their cities of God  the social structures in the inner cities were sagging under the weight of all of this violence. And so I stayed  because somebody needed to do something  and so I had looked at what I had and moved on that. I started to preach decrying the violence in the community. And I started to look at the programming in my church  and I started to build programs that would catch the at risk youth  those who were on the fence to the violence. I even tried to be innovative in my preaching. You all have heard of rap music  right  Rap music  I even tried to rap sermon one time. It didn't work  but at least I tried it. I'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon. He waited until everybody was gone  and he said   Rev  rap sermon  huh   And I was like   Yeah  what do you think   And he said   Don't do that again  Rev.  But I preached and I built these programs  and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference. But the violence just careened out of control  and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed  somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store  or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus  or kids who were playing in the park  oblivious to the violence on the other side of the park  but it coming and visiting them. Things were out of control  and I didn't know what to do  and then something happened that changed everything for me. It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie  walking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion to the housing project down the street from my church. They met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester  and they were killed. But as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded  he was running in the direction of my church  and he died some          yards away. If he would have gotten to the church  it wouldn't have made a difference  because the lights were out  nobody was home. And I took that as a sign. When they caught some of the youth that had done this deed  to my surprise  they were around my age  but the gulf that was between us was vast. It was like we were in two completely different worlds. And so as I contemplated all of this and looked at what was happening  I suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me  and the paradox was this  in all of those sermons that I preached decrying the violence  I was also talking about building community  but I suddenly realized that there was a certain segment of the population that I was not including in my definition of community. And so the paradox was this  If I really wanted the community that I was preaching for  I needed to reach out and embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition. Which meant not about building programs to catch those who were on the fences of violence  but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence  the gang bangers  the drug dealers. As soon as I came to that realization  a quick question came to my mind. Why me  I mean  isn't this a law enforcement issue  This is why we have the police  right  As soon as the question   Why me   came  the answer came just as quickly  Why me  Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it. Because I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this  and I'm starting to realize that that someone is me. I mean  isn't that how movements start anyway  They don't start with a grand convention and people coming together and then walking in lockstep with a statement. But it starts with just a few  or maybe just one. It started with me that way  and so I decided to figure out the culture of violence in which these young people who were committing them existed  and I started to volunteer at the high school. After about two weeks of volunteering at the high school  I realized that the youth that I was trying to reach  they weren't going to high school. I started to walk in the community  and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out during the day. So I started to walk the streets at night  late at night  going into the parks where they were  building the relationship that was necessary. A tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together  and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary and meet the youth where they were  and not try to figure out how to bring them in. And so we decided to walk together  and we would get together in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city on a Friday night and on a Saturday night at    p.m.  and we would walk until   or   in the morning. I imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking. I mean  we weren't drug dealers. We weren't drug customers. We weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on. It was probably a really odd thing. But they started speaking to us after a while  and what we found out is that while we were walking  they were watching us  and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things  that number one  we were going to be consistent in our behavior  that we would keep coming out there  and then secondly  they had wanted to make sure that we weren't out there to exploit them. Because there was always somebody who would say   We're going to take back the streets   but they would always seem to have a television camera with them  or a reporter  and they would enhance their own reputation to the detriment of those on the streets. So when they saw that we had none of that  they decided to talk to us. And then we did an amazing thing for preachers. We decided to listen and not preach. Come on  give it up for me. All right  come on  you're cutting into my time now  okay   Laughter  But it was amazing. We said to them   We don't know our own communities after   p.m. at night  between   p.m. and   a.m.  but you do. You are the subject matter experts  if you will  of that period of time. So talk to us. Teach us. Help us to see what we're not seeing. Help us to understand what we're not understanding.  And they were all too happy to do that  and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about  very different than what you see on the    o'clock news  very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media. And as we were talking with them  a number of myths were dispelled about them with us. And one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless and uncharacteristically bold in their violence. What we found out was the exact opposite. Most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on the streets. And we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and magnificent and wise people that we've ever met were on the street  engaged in a struggle. And I know some of them call it survival  but I call them overcomers  because when you're in the conditions that they're in  to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming. And as a result of that  we said to them   How do you see this church  how do you see this institution helping this situation   And we developed a plan in conversation with these youths. We stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved  and we started looking at them as partners  as assets  as co laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community. Imagine developing a plan  you have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table  coming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community. The Boston Miracle was about bringing people together. We had other partners. We had law enforcement partners. We had police officers. It wasn't the entire force  because there were still some who still had that lock 'em up mentality  but there were other cops who saw the honor in partnering with the community  who saw the responsibility from themselves to be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders in order to reduce violence in the community. Same with probation officers  same with judges  same with folks who were up that law enforcement chain  because they realized  like we did  that we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation  that there will not be enough prosecutions made  and you cannot fill these jails up enough in order to alleviate the problem. I helped to start an organization    years ago  a faith based organization  to deal with this issue. I left it about four years ago and started working in cities across the United States     in total  and what I found out was that in those cities  there was always this component of community leaders who put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone  who checked their egos at the door and saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts  and came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets  that the solution is not more cops  but the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community  to have a strong community component in the collaboration around violence reduction. Now  there is a movement in the United States of young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues that need to change if we're going to be a better society. But there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality and police misconduct against black on black violence. But it's a fiction. It's all connected. When you think about decades of failed housing policies and poor educational structures  when you think about persistent unemployment and underemployment in a community  when you think about poor healthcare  and then you throw drugs into the mix and duffel bags full of guns  little wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge. And then the response that comes from the state is more cops and more suppression of hot spots. It's all connected  and one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do is to be able to show the value of partnering together    community  law enforcement  private sector  the city    in order to reduce violence. You have to value that community component. I believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities. I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now. But I need your help. It can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out in the community. They need support. They need help. Go back to your city. Find those people.  You need some help  I'll help you out.  Find those people. They're there. Bring them together with law enforcement  the private sector  and the city  with the one aim of reducing violence  but make sure that that community component is strong. Because the old adage that comes from Burundi is right  that you do for me  without me  you do to me. God bless you. Thank you. Someone who looks like me walks past you in the street. Do you think they're a mother  a refugee or a victim of oppression  Or do you think they're a cardiologist  a barrister or maybe your local politician  Do you look me up and down  wondering how hot I must get or if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit  What if I wore my scarf like this  I can walk down the street in the exact same outfit and what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated depends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth. But this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab because Lord knows  Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth they choose  or not  to wrap their head in. This is about looking beyond your bias. What if I walked past you and later on you'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer  and that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team  because it's true. What if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years  because that's true  too. Would it surprise you  Why  Ladies and gentlemen  ultimately  that surprise and the behaviors associated with it are the product of something  called unconscious bias  or implicit prejudice. And that results in the ridiculously detrimental lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in areas of influence. Hello  Australian Federal Cabinet. Let me just set something out from the outset  Unconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination. I'm not saying that in all of you   there's a secret sexist or racist or ageist lurking within   waiting to get out. That's not what I'm saying. We all have our biases. They're the filters through which we see the world around us. I'm not accusing anyone  bias is not an accusation. Rather  it's something that  has to be identified  acknowledged and mitigated against. Bias can be about race  it can be about gender. It can also be about class  education  disability. The fact is  we all have biases against what's different  what's different to our social norms. The thing is  if we want  to live in a world where the circumstances of your birth do not dictate your future and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous  then each and every one of us has a role to play in making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives. There's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias and that's in the space of gender in the     s and     s. So orchestras  back in the day  were made up mostly of dudes  up to only five percent were female. And apparently  that was because men played it differently  presumably better  presumably. But in       The Boston Symphony Orchestra started an experiment. They started blind auditions. So rather than face to face auditions  you would have to play behind a screen. Now funnily enough  no immediate change was registered until they asked the audition ers to take their shoes off before they entered the room. because the clickity clack  of the heels against the hardwood floors was enough to give the ladies away. Now get this  there results of the audition showed that there was a    percent increased chance a woman would progress past the preliminary stage. And it almost tripled  their chances of getting in. What does that tell us  Well  unfortunately for the guys  men actually didn't play differently  but there was the perception that they did. And it was that bias that was determining their outcome. So what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging that a bias exists. And look  we all do it. Let me give you an example. A son and his father are in  a horrible car accident. The father dies on impact and the son  who's severely injured  is rushed to hospital. The surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like   I can't operate.  Why   The boy is my son.  How can that be  Ladies and gentlemen  the surgeon is his mother. Now hands up    and it's okay    but hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy  There's evidence that that unconscious bias exists  but we all just have to acknowledge that it's there and then look at ways  that we can move past it so that we can look at solutions. Now one of the interesting things around the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas. And this something  that's often brought up. And of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit. Look  I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick  I want to be picked because  I have merit  because I'm the best person for the job. It's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers that I work with and that I know. And yeah  I get it  I've been there. But  if the merit idea was true  why would identical resumes   in an experiment done in      by Yale  identical resumes sent out for a lab technician  why would Jennifers be deemed less competent  be less likely to be offered the job  and be paid less than Johns. The unconscious bias is there  but we just have to look at how we can move past it. And  you know  it's interesting  there's some research that talks about why this is the case and it's called the merit paradox. And in organizations    and this is kind of ironic    in organizations that talk about merit being their primary value driver in terms of who they hire  they were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more because apparently merit  is a masculine quality. But  hey. So you guys think you've got  a good read on me  you kinda think you know what's up. Can you imagine me running one of these  Can you imagine me walking in and being like   Hey boys  this is what's up. This is how it's done.  Well  I'm glad you can. Because ladies and gentlemen  that's my day job. And the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining. Actually  in places like Malaysia  Muslim women on rigs  isn't even comment worthy. There are that many of them. But  it is entertaining. I remember  I was telling one of the guys   Hey  mate  look  I really want  to learn how to surf.  And he's like   Yassmin  I don't know how you can surf with all that gear you've got on  and I don't know any women only beaches.  And then  the guy came up  with a brilliant idea  he was like   I know  you run that organization Youth Without Borders  right  Why don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches. You can call it  Youth Without Boardshorts.  And I was like   Thanks  guys.  And I remember another bloke  telling me that I should eat all the yogurt I could because that was the only culture  I was going to get around there. But  the problem is  it's kind of true because there's an intense  lack of diversity in our workforce  particularly in places of influence. Now  in       The Australian National University did an experiment where they sent out       identical applications to entry level jobs  essentially. To get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo Saxon name  if you were Chinese  you had  to send out    percent more applications. If you were Middle Eastern    Abdel Magied    you had to send out    percent  and if you're Italian   you're pretty lucky  you only have to send out    percent more. In places like Silicon Valley  it's not that much better. In Google  they put out  some diversity results and    percent white     percent Asian and nine  a bunch of blacks  Hispanics  all that kind of thing. And the rest of the tech world is not that much better and they've acknowledged it  but I'm not really sure what they're doing about it. The thing is  it doesn't trickle up. In a study done by Green Park  who are a British senior exec supplier  they said that over half of the FTSE     companies don't have a nonwhite leader at their board level  executive or non executive. And two out of every three don't have an executive who's from a minority. And most of the minorities  that are at that sort of level are non executive board directors. So their influence isn't that great. I've told you a bunch of terrible things. You're like   Oh my god  how bad is that  What can I do about it   Well  fortunately  we've identified that there's a problem. There's a lack of opportunity  and that's due to unconscious bias. But you might be sitting  there thinking   I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me   Let me offer you a solution. And as I've said before  we live in a world where we're looking for an ideal. And if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth don't matter  we all have to be part of the solution. And interestingly  the author of the lab resume experiment offered some sort of a solution. She said the one thing that brought the successful women together  the one thing that they had in common  was the fact that they had good mentors. So mentoring  we've all kind of heard that before  it's in the vernacular. Here's another challenge for you. I challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different. Think about it. Everyone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar  who looks like us  we have shared experiences. If I see a Muslim chick  who's got a bit of attitude  I'm like   What's up  We can hang out.  You walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school  you play the same sports  there's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out. But for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you it becomes extremely difficult  to find that connection. The idea of finding someone  different to mentor  someone who doesn't come from the same background as you  whatever that background is  is about opening doors  for people who couldn't even get to the damn hallway. Because ladies and gentlemen  the world is not just. People are not born  with equal opportunity. I was born in one of the poorest cities in the world  Khartoum. I was born brown  I was born female  and I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us for reasons I can't control. However  I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege. I was born with amazing parents  I was given an education and had the blessing of migrating to Australia. But also  I've been blessed with amazing mentors who've opened doors for me  that I didn't even know were there. A mentor who said to me   Hey  your story's interesting. Let's write something about it so that I can share it with people.  A mentor who said   I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig  but come on anyway.  And here I am  talking to you. And I'm not the only one. There's all sorts of people in my communities that I see have been helped out by mentors. A young Muslim man in Sydney who ended up using his mentor's help to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown and now it's a huge thing. And he's able to change the lives of so many other young people. Or a lady here in Brisbane  an Afghan lady who's a refugee  who could barely speak English when she came to Australia  her mentors helped her become a doctor and she took our Young Queenslander  of the Year Award in     . She's an inspiration. This is so not smooth. This is me. But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes  and I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning. Would you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me in one of those other versions of who I am  Because I'm that same person. We have to look past our unconscious bias  find someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum because structural change takes time  and I don't have that level of patience. So if we're going to create a change  if we're going to create a world where we all have those kinds of opportunities  then choose to open doors for people. Because you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you  but we are all part of this system and we can all be part of that solution. And if you don't know where to find someone different  go to the places you wouldn't usually go. If you enroll in private high school tutoring  go to your local state school or maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center. Or perhaps you work at an office. Take out that new grad who looks totally out of place    'cause that was me    and open doors for them  not in a tokenistic way  because we're not victims  but show them the opportunities because opening up your world will make you realize that  you have access to doors that they didn't even know existed and you didn't even know they didn't have. Ladies and gentlemen  there is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity  especially due to unconscious bias. But each and every one one of you has the potential to change that. I know you've been given a lot of challenges today  but if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently  because diversity is magic. And I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions because I bet you  they're probably wrong. Thank you. I'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life. Not little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs  although that would be nice. But it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away. Every star in our sky is a sun. And if our sun has planets    Mercury  Venus  Earth  Mars  etc.  surely those other stars should have planets also  and they do. And in the last two decades  astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets. Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets. We know  statistically speaking  that every star has at least one planet. And in the search for planets  and in the future  planets that might be like Earth  we're able to help address some of the most amazing and mysterious questions that have faced humankind for centuries. Why are we here  Why does our universe exist  How did Earth form and evolve  How and why did life originate and populate our planet  The second question that we often think about is  Are we alone  Is there life out there  Who is out there  You know  this question has been around for thousands of years  since at least the time of the Greek philosophers. But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting to finding out the answer to this question. It's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us. Now when I think about the possibilities for life out there  I think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars. This is a photograph of a real galaxy  we think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy. It's a collection of bound stars. But our  sun  is one of hundreds of billions of stars and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies. Knowing that small planets are very common  you can just do the math. And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there  that surely  there must be life somewhere out there. Well  the biologists get furious with me for saying that  because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet. Well  if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside and zoom in to where our sun is  we see a real map of the stars. And the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets. This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Here  this animation is zooming in onto our solar system. And you'll see here the planets as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun. Now if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America  and looking out at the night sky  here's what we'd see on a spring night. And you can see the constellations overlaid and again  so many stars with planets. There's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets. This is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years. Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets. This star is called Kepler    f. It's a system of about five planets. And by the way  most of these exoplanets  we don't know too much about. We know their size  and their orbit and things like that. But there's a very special planet here called Kepler    f. This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star  so that the temperature may be just right for life. Here  the artist's conception is just zooming in and showing you what that planet might be like. So  many people have this romantic notion of astronomers going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope. But actually  we just work on our computers like everyone else  and we get our data by email or downloading from a database. So instead of coming here to tell you about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis and the complex computer models we make  I have a different way to try to explain to you some of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets. Here's a travel poster   Kepler    f  Where the grass is always redder on the other side.  That's because Kepler    f orbits a red star  and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there  if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis  it has different pigments and looks red.  Enjoy the gravity on HD      g  a Super Earth.  This planet is more massive than Earth and has a higher surface gravity.  Relax on Kepler   b  where your shadow always has company.  We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars  and there's likely many more out there. If we could visit one of those planets  you literally would see two sunsets and have two shadows. So actually  science fiction got some things right. Tatooine from Star Wars. And I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets to tell you about. This one is Kepler   b  it's a hot  hot planet. It orbits over    times closer to its star than our Earth does to our sun. And actually  it's so hot  we can't visit any of these planets  but if we could  we would melt long before we got there. We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes. Gliese     b. This planet  we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density. It's somewhat warm. We actually don't know really anything about this planet  but one possibility is that it's a water world  like a scaled up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons that might be    percent water by mass. And in this case  it would have a thick steam atmosphere overlaying an ocean  not of liquid water  but of an exotic form of water  a superfluid    not quite a gas  not quite a liquid. And under that wouldn't be rock  but a form of high pressure ice  like ice IX. So out of all these planets out there  and the variety is just simply astonishing  we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets  we call them. Not too big  not too small  not too hot  not too cold    but just right for life. But to do that  we'd have to be able to look at the planet's atmosphere  because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat    the greenhouse effect. We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases on other planets. Well  science fiction got some things wrong. The Star Trek Enterprise had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds to orbit other planets so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere to see if the planet was habitable or if there were lifeforms there. Well  we don't need to travel at warp speeds to see other planet atmospheres  although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers from figuring out how to do that. We actually can and do study planet atmospheres from here  from Earth orbit. This is a picture  a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope taken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing after the last human space flight to Hubble. They installed a new camera  actually  that we use for exoplanet atmospheres. And so far  we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres  about six of them in great detail. But those are not small planets like Earth. They're big  hot planets that are easy to see. We're not ready  we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets. But nevertheless  I wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres. I want you to imagine  for a moment  a rainbow. And if we could look at this rainbow closely  we would see that some dark lines are missing. And here's our sun  the white light of our sun split up  not by raindrops  but by a spectrograph. And you can see all these dark  vertical lines. Some are very narrow  some are wide  some are shaded at the edges. And this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens  literally  for over a century. So here  each different atom and molecule has a special set of lines  a fingerprint  if you will. And that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres. And I'll just never forget when I started working on exoplanet atmospheres    years ago  how many people told me   This will never happen. We'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering   And that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now  and this is really a field of its own. So when it comes to other planets  other Earths  in the future when we can observe them  what kind of gases would we be looking for  Well  you know  our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere to    percent by volume. That's a lot of oxygen. But without plants and photosynthetic life  there would be no oxygen  virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere. So oxygen is here because of life. And our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres  gases that don't belong  that we might be able to attribute to life. But which molecules should we search for  I actually told you how diverse exoplanets are. We expect that to continue in the future when we find other Earths. And that's one of the main things I'm working on now  I have a theory about this. It reminds me that nearly every day  I receive an email or emails from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity or cosmology or some such. So  please don't email me one of your crazy theories. Well  I had my own crazy theory. But  who does the MIT professor go to  Well  I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine and he said   Sure  come and talk to me.  So I brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory. And that theory was that life produces all small molecules  so many molecules. Like  everything I could think of  but not being a chemist. Think about it  carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide  molecular hydrogen  molecular nitrogen  methane  methyl chloride    so many gases. They also exist for other reasons  but just life even produces ozone. So we go to talk to him about this  and immediately  he shot down the theory. He found an example that didn't exist. So  we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field. But back to exoplanets  the point is that life produces so many different types of gases  literally thousands of gases. And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out on which types of exoplanets  which gases could be attributed to life. And so when it comes time when we find gases in exoplanet atmospheres that we won't know if they're being produced by intelligent aliens or by trees  or a swamp  or even just by simple  single celled microbial life. So working on the models and thinking about biochemistry  it's all well and good. But a really big challenge ahead of us is  how  How are we going to find these planets  There are actually many ways to find planets  several different ways. But the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway so that in the future  we can find hundreds of Earths. We have a real shot at finding signs of life. And actually  I just finished leading a two year project in this very special phase of a concept we call the starshade. And the starshade is a very specially shaped screen and the goal is to fly that starshade so it blocks out the light of a star so that the telescope can see the planets directly. Here  you can see myself and two team members holding up one small part of the starshade. It's shaped like a giant flower  and this is one of the prototype petals. The concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together  with the petals unfurling from the stowed position. The central truss would expand  with the petals snapping into place. Now  this has to be made very precisely  literally  the petals to microns and they have to deploy to millimeters. And this whole structure would have to fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope. It's about tens of meters in diameter. And the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision so that we'd be able to see the planets directly. And it has to be a very special shape  because of the physics of defraction. Now this is a real project that we worked on  literally  you would not believe how hard. Just so you believe it's not just in movie format  here's a real photograph of a second generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab. And in this case  I just wanted you to know that that central truss has heritage left over from large radio deployables in space. So after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there  and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there  what are we going to find  Well  in the best case  we will find an image of another exo Earth. Here is Earth as a pale blue dot. And this is actually a real photograph of Earth taken by the Voyager   spacecraft  four billion miles away. And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics. But what's so awesome to consider is that if there are intelligent aliens orbiting on a planet around a star near to us and they build complicated space telescopes of the kind that we're trying to build  all they'll see is this pale blue dot  a pinprick of light. And so sometimes  when I pause to think about my professional struggle and huge ambition  it's hard to think about that in contrast to the vastness of the universe. But nonetheless  I am devoting the rest of my life to finding another Earth. And I can guarantee that in the next generation of space telescopes  in the second generation  we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths. And the capability to split up the starlight so that we can look for gases and assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  estimate the surface temperature  and look for signs of life. But there's more. In this case of searching for other planets like Earth  we are making a new kind of map of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them  including  planets  that actually might be inhabitable by humans. And so I envision that our descendants  hundreds of years from now  will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds. And they will look back at all of us as the generation who first found the Earth like worlds. Thank you. June Cohen  And I give you  for a question  Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen. Fred Jansen  You mentioned halfway through that the technology to actually look at the spectrum of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet. When do you expect this will be there  and what's needed  Actually  what we expect is what we call our next generation Hubble telescope. And this is called the James Webb Space Telescope  and that will launch in       and that's what we're going to do  we're going to look at a special kind of planet called transient exoplanets  and that will be our first shot at studying small planets for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable. JC  I'm going to ask you one follow up question  too  Sara  as the generalist. So I am really struck by the notion in your career of the opposition you faced  that when you began thinking about exoplanets  there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community that they existed  and you proved them wrong. What did it take to take that on  SS  Well  the thing is that as scientists  we're supposed to be skeptical  because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying actually makes sense or not. But being a scientist  I think you've seen it from this session  it's like being an explorer. You have this immense curiosity  this stubbornness  this sort of resolute will that you will go forward no matter what other people say. JC  I love that. Thank you  Sara. Now  I've been making pictures for quite a long time  and normally speaking  a picture like this  for me  should be straightforward. I'm in southern Ethiopia. I'm with the Daasanach. There's a big family  there's a very beautiful tree  and I make these pictures with this very large  extremely cumbersome  very awkward technical plate film camera. Does anybody know  x  and   x  sheets of film  and you're setting it up  putting it on the tripod. I've got the family  spent the better part of a day talking with them. They sort of understand what I'm on about. They think I'm a bit crazy  but that's another story. And what's most important for me is the beauty and the aesthetic  and that's based on the light. So the light's setting on my left hand side  and there's a balance in the communication with the Daasanach  the family of     all ages. There's babies and there's grandparents  I'm getting them in the tree and waiting for the light to set  and it's going  going  and I've got one sheet of film left  and I think  I'm okay  I'm in control  I'm in control. I'm setting it up and I'm setting up  and the light's just about to go  and I want it to be golden  I want it to be beautiful. I want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people  in all the potential glory that they could be presented. And it's about to go  and it's about to go  and I put my sheet in the camera  it's all focused  and all of a sudden there's a massive  whack   and I'm looking around  and in the top corner of the tree  one of the girls slaps the girl next to her  and the girl next to her pulls her hair  and all hell breaks loose  and I'm standing there going   But the light  the light. Wait  I need the light. Stay still  Stay still   And they start screaming  and then one of the men turns around and starts screaming  shouting  and the whole tree collapses  not the tree  but the people in the tree. They're all running around screaming  and they run back off into the village in this sort of cloud of smoke  and I'm left there standing behind my tripod. I've got my sheet  and the light's gone  and I can't make the picture. Where have they all gone  I had no idea. It took me a week  it took me a week to make the picture which you see here today  and I'll tell you why.  Applause  It's very  very  very simple    I spent a week going around the village  and I went to every single one   Hello  can you meet at the tree  What's your story  Who are you   And it all turned out to be about a boyfriend  for crying out loud. I mean  I have teenage kids. I should know. It was about a boyfriend. The girl on the top  she'd kissed the wrong boy  and they'd started having a fight. And there was a very  very beautiful lesson for me in that  If I was going to photograph these people in the dignified  respectful way that I had intended  and put them on a pedestal  I had to understand them. It wasn't just about turning up. It wasn't just about shaking a hand. It wasn't about just saying   I'm Jimmy  I'm a photographer.  I had to get to know every single one of them  right down to whose boyfriend is who and who is allowed to kiss who. So in the end  a week later  and I was absolutely exhausted  I mean on my knees going   Please get back up in that tree. It's a picture I need to make.  They all came back. I put them all back up in the tree. I made sure the girls were in the right position  and the ones that slapped  one was over there. They did look at each other. If you look at it later  they're staring at each other very angrily  and I've got the tree and everything  and then at the last minute  I go   The goat  the goat  I need something for the eye to look at. I need a white goat in the middle.  So I swapped all the goats around. I put the goats in. But even then I got it wrong  because if you can see on the left hand side  another little boy storms off because I didn't choose his goat. So the moral being I have to learn to speak Goat as well as Daasanach. But anyway  the effort that goes into that picture and the story that I've just related to you  as you can imagine  there are hundreds of other bizarre  eccentric stories of hundreds of other people around the world. And this was about four years ago  and I set off on a journey  to be honest  a very indulgent journey. I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist  perhaps in some ways naive. But I truly believe that there are people on the planet that are beautiful. It's very  very simple. It's not rocket science. I wanted to put these people on a pedestal. I wanted to put them on a pedestal like they'd never been seen before. So  I chose about    different groups  tribes  indigenous cultures. They were chosen purely because of their aesthetic  and I'll talk more about that later. I'm not an anthropologist  I have no technical study with the subject  but I do have a very  very  very deep passion  and I believe that I had to choose the most beautiful people on the planet in the most beautiful environment that they lived in  and put the two together and present them to you. About a year ago  I published the first pictures  and something extraordinarily exciting happened. The whole world came running  and it was a bizarre experience  because everybody  from everywhere   Who are they  What are they  How many are they  Where did you find them  Are they real  You faked it. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.  Millions of questions for which  to be honest  I don't have the answers. I really didn't have the answers  and I could sort of understand  okay  they're beautiful  that was my intention  but the questions that I was being fired at  I could not answer them. Until  it was quite amusing  about a year ago somebody said   You've been invited to do a TED Talk.  And I said   Ted  Ted  Who's Ted  I haven't met Ted before.  He said   No  a TED Talk.  I said   But who's Ted  Do I have to talk to him or do we sit with each other on the stage   And   No  no  the TED group. You must know about it.  And I said   I've been in a teepee and in a yurt for the last five years. How do I know who Ted is  Introduce me to him.  Anyway  to cut a long story short  he said   We have to do a TED Talk.  Researched. Oh  exciting. That's great  And then eventually you're going to go to TEDGlobal. Even more exciting. But what you need to do  you need to teach the people lessons  lessons that you've learned on your travels around the world with these tribes. I thought  lessons  okay  well  what did I learn  Good question. Three. You need three lessons  and they need to be terribly profound. And I thought  three lessons  well  I'm going to think about it. So I thought long and hard  and I stood here two days ago  and I had my test run  and I had my cards and my clicker in my hands and my pictures were on the screen  and I had my three lessons  and I started presenting them  and I had this very odd out of body experience. I sort of looked at myself standing there  going   Oh  Jimmy  this is complete loads of codswallop. All these people sitting here  they've had more of these talks  they've heard more lessons in their life. Who are you to tell them what you've learned  Who are you to guide them and who are you to show them what is right  what is wrong  what these people have to say   And I had a little bit of a  it was very private  a little bit of a meltdown. I went back  and a little bit like the boy walking away from the tree with his goats  very disgruntled  going  that didn't work  It wasn't what I wanted to communicate. And I thought long and hard about it  and I thought  well  the only thing I can communicate is very  very basic. You have to turn it all the way around. There's only one person I know here  and that's me. I'm still getting to know myself  and it's a lifelong journey  and I probably won't have all the answers  but I did learn some extraordinary things on this journey. So what I'm going to do is share with you my lessons. It's a very  as I explained at the beginning  very indulgent  very personal  how and why I made these pictures  and I leave it to you as the audience to interpret what these lessons have meant to me  what they could perhaps mean to you. I traveled enormously as a child. I was very nomadic. It was actually very exciting. All around the world  and I had this feeling that I was pushed off at great speed to become somebody  become that individual  Jimmy. Go off into the planet  and so I ran  and I ran  and my wife sometimes kids me   Jimmy  you look a bit like Forrest Gump   but I'm   No  it's all about something  trust me.  So I kept running and I kept running  and I sort of got somewhere and I sort of stood there and looked around me and I thought  well  where do I belong  Where do I fit  What am I  Where am I from  I had no idea. So I hope there aren't too many psychologists in this audience. Perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where I belonged. So whilst going  and don't worry  I didn't when I arrived with these tribes  I didn't paint myself yellow and run around with these spears and loincloths. But what I did find were people that belonged themselves  and they inspired me  some extraordinary people  and I'd like to introduce you to some heroes of mine. They're the Huli. Now  the Huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people on the planet. They're proud. They live in the Papua New Guinean highlands. There's not many of them left  and they're called the Huli wigmen. And images like this  I mean  this is what it's all about for me. And you've spent weeks and months there talking with them  getting there  and I want to put them on a pedestal  and I said   You have something that many people have not seen. You sit in this stunning nature.  And it really does look like this  and they really do look like this. This is the real thing. And you know why they're proud  You know why they look like this  and why I broke my back literally to photograph them and present them to you  It's because they have these extraordinary rituals. And the Huli have this ritual  When they're teenagers  becoming a man  they have to shave their heads  and they spend the rest of their life shaving their heads every single day  and what they do with that hair  they make it into a creation  a creation that's a very personal creation. It's their creation. It's their Huli creation. So they're called the Huli wigmen. That's a wig on his head. It's all made out of his human hair. And then they decorate that wig with the feathers of the birds of paradise  and don't worry  there are many birds there. There's very few people living  so nothing to get too upset about  and they spend the rest of their life recreating these hats and getting further and further  and it's extraordinary  and there's another group  they're called the Kalam  and they live in the next valley  but they speak a completely different language  they look completely different  and they wear a hat  and it's built out of scarabs  these fantastic emerald green little scarabs  and sometimes there are       or       scarabs in this hat  and they spend the whole of their life collecting these scarabs to build these hats. So the Huli inspired me in that they belong. Perhaps I have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where I actually fit. An extremely important part of this project was about how I photograph these extraordinary people. And it's basically beauty. I think beauty matters. We spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty  beautiful places  beautiful things  and ultimately  beautiful people. It's very  very  very significant. I've spent all of my life analyzing what do I look like  Am I perceived as beautiful  Does it matter if I'm a beautiful person or not  or is it purely based on my aesthetic  And then when I went off  I came to a very narrow conclusion. Do I have to go around the world photographing  excuse me  women between the age of    and     Is that what beauty is going to be  Is everything before and after that utterly irrelevant  And it was only until I went on a journey  a journey that was so extreme  I still get shivers when I think about it. I went to a part of the world  and I don't know whether any of you have ever heard of Chukotka. Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka  Chukotka probably is  technically  as far as one can go and still be on the living planet. It's    hours' flight from Moscow. First you've got to get to Moscow  and then    hours' flight nonstop from Moscow. And that's if you get there. As you can see  some people sort of miss the runway. And then when you land there  in Chukotka are the Chukchis. Now  the Chukchis are the last indigenous Inuits of Siberia  and they're people I'd heard about  I'd hardly seen any images of  but I knew they were there  and I'd been in touch with this guide  and this guide said   There's this fantastic tribe. There's only about    of them. You'll be okay. We'll find them.  So off we went on this journey. When we arrived there  after a month of traveling across the ice  and we'd got to them  but then I was not allowed to photograph them. They said   You cannot photograph us. You have to wait. You have to wait until you get to know us. You have to wait until you understand us. You have to wait until you see how we interact with one another.  And only then  it was many  many weeks later  I saw a respect. They had zero judgment. They observed one another  from the youth  from the middle aged to the old. They need each other. The children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don't have any teeth  but at the same time  the children take the old aged people out to the toilet because they're infirm  so there's this fantastic community of respect. And they adore and admire one another  and they truly taught me what beauty was. Now I'm going to ask for a little bit of audience interaction. This is extremely important for the end of my talk. If you could look at somebody left to the right of you  and I want you to observe them  and I want you to give them a compliment. This is very important. Now  it may be their nose or their hair or even their aura  I don't mind  but please look at each other  give them a compliment. You have to be quick  because I'm running out of time. And you have to remember it. Okay  thank you  thank you  thank you  you've given each other compliments. Hold that compliment very  very tightly. Hold it for later. And the last thing  it was extraordinarily profound  and it happened only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba. Now  the Himba live in northern Namibia on the border of Angola  and I'd been there a few times before  and I'd gone back to present this book I'd made  to show them the pictures  to get into a discussion with them  to say   This is how I saw you. This is how I love you. This is how I respect you. What do you think  Am I right  Am I wrong   So I wanted this debate. It was very  very  very emotional  and one night we were sitting around the campfire  and I have to be honest  I think I'd had a little bit too much to drink  and I was sort of sitting under the stars going   This is great  you've seen my pictures  we love each other.   Laughter  And I'm a little bit slow  and I looked around me  and I said  I thought  maybe  the fence is missing. Wasn't there a fence here last time I came  You know  this big protective fence around the village  and they sort of looked at me and go   Yeah  chief die.  And I thought  okay  chief dying  right  you know  look up at the stars again  look at the campfire. Chief die. What on Earth does chief die have to do with the fence   Chief die. First we destroy  yeah  Then we reflect. Then we rebuild. Then we respect.  And I burst out in tears  because my father had only just died prior to this journey  and I didn't ever acknowledge him  I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact that I'm probably standing here today because of him. These people taught me that we are only who we are because of our parents and our grandparents and our forefathers going on and on and on before that  and I  no matter how romantic or how idealistic I am on this journey  I did not know that until two weeks ago. I did not know that until two weeks ago. So what's this all about  Well  there's an image I'd like to show you  quite a special image  and it wasn't essentially the image I wanted to choose. I was sitting there the other day  and I have to finish on a strong image. And somebody said   You have to show them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets.  I was like  yeah  but that's not my favorite picture. She went   No no no no no no no. It's an amazing picture. You're in his eyes.  I said   What do you mean I'm in his eyes  It's a picture of the Nenets.  She said   No  look  look closely  you're in his eyes.  And when you look closely at this picture  there is a reflection of me in his eyes  so I think perhaps he has my soul  and I'm in his soul  and whilst these pictures look at you  I ask you to look at them. You may not be reflected in his eyes  but there is something extraordinarily important about these people. I don't ultimately have the answers  as I've just shared with you  but you must do. There must be something there. So if you can briefly reflect on what I was discussing about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots  and I need you all to stand for me  please. Now you have no excuse. It's almost lunchtime  and this is not a standing ovation  so don't worry  I'm not fishing for compliments. But you were given a compliment a few minutes ago. Now I want you to stand tall. I want you to breathe in. This is what I say. I'm not going to get on my knees for two weeks. I'm not going to ask you to carry a goat  and I know you don't have any camels. Photography's extraordinarily powerful. It's this language which we now all understand. We truly do all understand it  and we have this global digital fireplace  don't we  but I want to share you with the world  because you are also a tribe. You are the TED tribe  yeah  But you have to remember that compliment. You have to stand tall  breathe in through your nose  and I'm going to photograph you. Okay  I need to do a panoramic shot  so it's going to take a minute  so you have to concentrate  okay  Breathe in  stand tall  no laughing. Shh  breathe through your nose. I'm going to photograph. Thank you. I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies  succeed the most  what factors actually matter the most for startup success. I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place. If you take a group of people  with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup  you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve  unbelievable things. But if the startup  organization is so great  why do so many fail  That's what I wanted to find out. I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success. And I wanted to try  to be systematic about it  avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I've seen over the years. I wanted to know this because I've been starting businesses since I was    years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school  to high school  when I made solar energy devices  to college  when I made loudspeakers. And when I graduated from college  I started software companies. And    years ago  I started Idealab  and in the last    years  we started more than     companies  many successes  and many big failures. We learned a lot from those failures. So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First  the idea. I used to think that  the idea was everything. I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the  aha   moment when you first come up with the idea. But then over time  I came to think that maybe the team  the execution  adaptability  that mattered even more than the idea. I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage  but he once said   Everybody has a plan  until they get punched in the face.   Laughter  And I think that's so true about business as well. So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer. The customer is the true reality. And that's why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing. Then I started looking at the business model. Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues  That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success. Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that's the most important thing  And then of course  the timing. Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it  Is it early  as in  you're in advance and you have to educate the world  Is it just right  Or is it too late  and there's already too many competitors  So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies. And I looked across all     Idealab companies  and     non Idealab companies to try and come up with  something scientific about it. So first  on these Idealab companies  the top five companies    Citysearch  CarsDirect  GoTo  NetZero  Tickets.com    those all became billion dollar successes. And the five companies on the bottom    Z.com  Insider Pages  MyLife  Desktop Factory  Peoplelink    we all had high hopes for  but didn't succeed. So I tried to rank across all  of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions. And then for non Idealab companies  I looked at wild successes  like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn. And some failures  Webvan  Kozmo  Pets.com Flooz and Friendster. The bottom companies had intense funding  they even had business models in some cases  but they didn't succeed. I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies  and the results really surprised me. The number one thing was timing. Timing accounted for    percent of the difference between success and failure. Team and execution came in second  and the idea  the differentiability of the idea  the uniqueness of the idea  that actually came in third. Now  this isn't absolutely definitive  it's not to say that  the idea isn't important  but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing. Sometimes it mattered more when  it was actually timed. The last two  business model and funding  made sense to me actually. I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating. And funding  I think as well  if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction  especially in today's age  it's very  very easy to get intense funding. So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these. So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about. Well  that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought   No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger.  Of course  people proved that wrong. But one of the reasons it succeeded  aside from a good business model  a good idea  great execution  is the timing. That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money  and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger. Same thing with Uber. Uber came out  incredible company  incredible business model  great execution  too. But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money  it was very  very important. Some of our early successes  Citysearch  came out when people needed web pages. GoTo.com  which we announced actually at TED in       was when companies were looking for cost effective ways to get traffic. We thought the idea was so great  but actually  the timing was probably maybe more important. And then some of our failures. We started a company called Z.com  it was an online entertainment company. We were so excited about it    we raised enough money  we had a great business model  we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company. But broadband penetration was too low in          . It was too hard to watch video content online  you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff  and the company eventually went out of business in     . Just two years later  when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed    percent in America  YouTube was perfectly timed. Great idea  but unbelievable timing. In fact  YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started. It wasn't even certain that  that would work out. But that was beautifully   beautifully timed. So what I would say  in summary  is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot. But timing might matter even more. And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether  consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them. And to be really  really honest about it  not be in denial about any results that you see  because if you have something you love  you want to push it forward  but you have to be very  very honest about that factor on timing. As I said earlier  I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place. I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio  and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn't have happened otherwise. Thank you very much  you've been a great audience. Mark Twain summed up what I take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism. He said   There's something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact.  Twain meant it as a joke  of course  but he's right  There's something fascinating about science. From a few bones  we infer the existence of dinosuars. From spectral lines  the composition of nebulae. From fruit flies  the mechanisms of heredity  and from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain  or in my case  from the behavior of very young children  we try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition. In particular  in my lab in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT  I have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly. Because  it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children  which  to put a gentler spin on Mark Twain  is precisely their ability to draw rich  abstract inferences rapidly and accurately from sparse  noisy data. I'm going to give you just two examples today. One is about a problem of generalization  and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning. And although I'm going to talk about work in my lab  this work is inspired by and indebted to a field. I'm grateful to mentors  colleagues  and collaborators around the world. Let me start with the problem of generalization. Generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science. We poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections. We see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial  and we bring drugs to a national market. But this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population. If our sample is cherry picked in some way    say  we poll only urban voters  or say  in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease  we include only men    the results may not generalize to the broader population. So scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  but what does that have to do with babies  Well  babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time. They see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float  or a few balls and learn that they bounce. And they develop expectations about ducks and balls that they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives. And the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls they have to make about almost everything  shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. So do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population  Let's find out. I'm going to show you two movies  one from each of two conditions of an experiment  and because you're going to see just two movies  you're going to see just two babies  and any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways. But these babies  of course  here stand in for groups of babies  and the differences you're going to see represent average group differences in babies' behavior across conditions. In each movie  you're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do  and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are. But to my mind the magical thing  and what I want you to pay attention to  is the contrast between these two conditions  because the only thing that differs between these two movies is the statistical evidence the babies are going to observe. We're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls  and my then graduate student  now colleague at Stanford  Hyowon Gweon  is going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box  and when she pulls those balls out  she's going to squeeze them  and the balls are going to squeak. And if you're a baby  that's like a TED Talk. It doesn't get better than that. But the important point is it's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls. You could do that with your eyes closed. It's plausibly a random sample from this population. And if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak  then maybe everything in the box squeaks. So maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well. Now  those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end  so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to. They could pound them or whack them. But let's see what the baby does. Did you see that   Ball squeaks  Cool. See this one  Wow. Laura Schulz  Told you.  Laughs  Hey Clara  this one's for you. You can go ahead and play. LS  I don't even have to talk  right  All right  it's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls  and it's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us  but we've known those things about babies for a very long time. The really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing  and we can ensure it's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there  but this time  all we change is the apparent population from which that evidence was drawn. This time  we're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls  and guess what  You  probably won't  randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow balls. That is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence. That evidence suggests that maybe Hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls. Maybe there's something special about the blue balls. Maybe only the blue balls squeak. Let's see what the baby does. See this toy   Ball squeaks  Oh  that was cool. See   Ball squeaks  Now this one's for you to play. You can go ahead and play. LS  So you just saw two    month old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed. Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the percentage of babies who squeezed the ball in each condition  and as you'll see  babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it's plausibly representative of the population than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked. And this leads to a fun prediction  Suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box. You  probably won't  pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box  but you could randomly sample just one blue ball. That's not an improbable sample. And if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks  maybe everything in the box squeaks. So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking  and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw  we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more  and that's exactly what we found. So    month old babies  in this respect  like scientists  care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not  and they use this to develop expectations about the world  what squeaks and what doesn't  what to explore and what to ignore. Let me show you another example now  this time about a problem of causal reasoning. And it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have  which is that we are part of the world. And this might not seem like a problem to you  but like most problems  it's only a problem when things go wrong. Take this baby  for instance. Things are going wrong for him. He would like to make this toy go  and he can't. I'll show you a few second clip. And there's two possibilities  broadly  Maybe he's doing something wrong  or maybe there's something wrong with the toy. So in this next experiment  we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other  and we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do. Here's the setup. Hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed. I am then going to try twice and fail both times  and then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed  and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board. But the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn't with the toy  it's with the person. Some people can make this toy go  and some can't. Now  when the baby gets the toy  he's going to have a choice. His mom is right there  so he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person  but there's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth  and he can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy. So let's see what the baby does. LS  One  two  three  go  Arthur  I'm going to try again. One  two  three  go  YG  Arthur  let me try again  okay  One  two  three  go   Music  Look at that. Remember these toys  See these toys  Yeah  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Okay  Laura  but of course  babies love their mommies. Of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can't make them work. So again  the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly. This time  babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order  but we're changing the distribution of evidence. This time  Hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once  and so am I. And this suggests it doesn't matter who tries this toy  the toy is broken. It doesn't work all the time. Again  the baby's going to have a choice. Her mom is right next to her  so she can change the person  and there's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth. Let's watch what she does. Let me try one more time. One  two  three  go  Hmm. LS  Let me try  Clara. One  two  three  go  Hmm  let me try again. One  two  three  go   Music  HG  I'm going to put this one over here  and I'm going to give this one to you. You can go ahead and play. LS  Let me show you the experimental results. On the vertical axis  you'll see the distribution of children's choices in each condition  and you'll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe. So in the second year of life  babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to decide between two fundamentally different strategies for acting in the world  asking for help and exploring. I've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points  because the really critical point is that children's ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the species specific cultural learning that we do. Children learn about new tools from just a few examples. They learn new causal relationships from just a few examples. They even learn new words  in this case in American Sign Language. I want to close with just two points. If you've been following my world  the field of brain and cognitive sciences  for the past few years  three big ideas will have come to your attention. The first is that this is the era of the brain. And indeed  there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience  localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex  turning mouse brains transparent  activating neurons with light. A second big idea is that this is the era of big data and machine learning  and machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding of everything from social networks to epidemiology. And maybe  as it tackles problems of scene understanding and natural language processing  to tell us something about human cognition. And the final big idea you'll have heard is that maybe it's a good idea we're going to know so much about brains and have so much access to big data  because left to our own devices  humans are fallible  we take shortcuts  we err  we make mistakes  we're biased  and in innumerable ways  we get the world wrong. I think these are all important stories  and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human  but I want you to note that today I told you a very different story. It's a story about minds and not brains  and in particular  it's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform  which involve rich  structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data  the evidence of just a few examples. And fundamentally  it's a story about how starting as very small children and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture  we get the world right. Folks  human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data. Human minds think of altogether new ideas. Human minds generate research and discovery  and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater  and human minds take care of other humans  our old  our young  our sick. We even heal them. In the years to come  we're going to see technological innovations beyond anything I can even envision  but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child in my lifetime or in yours. If we invest in these most powerful learners and their development  in babies and children and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers the ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms of technology  engineering and design  we will not just be dreaming of a better future  we will be planning for one. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Laura  thank you. I do actually have a question for you. First of all  the research is insane. I mean  who would design an experiment like that   Laughter  I've seen that a couple of times  and I still don't honestly believe that that can truly be happening  but other people have done similar experiments  it checks out. The babies really are that genius. LS  You know  they look really impressive in our experiments  but think about what they look like in real life  right  It starts out as a baby. Eighteen months later  it's talking to you  and babies' first words aren't just things like balls and ducks  they're things like  all gone   which refer to disappearance  or  uh oh   which refer to unintentional actions. It has to be that powerful. It has to be much more powerful than anything I showed you. They're figuring out the entire world. A four year old can talk to you about almost anything. CA  And if I understand you right  the other key point you're making is  we've been through these years where there's all this talk of how quirky and buggy our minds are  that behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that that we're not rational agents. You're really saying that the bigger story is how extraordinary  and there really is genius there that is underappreciated. LS  One of my favorite quotes in psychology comes from the social psychologist Solomon Asch  and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the veil of self evidence from things. There are orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day that get the world right. You know about objects and their properties. You know them when they're occluded. You know them in the dark. You can walk through rooms. You can figure out what other people are thinking. You can talk to them. You can navigate space. You know about numbers. You know causal relationships. You know about moral reasoning. You do this effortlessly  so we don't see it  but that is how we get the world right  and it's a remarkable and very difficult to understand accomplishment. CA  I suspect there are people in the audience who have this view of accelerating technological power who might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes will a computer do what a three year old child can do  but what's clear is that in any scenario  our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers. LS  I think so. You'll have some machine learning folks up here. I mean  you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology as a matter of practice  but it's not just a difference in quantity  it's a difference in kind. We have incredibly powerful computers  and they do do amazingly sophisticated things  often with very big amounts of data. Human minds do  I think  something quite different  and I think it's the structured  hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge. CA  Laura Schulz  wonderful food for thought. Thank you so much. LS  Thank you.  Applause  In the great     s movie   The Blues Brothers   there's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment in Chicago for the very first time. It's a cramped  tiny space and it's just three feet away from the train tracks. As John sits on Dan's bed  a train goes rushing by  rattling everything in the room. John asks   How often does that train go by   Dan replies   So often  you won't even notice it.  And then  something falls off the wall. We all know what he's talking about. As human beings  we get used to everyday things really fast. As a product designer  it's my job to see those everyday things  to feel them  and try to improve upon them. For example  see this piece of fruit  See this little sticker  That sticker wasn't there when I was a kid. But somewhere as the years passed  someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit. Why  So it could be easier for us to check out  at the grocery counter. Well that's great  we can get in and out of the store quickly. But now  there's a new problem. When we get home and we're hungry and we see this ripe  juicy piece of fruit on the counter  we just want to pick it up and eat it. Except now  we have to look for this little sticker. And dig at it with our nails  damaging the flesh. Then rolling up that sticker    you know what I mean. And then trying to flick it off your fingers. It's not fun  not at all. But something interesting happened. See the first time you did it  you probably felt those feelings. You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit. You felt upset. You just wanted to dive in. By the   th time  you started to become less upset and you just started peeling the label off. By the    th time  at least for me  I became numb to it. I simply picked up the piece of fruit  dug at it with my nails  tried to flick it off  and then wondered   Was there another sticker   So why is that  Why do we get used to everyday things  Well as human beings  we have limited brain power. And so our brains encode the  everyday things we do into habits so we can free up space  to learn new things. It's a process called habituation and it's one of the most basic ways  as humans  we learn. Now  habituation isn't always bad. Remember learning to drive  I sure do. Your hands clenched at    and   on the wheel  looking at every single object out there    the cars  the lights  the pedestrians. It's a nerve wracking experience. So much so  that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn't even listen to music. But then something interesting happened. As the weeks went by  driving became easier and easier. You habituated it. It started to become  fun and second nature. And then  you could talk  to your friends again and listen to music. So there's a good reason why our brains habituate things. If we didn't  we'd notice every little detail  all the time. It would be exhausting  and we'd have no time to learn about new things. But sometimes  habituation isn't good. If it stops us from noticing  the problems that are around us  well  that's bad. And if it stops us from noticing  and fixing those problems  well  then that's really bad. Comedians know all about this. Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details  those idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember. He tells us about the time  he visited his friends and he just wanted to take  a comfortable shower. He'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way  and it was     degrees too hot. And then he'd turn it the other way  and it was     degrees too cold. He just wanted a comfortable shower. Now  we've all been there  we just don't remember it. But Jerry did  and that's a comedian's job. But designers  innovators  and entrepreneurs  it's our job to not just notice those things  but to go one step further and try to fix them. See this  this person  this is Mary Anderson. In      in New York City  she was visiting. It was a cold  wet  snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar. As she was going to her destination  she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely. When he opened the window  though  he let all this cold  wet air inside  making all the passengers miserable. Now probably  most of those  passengers just thought   It's a fact of life  he's got to open the window to clean it. That's just how it is.  But Mary didn't. Mary thought   What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could  actually stay warm   So she picked up her sketchbook right then and there  and began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper. Now as a product designer  I try to learn from people like Mary to try to see the world  the way it really is  not the way we think it is. Why  Because it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees. But it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees. Now some people think you're born with this ability or you're not  as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly. That wasn't the case for me. I had to work at it. During my years at Apple  Steve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day  to see our products through  the eyes of the customer  the new customer  the one that has fears  and possible frustrations and hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product could work straightaway for them. He called it staying beginners  and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster  easier and seamless for the new customers. So I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod. See  back in the '  s  being a gadget freak like I am  I would rush out to the store for the very  very latest gadget. I'd take all the time to get to the store  I'd check out  I'd come back home  I'd start to unbox it. And then  there was  another little sticker  the one that said   Charge before use.  What  I can't believe it  I just spent all this time buying this product and now I have to charge before use. I have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy. It was crazy. But you know what  Almost every product back then did that. When it had batteries in it  you had to charge it before you used it. Well  Steve noticed that and he said   We're not going to let that  happen to our product.  So what did we do  Typically  when you have a product that has a hard drive in it  you run it for about     minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive's going  to be working years later for the customer after they  pull it out of the box. What did we do instead  We ran that product for over two hours. Why  Well  first off  we could make a higher quality product  be easy to test  and make sure it was great for the customer. But most importantly  the battery came fully charged right out of the box  ready to use. So that customer   with all that exhilaration  could just start using the product. It was great  and it worked. People liked it. Today  almost every product that you get that's battery powered comes out of the box fully charged  even if it doesn't have a hard drive. But back then  we noticed  that detail and we fixed it  and now everyone else does that as well. No more   Charge before use.  So why am I telling you this  Well  it's seeing the invisible problem  not just the obvious problem  that's important  not just for product design  but for everything we do. You see  there are invisible problems all around us  ones we can solve. But first we need to see them  to feel them. So  I'm hesitant to give you any tips about neuroscience or psychology. There's far too many experienced people in the TED community who would know much more about that than I ever will. But let me leave you with a few tips that I do  that we all can do  to fight habituation. My first tip is to look broader. You see  when you're tackling a problem  sometimes  there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem. And sometimes  a lot  of steps after it. If you can take a step back and look broader  maybe you can change some of those boxes before the problem. Maybe you can combine them. Maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better. Take thermostats  for instance. In the     s when they first came out  they were really simple to use. You could turn them up or turn them down. People understood them. But in the     s  the energy crisis struck  and customers started thinking about how to save energy. So what happened  Thermostat designers decided  to add a new step. Instead of just turning up and down  you now had to program it. So you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time. Now that seemed great. Every thermostat had started adding that feature. But it turned out that no one saved any energy. Now  why is that  Well  people couldn't predict the future. They just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season  year to year. So no one was saving energy  and what happened  Thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step. They made better U.I.s  they made better documentation. But still  years later  people were not saving any energy because they just couldn't predict the future. So what did we do  We put a machine learning algorithm in instead of the programming that would simply watch when you turned it up and down  when you liked a certain temperature when you got up  or when you went away. And you know what  It worked. People are saving energy  without any programming. So  it doesn't matter what you're doing. If you take a step back  and look at all the boxes  maybe there's a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make  that process much simpler. So that's my first tip  look broader. For my second tip  it's to look closer. One of my greatest teachers  was my grandfather. He taught me all about the world. He taught me how things were built and how they were repaired  the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project. I remember one story  he told me about screws  and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job. There are many different screws  wood screws  metal screws  anchors  concrete screws  the list went on and on. Our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals. So what did we do  I remembered that story  that my grandfather told me  and so we thought   How many different screws  can we put in the box  Was it going to be two  three  four  five  Because there's so many different wall types.  So we thought about it  we optimized it  and we came up with three different screws to put in the box. We thought that was going to solve the problem. But it turned out  it didn't. So we shipped the product  and people weren't having a great experience. So what did we do  We went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right. And we designed a special screw  a custom screw  much to the chagrin of our investors. They were like   Why are you spending so much time on a little screw  Get out there and sell more   And we said   We will sell more if we get this right.  And it turned out  we did. With that custom little screw  there was just one screw in the box  that was easy to mount and put on the wall. So if we focus on those tiny details  the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say   Are those important or is that the way we've always done it  Maybe there's a way to get rid of those.  So my last piece of advice is to think younger. Every day  I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids. They come up with questions like   Why can't cars fly around traffic   Or   Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead   Sometimes  those questions are smart. My son came to me the other day and I asked him   Go run out to the mailbox  and check it.  He looked at me  puzzled  and said   Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail    Laughter  I was like   That's a pretty  good question.  So  they can ask tons of questions and sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers. We say   Son  that's just the way the world works.  So the more we're exposed to something  the more we get used to it. But kids haven't been around  long enough to get used to those things. And so when they run into problems  they immediately try to solve them  and sometimes they find a better way  and that way really is better. So my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team  or people with young minds. Because if you have those young minds  they cause everyone in the room to think younger. Picasso once said    Every child is an artist. The problem is when he or she grows up  is how to remain an artist.  We all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time  before a lifetime of habits  got in the way. Our challenge is to get back there  to feel that frustration  to see those little details  to look broader  look closer  and to think younger so we can stay beginners. It's not easy. It requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world. But if we do  we could do some pretty amazing things. For me  hopefully  that's better product design. For you  that could mean something else  something powerful. Our challenge is to wake up  each day and say   How can I experience the world better   And if we do  maybe  just maybe  we can get rid of these dumb little stickers. Thank you very much. The FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots in the United States than any other organization. More than al Qaeda  more than al Shabaab  more than the Islamic State  more than all of them combined. This isn't likely how you think about the FBI. You probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger  or arresting corrupt politicians. After the      terrorist attacks  the FBI became less concerned with gangsters and  crooked elected officials. The new target became terrorists  and the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI. Every year  the Bureau spends  .  billion dollars on domestic counterterrorism activities. Compare than to just  .  billion dollars combined for organized crime  financial fraud  public corruption and all other types of traditional criminal activity. I've spent years pouring through the case files of terrorism prosecutions in  the United States  and I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI is much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists. In the    years since       you can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States. These include the Boston Marathon  bombings in       as well as failed attacks  such as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad tried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square. In those same    years  the Bureau  however  has bragged about how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots. In all  the FBI has arrested more than     people in aggressive  undercover  conterterrorism stings. These operations  which are usually led by an informant  provide the means and opportunity  and sometimes even the idea  for mentally ill and  economically desperate people to become what we now term terrorists. After       the FBI was given an edict  never again. Never another attack on American soil. FBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck. To do this  agents recruited a network of more than        informants nationwide  all looking for anyone who  might be dangerous. An informant can earn          dollars or more for every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI. That's right  the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men six figures to spy on communities in the United States  but mostly Muslim American communities. These informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul Latif and Walli Mujahidh. Both are mentally ill. Abdul Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide. Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder  he had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy. In       the FBI arrested these two men for conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle with weapons provided   of course  by the FBI. The FBI's informant was Robert Childs  a convicted rapist and child molester who was paid        dollars  for his work on the case. This isn't an outlier. In       an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges led four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx. The lead defendant was James Cromitie  a broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems. And the informant had offered  him         dollars if he participated in that plot. There are many more examples. Today  The Intercept published my new story about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac  a young man who was living  near Tampa  Florida. Osmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder. He too was broke  and he had no connections to  international terrorist groups. Nonetheless  an FBI informant gave him a job  handed him money  introduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist  and lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar. But here's what's interesting  The lead undercover agent    you can see him in this picture with his face blurred    would go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on. Behind closed doors  FBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical. A federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations. He sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order in an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this. Behind closed doors  the lead agent  the squad supervisor  described their would be terrorist as a  retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in.  They described his terrorist ambitions as wishy washy and a pipe dream scenario. But that didn't stop the FBI. They provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed. They gave him a car bomb  they gave him an AK     they helped him make a so called martyrdom video  and they even gave  him money for a taxi cab so that he could get to where they wanted him to go. As they were working the sting  the squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending. And he got a Hollywood ending. When Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought was a car bomb  he was arrested  convicted and  sentenced to    years in prison. Sami Osmakac isn't alone. He's one of more than      so called terrorists  for whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings. U.S. government officials call this the War on Terror. It's really just theater  a national security theater  with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac unwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production brought to you by the FBI. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  those are some pretty strong accusations  pretty strong charges. How can you back this up  Trevor Aaronson  My research began in      when I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program at U.C. Berkeley  and a research assistant and I put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time during  the first decade after     . And we used the court file to find out whether the defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups  whether an informant was used  and whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur by providing the means and opportunity. And we submitted that to the FBI and we asked them to respond to our database. If they believed there were any errors  we asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check and they never challenged any of our findings. Later  I used that data  in a magazine article and later in my book  and on appearances on places like CBS and NPR  they were offered that opportunity again to say   Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong.  And they've never come forward and said   These are the problems with those findings.  So the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch on its recent report on  these types of sting operations. And so far  the FBI has never  really responded to these charges that it's really not catching terrorists so much as it's catching mentally ill people that it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations. TR  So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website  that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald. Tell us about your article  and why there. TA  The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this because my article is  really leveraging the fact that a source had leaked to me transcripts of these private FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed based on the government's claim  that their release would irreparably damage  the U.S. government's law enforcement strategy. So a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists and publish their work when they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this. So my story in The Intercept   which was just published today  tells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting and goes into much greater detail. In this talk  I could only highlight the things that they said  such as calling him a  retarded fool.  But it was much more elaborate  they went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands  which he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent. When he went to trial  the central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons  when in truth  these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated someone who was essentially mentally ill and broke to get money to then  pay for weapons that they could then charge him in a conspiracy for. TR  One final question. Less than    days ago  the FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn  saying that they might be headed to Syria  and were those real  or examples of more of the same  TA  Well so far  we only know what's come out in the court file  but they seem to suggest it's another example of the same. These types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor. So initially it was al Qaeda plots  and now the Islamic State is the current flavor. What's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged only began the plot to go to Syria after the introduction of the FBI informant  and in fact  the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed. In kind of a comical turn  in that particular case  one of the defendant's mother had found out that he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport. So it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport  that he ever could have gone anywhere. So yes  there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State in the United States  and those are people that the United  States government should be looking at to see if they're interested in violence here. In this particular case  given the evidence that's so far come out  it suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to Syria when they were never close  to that in the first place. TR  Thanks a lot  that's amazing. TA  Thank you. It was November          my first day as a principal  but hardly my first day in the school district of Philadelphia. I graduated from Philadelphia public schools  and I went on to teach special education for    years in a low income  low performing school in North Philadelphia  where crime is rampant and deep poverty is among the highest in the nation. Shortly after I walked into my new school  a huge fight broke out among the girls. After things were quickly under control  I immediately called a meeting in the school's auditorium to introduce myself as the school's new principal. I walked in angry  a little nervous    but I was determined to set the tone for my new students. I started listing as forcefully as I could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school. When  all of a sudden  a girl way in the back of the auditorium  she stood up and she said   Miss  Miss   When our eyes locked  she said   Why do you keep calling this a school  This is not a school.  In one outburst  Ashley had expressed what I felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when I attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood  many  many  many years earlier. That school was definitely not a school. Fast forwarding a decade later to       I was entering my third low performing school as principal. I was to be Strawberry Mansion's fourth principal in four years. It was labeled  low performing and persistently dangerous  due to its low test scores and high number of weapons  drugs  assaults and arrests. Shortly as I approached the door of my new school and attempted to enter  and found the door locked with chains  I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears going   Miss  Miss  This is not a school.  The halls were dim and dark from poor lighting. There were tons of piles of broken old furniture and desks in the classrooms  and there were thousands of unused materials and resources. This was not a school. As the year progressed  I noticed that the classrooms were nearly empty. The students were just scared  scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen  scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food. They were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying. This was not a school. And then  there were the teachers  who were incredibly afraid for their own safety  so they had low expectations for the students and themselves  and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school's culture. This was the most troubling of all. You see  Ashley was right  and not just about her school. For far too many schools  for kids who live in poverty  their schools are really not schools at all. But this can change. Let me tell you how it's being done at Strawberry Mansion High School. Anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you I am known for my slogans. So today  I am going to use three that have been paramount in our quest for change. My first slogan is  if you're going to lead  lead. I always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal. I am the principal  and having that title required me to lead. I was not going to stay in my office  I was not going to delegate my work  and I was not going to be afraid to address anything that was not good for children  whether that made me liked or not. I am a leader  so I know I cannot do anything alone. So  I assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children  and together  we tackled the small things  like resetting every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker. We decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright  colorful  and positive messages. We took the chains off the front doors of the school. We got the lightbulbs replaced  and we cleaned every classroom to its core  recycling every  every textbook that was not needed  and discarded thousands of old materials and furniture. We used two dumpsters per day. And  of course  of course  we tackled the big stuff  like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff. We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times  remediation  honors courses  extracurricular activities  and counseling  all during the school day. All during the school day. We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day  and we monitored at every second of the day  and  our best invention ever  we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled  Non negotiables.  It was a behavior system    designed to promote positive behavior at all times. The results  Strawberry Mansion was removed from the Persistently Dangerous List our first year after being    after being on the Persistently Dangerous List for five consecutive years. Leaders make the impossible possible. That brings me to my second slogan  So what  Now what  When we looked at the data  and we met with the staff  there were many excuses for why Strawberry Mansion was low performing and persistently dangerous. They said that only    percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis      percent of them live in poverty  only one percent of the parents participate  many of the children come from incarceration and single parent homes     percent of the students have special needs  and the state data revealed that six percent of the students were proficient in algebra  and    were proficient in literature. After they got through telling us all the stories of how awful the conditions and the children were  I looked at them  and I said   So what. Now what  What are we gonna do about it   Eliminating excuses at every turn became my primary responsibility. We addressed every one of those excuses through a mandatory professional development  paving the way for intense focus on teaching and learning. After many observations  what we determined was that teachers knew what to teach but they did not know how to teach so many children with so many vast abilities. So  we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction  making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom. The results  After one year  state data revealed that our scores have grown by     percent in Algebra and     percent in literature. We have a very long way to go  a very long way to go  but we now approach every obstacle with a  So What. Now What   attitude. And that brings me to my third and final slogan. If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will. My students have problems  social  emotional and economic problems you could never imagine. Some of them are parents themselves  and some are completely alone. If someone asked me my real secret for how I truly keep Strawberry Mansion moving forward  I would have to say that I love my students and I believe in their possibilities unconditionally. When I look at them  I can only see what they can become  and that is because I am one of them. I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too. I know what it feels like to go to a school that's not a school. I know what it feels like to wonder if there's ever going to be any way out of poverty. But because of my amazing mother  I got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me. So    if I'm going to push my students toward their dream and their purpose in life  I've got to get to know who they are. So I have to spend time with them  so I manage the lunchroom every day. And while I'm there  I talk to them about deeply personal things  and when it's their birthday  I sing  Happy Birthday  even though I cannot sing at all. I often ask them   Why do you want me to sing when I cannot sing at all   And they respond by saying   Because we like feeling special.  We hold monthly town hall meetings to listen to their concerns  to find out what is on their minds. They ask us questions like   Why do we have to follow rules    Why are there so many consequences    Why can't we just do what we want to do   They ask  and I answer each question honestly  and this exchange in listening helps to clear up any misconceptions. Every moment is a teachable moment. My reward  my reward for being non negotiable in my rules and consequences is their earned respect. I insist on it  and because of this  we can accomplish things together. They are clear about my expectations for them  and I repeat those expectations every day over the P.A. system. I remind them    I remind them of those core values of focus  tradition  excellence  integrity and perseverance  and I remind them every day how education can truly change their lives. And I end every announcement the same   If nobody told you they loved you today  you remember I do  and I always will.  Ashley's words of  Miss  Miss  this is not a school   is forever etched in my mind. If we are truly going to make real progress in addressing poverty  then we have to make sure that every school that serves children in poverty is a real school  a school  a school    a school that provides them with knowledge and mental training to navigate the world around them. I do not know all the answers  but what I do know is for those of us who are privileged and have the responsibility of leading a school that serves children in poverty  we must truly lead  and when we are faced with unbelievable challenges  we must stop and ask ourselves   So what. Now what  What are we going to do about it   And as we lead  we must never forget that every single one of our students is just a child  often scared by what the world tells them they should be  and no matter what the rest of the world tells them they should be  we should always provide them with hope  our undivided attention  unwavering belief in their potential  consistent expectations  and we must tell them often  if nobody told them they loved them today  remember we do  and we always will. Thank you. Thank you  Jesus. In       during the final six months of Kim Jong Il's life  I lived undercover in North Korea. I was born and raised in South Korea  their enemy. I live in America  their other enemy. Since       I had visited North Korea a few times. And I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning  or to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda  the only option was total immersion. So I posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in Pyongyang. The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology was founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime to educate the sons of the North Korean elite  without proselytizing  which is a capital crime there. The students were     young men  expected to be the future leaders of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence. When I arrived  they became my students.      was a special year  marking the    th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader  Kim Il Sung. To celebrate the occasion  the regime shut down all universities  and sent students off to the fields to build the DPRK's much heralded ideal as the world's most powerful and prosperous nation. My students were the only ones spared from that fate. North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation. Everything there is about the Great Leader. Every book  every newspaper article  every song  every TV program    there is just one subject. The flowers are named after him  the mountains are carved with his slogans. Every citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times. Even their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il Sung. The school was a heavily guarded prison  posing as a campus. Teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder. Even then  our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments celebrating the Great Leader. The students were not allowed to leave the campus  or communicate with their parents. Their days were meticulously mapped out  and any free time they had was devoted to honoring their Great Leader. Lesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff  every class was recorded and reported on  every room was bugged  and every conversation  overheard. Every blank space was covered with the  portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il  like everywhere else in North Korea. We were never allowed to discuss the outside world. As students of science and technology  many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the Internet. They had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs. Facebook  Twitter    none of those things would have meant a thing. And I could not tell them. I went there looking for truth. But where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology  my students' day to day realities  and even my own position at the universities  were all built on lies  I started with a game. We played  Truth and Lie.  A volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard  and the other students had to guess whether it was a truth or a lie. Once a student wrote   I visited China last year on vacation   and everyone shouted   Lie   They all knew this wasn't possible. Virtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country. Even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass. I had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students  because they lie so often and so easily  whether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader  or the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders. The difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them. It took me a while to understand the different types of lies  they lie to shield their system from the world  or they were taught lies  and were just regurgitating them. Or  at moments  they lied out of habit. But if all they have ever known were lies  how could we expect them to be otherwise  Next  I tried to teach them essay writing. But that turned out to be nearly impossible. Essays are about coming up with one's own thesis  and making an evidence based argument to prove it. These students  however  were simply told what to think  and they obeyed. In their world  critical thinking was not allowed. I also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter  to anybody. It took a long time  but eventually some of them began to write to their mothers  their friends  their girlfriends. Although those were just homework  and would never reach their intended recipients  my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them. They wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything. They were worried about their future. In those letters  they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader. I was spending all of my time with these young men. We all ate meals together  played basketball together. I often called them gentlemen  which made them giggle. They blushed at the mention of girls. And I came to adore them. And watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways  was deeply moving. But something also felt wrong. During those months of living in their world  I often wondered if the truth would  in fact  improve their lives. I wanted so much to tell them the truth  of their country and of the outside world  where Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out  using the power of social media  where everyone except them was connected through the world wide web  which wasn't worldwide after all. But for them  the truth was dangerous. By encouraging them to run after it  I was putting them at risk    of persecution  of heartbreak. When you're not allowed to express anything in the open  you become good at reading what is unspoken. In one of their personal letters to me  a student wrote that he understood why I always called them gentlemen. It was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life  he said. On my last day in December of       the day Kim Jong Il's death was announced  their world shattered. I had to leave without a proper goodbye. But I think they knew how sad I was for them. Once  toward the end of my stay  a student said to me   Professor  we never think of you as being different from us. Our circumstances are different  but you're the same as us. We want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same.  Today  if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own  which is of course impossible  I would tell them this   My dear gentlemen  It's been a bit over three years since I last saw you. And now  you must be       maybe even as old as   . At our final class  I asked you if there was anything you wanted. The only wish you expressed  the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together  was for me to speak to you in Korean. Just once. I was there to teach you English  you knew it wasn't allowed. But I understood then  you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue. I called you my gentlemen  but I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong Un's merciless North Korea is a good thing. I don't want you to lead a revolution    let some other young person do it. The rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of North Korean Spring  but I don't want you to do anything risky  because I know in your world  someone is always watching. I don't want to imagine what might happen to you. If my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you  I would rather you forget me. Become soldiers of your Great Leader  and live long  safe lives. You once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful  and I could not answer truthfully then. But I know why you asked. I know that it was important for you to hear that I  your teacher  the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from  declare your city as the most beautiful. I know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable  but no  I don't find your capital beautiful. Not because it's monotone and concrete  but because of what it symbolizes  a monster that feeds off the rest of the country  where citizens are soldiers and slaves. All I see there is darkness. But it's your home  so I cannot hate it. And I hope instead that you  my lovely young gentlemen  will one day help make it beautiful. Thank you. This is a play called  Sell Buy Date.  It's my first since  Bridge and Tunnel   which I did on Broadway  and this one  I    thank you    I've excerpted it just for you  so here we go. Right. Class  let's be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off before we begin. So class  hopefully you'll recognize what you just heard me say as the      Very good  the cellular phone announcement. Right  This was also known as a mobile phone. So you'll remember  people of that era would have had an external electronic device  right  something like this  and they all would have carried one of these around with them  and amongst their biggest fears was the sheer mortification that one of these might ring at some inopportune moment. Right  So a bit of trivia about that era for you. So the format of today's class is I will be presenting multiple BERT modules today from that period in history  right  so starting circa     . And remember  this was the very first year of the BERT program. So we've got quite a few of these to get through. Bear in mind  I will be living into various different bodies  different ages  also what were then called races  or ethnic groups  as you'll remember from Unit  . And     Laughter     and along the gender continuum  I will be living into males as well. It was quite binary at that time. Also  don't forget  we are reading the book module for next week's focus on gender. Now  I know some of you have requested the book in pill form. I know people still believe ingesting it is better for retention  but since we are trying to experience what our forebears did  right  let's please just consider doing the actual ocular reading  okay  And also  how many people have your emotional shunts engaged  Right. Please toggle them off. Okay  I know it's challenging  but I want you to be able to feel the entire natural emo range  all right  It is essential to this part of the syllabus. Yes  Macy  All right. I understand. If you're unwilling to    All right  well  we can discuss that after class. All right  we will discuss your concerns. Just relax. Nobody's died and gone to composting. Okay. After class. Okay  After class. Let's just get started  okay. This first subject identified as a middle class homemaker. Remember  these early modules in these people's full identities were protected  and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic  which for many of them was taboo. Okay honey  now  I'm ready when you are. No  sweetheart  I said  I'm ready when you are. I'm freezing. It's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio. I should have brought a shmata. All this fancy technology but they can't afford heat. What is he saying  I can't hear you  I can't hear you through the glass  honey  There you are in my ear. Oh  you can hear me  The whole time. Oh  yes  I am a little chilly. Yes  oh the cold is for the machines  the new technology. Okay. Yes  now remind me again  you're recording not only my voice but my feelings and my memories  Right. Yes  BERT  yes  I read about it. Bio Empathetic Resonant Technology. Right  right  so people will be able to feel my experience and my memory  Okay. No  right  I'm ready. I just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memory's doing. I was going to tell you you're too late  it's already bad news. No  no  go ahead  honey. Oh  that's the first question  What do I think of prostitution  Are you soliciting me  young man  I've heard of May December romances  but what are you  about    years old  Eighteen  Eighteen years. I think I have candies in my purse older than    years old. I'm teasing you  sweetheart. No  I'm comfortable with any question. Sure. So about the prostitution    oh  sex worker  sex worker. No  just in my day  they called it prostitution  not sex work. Oh  because it includes pornography also  Okay. No  well  I guess when I was a girl  we didn't really have a name for that either. We would have said dirty magazines  I suppose  or dirty movies. Well  it's not like what you have with the Internet. No  well  I don't mind sharing. My late husband and I  we were a very romantic couple. Lots of tenderness  you understand. Well  as you get older  you know  at one point I thought my husband might be helped by using some of the pills men can take  but he wasn't interested in those  so I thought  what about maybe watching an adult movie on the Internet  Just for inspiration  you understand. Well  at the time  neither of us were very good on the computer  so usually  if we needed help with the Internet  we would just call our children or our grandchildren  but obviously  in this case  that wasn't an option  so I thought  I'll have a look myself  just to see. How difficult could it be  You search for certain key words and you look    Oh wow is right  young man. You can't imagine what I saw. Well  first of all  I was just trying to find  you know  couples  normal couples making love  but this  so many people together at one time. You couldn't tell which part belonged to which body. How they even got the cameras to capture some of this  I couldn't tell you. But the one thing they didn't capture was making love. There was lots of making of something  but they took the love part right out of it  you know  the fun. It was all very extreme  you know  Like you would say  with the extreme sports. Lots of endurance  but never tenderness. So anyway  needless to say  that was    .   I'll never get back again  but it only showed up on the credit card as  entertainment services   so my husband was never the wiser  and after all of that  well  you could say it turned out he didn't need the extra inspiration after all. Right  so next subject is a young woman     Applause     Next subject  class  is a young woman called Bella  a university student interviewed in      during what was called an Intro to Feminist Porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the Bay Area. Yeah  I just want to  like  get a recording of  like  you guys recording me  like a meta recording  or whatever. It's just like this whole experience is just  like  really amazing  and I'd like to capture that for  like  Instagram and my Tumblr. So  like  hi guys  it's me  Bella  and I am  like  being interviewed right now for this  like  really amazing Bio Empathetic Resonance Technology  which is  like  basically where they are  like  recording  as you can see from these  whatever  like  electrodes  the formation of  like  neuropeptides in my hippocampus  or whatever. They will later be able to reconstitute these as  like  my own actual memory  like actual experiences  so other people can  like  actually feel what I'm feeling right now. Okay. Okay. So  like  hello  BERT person of the future who is experiencing me. This is what it feels like to be  like  a college freshman  and also the  like  headache that you are experiencing through me is the  like  residual effect of the Jell O shots which I had last night at the bi weekly feminist pole dancing party which I cohost on Wednesdays. It's called  Don't Get All Pole emical      Laughter     and it's in Beekman Hall  and  what else  like  non Jell O shots are also available for vegans  and  oh  okay  yeah  totally  yeah  we should also focus on your questions also. So for your record  I am  like  a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a concentration on notable YouTube memes. Yes  well  of course  like  I consider myself to be  like  obviously  like  a feminist. I was named for Bella Abzug  who was  like  a famous  like  feminist from history  and  like  also I feel that it is  like  important to  like  represent women who are  like  sex positive feminists. What is sex negative  Well  like  I guess I would ask  like  what do you think sex negative is   Laughter  Yeah  because  like  the terms that we use are  like  so important  because  like  we call it sex work because it helps people understand that  like  it's work  and  like  you know  just like there are  like  healthcare providers and  like  insurance providers  like  we think of these workers as  like  sex care providers. Yeah  but like  I don't think of myself like  providing direct sex care services per se as  like  being a requirement for me to be  like  an advocate. Like  I support other women's right to choose it voluntarily  like  if they enjoy it. Yeah  but  like  I see myself going forward as more likely  like  protecting sex workers'  like  legal freedoms and rights. Yeah  so  like  basically  I'm planning on becoming a lawyer. Right  class.  Laughter   Applause  So these next two modules are also circa     . One subject is an Irishwoman with a particularly noteworthy relationship to this issue  but first will be a West Indian woman  a self described escort who was recorded at a sex workers' rights rally and parade. She was interviewed whilst marching in full carnival headdress and very little else. All right  you want me to start talking now. Yeah  I told you  you can put those wires anywhere you want to as long as it don't get in the way. Yeah  no  but  tell me again what the name of    BERT  BERT. Yeah  I was telling you  you know  I think I have in all my time I have had at least one client with that name  so this won't be the first time I had BERT all over me. Oh  I'm sorry  but you got to get into the spirit of it if you're going to interview me. All right  You can say it. No justice  no piece  No justice  no piece  But you see the sign  You get it  P I E C E. No justice  no piece of us. You understand  Right  so that's the part where I was telling you is that when I first came to this country  I worked every job I could find. I was a nanny  I was a home care attendant for all these different old people  and then I said  child  if I have to touch another white man's backside  I might as well get paid a lot more money for it than this  you understand  Pshh  you know how hard it is being a domestic worker  Some of these men  they're heavy. You have to pick them up and flip them over. Now  I let them pick me up and flip me over  you understand  Well  you have to have a sense of humor about it  that's what I think. No  but see  listen  you find me somebody who don't hate some part of their job. I mean  there's a lot of things about this job that I hate  but the money is not one of them  and I will tell you  as long as this is the best possibility for me to make real money  I am going to be Jamaican No Fakin' if that's what they want to call me. No  I'm not even from Jamaica. That's how they market me. My family is from Trinidad and the Virgin Islands. They don't know what I do  but you know what  My children  they know that their school fees are paid  they have their books and their computer  and this way  I know that they have a chance. So I'm not going to tell you that what I do  it's easy  I'm not going to tell you that I feel    what's that you said  liberated  But I'm going to tell you that I feel paid. Right.  Applause  Thanks  that's lovely  and just the cup of tea  love  and just a splash of the whiskey. It's perfect  that's grand. Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect. What was your name  Peter  Is that right  so  Peter  Right. So that  that is the unique part of it for me  right  is that I ended up in both  first in the convent  and then in the prostitution after. That's right. So one woman at the university here in Dublin  she wrote about me. She said  Maureen Fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin dichotomy. Right   Laughter  Doesn't it sound like something you need to go into hospital  Well  I've got this terrible dichotomy. Doesn't it. Right. Well  for me though  it was  as a girl  it started with me dad. I mean  half the time  when he spoke to us  it was just a sort of tell us we were all useless rotten idiots and we had no morals  that type of thing. And I certainly didn't do myself any favors. By the time I was     I had started messing about with this older fella  and he wanted it to be our little secret  and I did as I was told  didn't I  and when that got back to me dad  he had me sent straightaway to the convent. Well no  that older fella  he would still come to find me in the convent. Yeah  he'd leave me notes tucked into the holes in the brick at the back of the charity shop so we could meet. And he'd tell me how he's leaving his wife  and I believed him  until I got pregnant. I did  Peter  and I left him a note about it in our special place there  and I never did hear from him again. No  I gave it up for adoption so it could have a decent life  and then they wouldn't let me back into the convent. No  my one sister Virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to Dublin  and that's how I ended up here. Well  surprise  surprise  I fell in love with another fella much older than me  and I always say I was just so happy because he didn't drink  I married the bastard. Well  he didn't drink  but he did have just the wee heroin problem  didn't he  and    That's right  and before I knew it  he was the one who turned me on to the prostitution  my own husband. He had me supporting the both of us. I was   . Well  it wasn't Pretty Woman  I can tell you that. That Julia Roberts  if she'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket  I don't think she'd ever have made that film. Well  for your record  my opinion of the legalization  I'd say I'm against it. I just  I don't care what these young girls say. You know  living like that  you're just lost  and  you know  I'm    years old. I'm still trying to find who I am. You know  I never was a wife or a nun  or a prostitute even  really  not really. Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be. They just told me  and if you legalize it  then you're really telling these girls   Go on and get lost for a living   and a lot of them  they'll do as they're told. All right  so four perspectives from four quite     Applause     four quite different voices there  right  One woman saying sex itself is natural but the sex industry seems to mechanize or industrialize it. Then the second woman considered sex work to be empowering  liberating  and feminist  though she  herself  notably  did not seem keen to do it. The third woman  who actually was a so called sex worker did not agree that it was liberating but she wanted the right to the economic empowerment  and then we hear the fourth woman saying not only prostitution itself but proscribed roles for women in general prevented her from ever finding who she was  right  So another fact most people did not know was the average age of an at risk girl being introduced to the sex industry was    or   . Also consider that the age when all girls in that society first became exposed to sexualized images of women was quite a bit earlier  right  This was a doll called Barbie  right  I initially thought she was an educational tool for anorexia prevention    but actually she was considered by many to be a wholesome symbol of femininity  and often young girls began what was called dieting. Remember this  This was restricting food intake on purpose by the age of six  and defining themselves based on attractiveness by around that same time. Right  Yes  Right  Bradley  okay  excellent point. So there was a lucrative market in that society in convincing all people they had to look a certain way to even have a sex life  right  But girls  especially  were expected to be  sexy  while avoiding being perceived as  sluts  for being sexual. Right  So there's that shame piece we've heard about. Yes. Valerie  right  Okay  very good. Of course  men were having sex as well  but you'll remember from the reading  what were male sluts called  Very good  they were called men. So not easy living in a world like that  right  Though it was not all bad news either. Most women in the early     s considered themselves empowered  and men generally felt they were also evolved in this area  and  in fact  most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking  for example  but they would have seen that as quite separate from more recreational adult entertainment. And so we'll just very briefly  class    we don't have a lot of time    we'll just very briefly hear from a man on our topic at this stage. So this next subject was interviewed on the night of his bachelor party. Dude  can you  all right  can you just keep it down  I'm trying to talk to BERT right now. Oh  your name's not BERT. BERT's the name of the  oh  all right. No  no  no  totally  it's totally fine. I'm mostly sober  so I just want to be helpful. Yeah  and I totally believe in causes  yeah  like  all that stuff. And actually  I'm wearing Toms right now. Yeah  Toms  like  the shoes  like  you buy a pair and then a kid in Africa gets clean water. Yeah. Totally. But what was the question again  Sorry. Of course I believe in women's rights. I'm marrying a woman. No  but I mean  like  just because I'm in a strip club parking lot doesn't mean that I'm  like  a sexist or whatever. My fiancee is totally amazing  she's totally a strong girl  woman  smart woman  like  the whole thing. Yeah  she knows I'm here. She's probably at a strip club herself right now  like  as a joke  same as me. My best man  I told him he could surprise me  and he thought this would be hilarious  but this is not something. Yeah  we all went to B school together. Wharton. Yeah  so  dude  can you guys    All right  but it's my bachelor party  and I can spend it in the parking lot with Anderson Cooper if I want to. All right  I'll see you in there. All right  okay  so Anderson  so  like  first of all  stripping  but then  like  all the other things you're talking about  prostitution and all that stuff  that's  like  not the same thing at all. You know  Like  you keep calling it the sex industry or whatever  but it's like  if the girl wants to be an exotic dancer and she's     like  that's her right. Whoa  whoa  I hear what you're saying  but I just feel like people  they just want to make it seem like all dudes are just  like  predators  that we would just automatically go to a prostitute  or whatever. Even  like  when I pledged  you know  like when I rushed my fraternity. My brothers who I'm close to  those guys  they're all like me. We're just normal people  but  like  there's this myth that you must be that guy who is kind of an asshole  and like  all bros before hos or whatever. And actually  like  bros before hos  it doesn't mean like what it sounds like. It's actually just like a joking way of saying that you care about your brothers and you put them first. Yeah  but  you can't blame the media  either. I mean  like  if you go watch  Hangover     and you think that's an instruction manual for your life  like  I don't know what to tell you. You know  You don't watch  Bourne Identity  and go drive your car over a gondola in Venice.  Laughter  Well  yeah  okay  like  if you're a little kid or whatever  of course it's different  but    Yeah  all right  I remember one thing like that. I was at this kid's house one time playing GTA  uh  Grand Theft Auto  Dude  are you from Canada   Laughter  So  like  whatever  with Grand Theft Auto  you're this kid  like  you're this guy walking around or whatever  and you can basically  like  the more cops you kill  the more points you get  and stuff like that. But also  you can find prostitutes and obviously you can do sexual stuff with them  but you can  like  kill them and take your money back. Yeah  this kid  I remember he ran over a couple of them a few times with his car and he got all these points. We were  like      I think. It felt pretty terrible  actually. No  I don't think I said anything  I just finished playing and went home. All right class  so then there were men who had more than just a passing relationship to this issue.  Laughter  The next subject described himself as a reformed and remorseful pimp turned motivational speaker  life coach and therapist  but if you want to know more about him  you'll have to come to the entire play. Thank you so much  you beautiful TED audience. I will see you for  Sell Buy Date.  I love a great mystery  and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science  perhaps because it's personal. It's about who we are  and I can't help but be curious. The mystery is this  What is the relationship between your brain and your conscious experiences  such as your experience of the taste of chocolate or the feeling of velvet  Now  this mystery is not new. In       Thomas Huxley wrote   How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as the result of irritating nervous tissue is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.  Now  Huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated  but he didn't know why. To the science of his day  it was a mystery. In the years since Huxley  science has learned a lot about brain activity  but the relationship between brain activity and conscious experiences is still a mystery. Why  Why have we made so little progress  Well  some experts think that we can't solve this problem because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence. We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics  and as it happens  we can't expect our species to solve this problem either. Well  I disagree. I'm more optimistic. I think we've simply made a false assumption. Once we fix it  we just might solve this problem. Today  I'd like tell you what that assumption is  why it's false  and how to fix it. Let's begin with a question  Do we see reality as it is  I open my eyes and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away. As a result  I come to believe that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away. I then close my eyes  and my experience changes to a gray field  but is it still the case that in reality  there's a red tomato a meter away  I think so  but could I be wrong  Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions  We have misinterpreted our perceptions before. We used to think the Earth is flat  because it looks that way. Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe  again because it looks that way. Copernicus and Galileo discovered  again  that we were wrong. Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences in other ways. He wrote   I think that tastes  odors  colors  and so on reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed  all these qualities would be annihilated.  Now  that's a stunning claim. Could Galileo be right  Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly  What does modern science have to say about this  Well  neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex is engaged in vision. When you simply open your eyes and look about this room  billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged. Now  this is a bit surprising  because to the extent that we think about vision at all  we think of it as like a camera. It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is. Now  there is a part of vision that's like a camera  the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye where there are     million photoreceptors  so the eye is like a     megapixel camera. But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision. What are these neurons up to  Well  neuroscientists tell us that they are creating  in real time  all the shapes  objects  colors  and motions that we see. It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is  but in fact  we're constructing everything that we see. We don't construct the whole world at once. We construct what we need in the moment. Now  there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see. I'll just show you two. In this example  you see some red discs with bits cut out of them  but if I just rotate the disks a little bit  suddenly  you see a  D cube pop out of the screen. Now  the screen of course is flat  so the three dimensional cube that you're experiencing must be your construction. In this next example  you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges moving across a field of dots. In fact  no dots move. All I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue. But when I do this quickly  your visual system creates the glowing blue bars with the sharp edges and the motion. There are many more examples  but these are just two that you construct what you see. But neuroscientists go further. They say that we reconstruct reality. So  when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato  that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction of the properties of a real red tomato that would exist even if I weren't looking. Now  why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct  we reconstruct  Well  the standard argument given is usually an evolutionary one. Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately  and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes. We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately  and so we can be confident that  in the normal case  our perceptions are accurate. You see this in the standard textbooks. One textbook says  for example   Evolutionarily speaking  vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate.  So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions. They give you a survival advantage. Now  is this correct  Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory  Well  let's first look at a couple of examples in nature. The Australian jewel beetle is dimpled  glossy and brown. The female is flightless. The male flies  looking  of course  for a hot female. When he finds one  he alights and mates. There's another species in the outback  Homo sapiens. The male of this species has a massive brain that he uses to hunt for cold beer. And when he finds one  he drains it  and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback. Now  as it happens  these bottles are dimpled  glossy  and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles. The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate. They lose all interest in the real females. Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle. The species almost went extinct. Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles. Now  the males had successfully found females for thousands  perhaps millions of years. It looked like they saw reality as it is  but apparently not. Evolution had given them a hack. A female is anything dimpled  glossy and brown  the bigger the better. Even when crawling all over the bottle  the male couldn't discover his mistake. Now  you might say  beetles  sure  they're very simple creatures  but surely not mammals. Mammals don't rely on tricks. Well  I won't dwell on this  but you get the idea.  Laughter  So this raises an important technical question  Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is  Fortunately  we don't have to wave our hands and guess  evolution is a mathematically precise theory. We can use the equations of evolution to check this out. We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete and see which survive and which thrive  which sensory systems are more fit. A key notion in those equations is fitness. Consider this steak  What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal  Well  for a hungry lion looking to eat  it enhances fitness. For a well fed lion looking to mate  it doesn't enhance fitness. And for a rabbit in any state  it doesn't enhance fitness  so fitness does depend on reality as it is  yes  but also on the organism  its state and its action. Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is  and it's fitness  and not reality as it is  that figures centrally in the equations of evolution. So  in my lab  we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations with lots of different randomly chosen worlds and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds. Some of the organisms see all of the reality  others see just part of the reality  and some see none of the reality  only fitness. Who wins  Well  I hate to break it to you  but perception of reality goes extinct. In almost every simulation  organisms that see none of reality but are just tuned to fitness drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is. So the bottom line is  evolution does not favor veridical  or accurate perceptions. Those perceptions of reality go extinct. Now  this is a bit stunning. How can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage  That is a bit counterintuitive. But remember the jewel beetle. The jewel beetle survived for thousands  perhaps millions of years  using simple tricks and hacks. What the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms  including us   are in the same boat as the jewel beetle. We do not see reality as it is. We're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive. Still  we need some help with our intuitions. How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful  Well  fortunately  we have a very helpful metaphor  the desktop interface on your computer. Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing. Now  the icon is blue and rectangular and in the lower right corner of the desktop. Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue  rectangular  and in the lower right hand corner of the computer  Of course not. Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface. It's not there to show you the reality of the computer. In fact  it's there to hide that reality. You don't want to know about the diodes and resistors and all the megabytes of software. If you had to deal with that  you could never write your text file or edit your photo. So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior. Space and time  as you perceive them right now  are your desktop. Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop. There's an obvious objection. Hoffman  if you think that train coming down the track at     MPH is just an icon of your desktop  why don't you step in front of it  And after you're gone  and your theory with you  we'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon. Well  I wouldn't step in front of that train for the same reason that I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can  not because I take the icon literally    the file is not literally blue or rectangular    but I do take it seriously. I could lose weeks of work. Similarly  evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive. We'd better take them seriously. If you see a snake  don't pick it up. If you see a cliff  don't jump off. They're designed to keep us safe  and we should take them seriously. That does not mean that we should take them literally. That's a logical error. Another objection  There's nothing really new here. Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around. There's nothing new here. Well  not exactly. It's like saying  I know that that blue icon on the desktop is not the reality of the computer  but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely  I see little pixels  and that's the reality of the computer. Well  not really    you're still on the desktop  and that's the point. Those microscopic particles are still in space and time  they're still in the user interface. So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists. Finally  you might object  look  we all see the train  therefore none of us constructs the train. But remember this example. In this example  we all see a cube  but the screen is flat  so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct. We all see a cube because we all  each one of us  constructs the cube that we see. The same is true of the train. We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct  and the same is true of all physical objects. We're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions. Instead  reality is more like a  D desktop that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world and guide adaptive behavior. Space as you perceive it is your desktop. Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop. We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way. Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality because it looks that way. We were wrong. We had misinterpreted our perceptions. Now we believe that spacetime and objects are the nature of reality as it is. The theory of evolution is telling us that once again  we're wrong. We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences. There's something that exists when you don't look  but it's not spacetime and physical objects. It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle. Why  Because we're blind to our own blindnesses. But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle  our science and technology. By peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality  and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality. When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato. Similarly  when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak  I'm interacting with reality  but that reality is not a lion or a steak. And here's the kicker  When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain  or neurons  I am interacting with reality  but that reality is not a brain or neurons and is nothing like a brain or neurons. And that reality  whatever it is  is the real source of cause and effect in the world    not brains  not neurons. Brains and neurons have no causal powers. They cause none of our perceptual experiences  and none of our behavior. Brains and neurons are a species specific set of symbols  a hack. What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness  Well  it opens up new possibilities. For instance  perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences. I doubt this  but it's worth exploring. Perhaps reality is some vast  interacting network of conscious agents  simple and complex  that cause each other's conscious experiences. Actually  this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems  and I'm currently exploring it. But here's the point  Once we let go of our massively intuitive but massively false assumption about the nature of reality  it opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery. I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating and unexpected than we've ever imagined. The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare  Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth  it's about having kids. And by the way  even this TED is just in your head. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  If that's really you there  thank you. So there's so much from this. I mean  first of all  some people may just be profoundly depressed at the thought that  if evolution does not favor reality  I mean  doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here  all our ability to think that we can think the truth  possibly even including your own theory  if you go there  Donald Hoffman  Well  this does not stop us from a successful science. What we have is one theory that turned out to be false  that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions. That theory turns out to be false. Okay  throw that theory away. That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories about the nature of reality  so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false. So science continues as normal. There's no problem here. CA  So you think it's possible     Laughter     This is cool  but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution can still get you to reason. DH  Yes. Now that's a very  very good point. The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception  and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped not to show us reality as it is  but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics. We haven't done these simulations  but my bet is that we'll find that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics to be at least in the direction of truth. I mean  if you're like me  math and logic is not easy. We don't get it all right  but at least the selection pressures are not uniformly away from true math and logic. So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty one at a time and see what evolution does to it. What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic. CA  I mean  really what you're proposing is a kind of modern day Bishop Berkeley interpretation of the world  consciousness causes matter  not the other way around. DH  Well  it's slightly different than Berkeley. Berkeley thought that  he was a deist  and he thought that the ultimate nature of reality is God and so forth  and I don't need to go where Berkeley's going  so it's quite a bit different from Berkeley. I call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach. CA  Don  I could literally talk with you for hours  and I hope to do that. Thanks so much for that. DH  Thank you.  Applause  The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass stained cathedral. I was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet  dip both hands into holy water  trace the trinity across my chest  my tiny body drooping  like a question mark all over the wooden pew. I asked Jesus to fix me  and when he did not answer I befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue  but shame lingered as an aftertaste. And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity  my mother told me of the miracle I was  said I could grow up  to be anything I want. I decided to be a boy. It was cute. I had snapback  toothless grin  used skinned knees as street cred  played hide and seek with  what was left of my goal. I was it. The winner to a game  the other kids couldn't play  I was the mystery of an anatomy  a question asked but not answered  tightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl  and when I turned     the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore. It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts  who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home  that I exist for heterosexual marriage and child bearing. And I swallowed their insults along with their slurs. Naturally  I did not come out of the closet. The kids at my school opened it without my permission. Called me by a name I did not recognize  said  lesbian   but I was more boy than girl  more Ken than Barbie. It had nothing to do with hating my body  I just love it enough to let it go  I treat it like a house  and when your house is falling apart  you do not evacuate  you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides  you make it pretty enough to invite guests over  you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on. My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall  Leelah Alcorn  Blake Brockington. She fears that I'll die without a whisper  that I'll turn into  what a shame  conversations at the bus stop. She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum  that I am a walking casket  news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle  Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk  at the bottom of equality pages. No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh  because people fear that my gender expression is a trick  that it exists to be perverse  that it ensnares them without their consent  that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer  they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like. They'll put me back into the closet  hang me with all the other skeletons. I will be the best attraction. Can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins  to misspell their names on gravestones. And people still wonder why there are boys rotting  they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. I wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant  before we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin way before we learn how to love them. Like God didn't save all this breath and mercy  like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet. My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. Maybe I am finally fixed  maybe I just don't care  maybe God finally listened to my prayers. Thank you. Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives  from our health and how we learn  to how we do business and make decisions  big ones and small. Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another. We've evolved to live in a world like this  but instead  we're living more and more of our lives like this    this is the text message from my daughter last night    in a world that's devoid of emotion. So I'm on a mission to change that. I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences. I started on this path    years ago. I was a computer scientist in Egypt  and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University. So I did something quite unusual for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife  With the support of my husband  who had to stay in Egypt  I packed my bags and I moved to England. At Cambridge  thousands of miles away from home  I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop than I did with any other human. Yet despite this intimacy  my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling. It had no idea if I was happy  having a bad day  or stressed  confused  and so that got frustrating. Even worse  as I communicated online with my family back home  I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace. I was homesick  I was lonely  and on some days I was actually crying  but all I had to communicate these emotions was this. Today's technology has lots of I.Q.  but no E.Q.  lots of cognitive intelligence  but no emotional intelligence. So that got me thinking  what if our technology could sense our emotions  What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly  just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would  Those questions led me and my team to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions  and our starting point was the human face. So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels that we all use to communicate social and emotional states  everything from enjoyment  surprise  empathy and curiosity. In emotion science  we call each facial muscle movement an action unit. So for example  action unit     it's not a Hollywood blockbuster  it is actually a lip corner pull  which is the main component of a smile. Try it everybody. Let's get some smiles going on. Another example is action unit  . It's the brow furrow. It's when you draw your eyebrows together and you create all these textures and wrinkles. We don't like them  but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion. So we have about    of these action units  and they combine to express hundreds of emotions. Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard  because these action units  they can be fast  they're subtle  and they combine in many different ways. So take  for example  the smile and the smirk. They look somewhat similar  but they mean very different things. So the smile is positive  a smirk is often negative. Sometimes a smirk can make you become famous. But seriously  it's important for a computer to be able to tell the difference between the two expressions. So how do we do that  We give our algorithms tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling  from different ethnicities  ages  genders  and we do the same for smirks. And then  using deep learning  the algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles and shape changes on our face  and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics  all smirks have subtly different characteristics. And the next time it sees a new face  it essentially learns that this face has the same characteristics of a smile  and it says   Aha  I recognize this. This is a smile expression.  So the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo  so I need a volunteer  preferably somebody with a face. Cloe's going to be our volunteer today. So over the past five years  we've moved from being a research project at MIT to a company  where my team has worked really hard to make this technology work  as we like to say  in the wild. And we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine works on any mobile device with a camera  like this iPad. So let's give this a try. As you can see  the algorithm has essentially found Cloe's face  so it's this white bounding box  and it's tracking the main feature points on her face  so her eyebrows  her eyes  her mouth and her nose. The question is  can it recognize her expression  So we're going to test the machine. So first of all  give me your poker face. Yep  awesome.  Laughter  And then as she smiles  this is a genuine smile  it's great. So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles. Now that was a big smile. Can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize  It does recognize subtle smiles as well. We've worked really hard to make that happen. And then eyebrow raised  indicator of surprise. Brow furrow  which is an indicator of confusion. Frown. Yes  perfect. So these are all the different action units. There's many more of them. This is just a slimmed down demo. But we call each reading an emotion data point  and then they can fire together to portray different emotions. So on the right side of the demo    look like you're happy. So that's joy. Joy fires up. And then give me a disgust face. Try to remember what it was like when Zayn left One Direction. Yeah  wrinkle your nose. Awesome. And the valence is actually quite negative  so you must have been a big fan. So valence is how positive or negative an experience is  and engagement is how expressive she is as well. So imagine if Cloe had access to this real time emotion stream  and she could share it with anybody she wanted to. Thank you. So  so far  we have amassed    billion of these emotion data points. It's the largest emotion database in the world. We've collected it from  .  million face videos  people who have agreed to share their emotions with us  and from    countries around the world. It's growing every day. It blows my mind away that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions  and we can do it at this scale. So what have we learned to date  Gender. Our data confirms something that you might suspect. Women are more expressive than men. Not only do they smile more  their smiles last longer  and we can now really quantify what it is that men and women respond to differently. Let's do culture  So in the United States  women are    percent more expressive than men  but curiously  we don't see any difference in the U.K. between men and women. Age  People who are    years and older are    percent more emotive than younger people. Women in their   s smile a lot more than men the same age  perhaps a necessity for dating. But perhaps what surprised us the most about this data is that we happen to be expressive all the time  even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone  and it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook. We are expressive when we're emailing  texting  shopping online  or even doing our taxes. Where is this data used today  In understanding how we engage with media  so understanding virality and voting behavior  and also empowering or emotion enabling technology  and I want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart. Emotion enabled wearable glasses can help individuals who are visually impaired read the faces of others  and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion  something that they really struggle with. In education  imagine if your learning apps sense that you're confused and slow down  or that you're bored  so it's sped up  just like a great teacher would in a classroom. What if your wristwatch tracked your mood  or your car sensed that you're tired  or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed  so it auto locks to prevent you from binge eating.  Laughter  I would like that  yeah. What if  when I was in Cambridge  I had access to my real time emotion stream  and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way  just like I would've if we were all in the same room together  I think five years down the line  all our devices are going to have an emotion chip  and we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device and our device would say   Hmm  you didn't like that  did you   Our biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology  my team and I realize that we can't build them all ourselves  so we've made this technology available so that other developers can get building and get creative. We recognize that there are potential risks and potential for abuse  but personally  having spent many years doing this  I believe that the benefits to humanity from having emotionally intelligent technology far outweigh the potential for misuse. And I invite you all to be part of the conversation. The more people who know about this technology  the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used. So as more and more of our lives become digital  we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices in order to reclaim our emotions. So what I'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology and make our technologies more responsive. So I want those devices that have separated us to bring us back together. And by humanizing technology  we have this golden opportunity to reimagine how we connect with machines  and therefore  how we  as human beings  connect with one another. Thank you. An evolutionary biologist at Purdue University named William Muir studied chickens. He was interested in productivity    I think it's something that concerns all of us    but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs. He wanted to know what could make his chickens more productive  so he devised a beautiful experiment. Chickens live in groups  so first of all  he selected just an average flock  and he let it alone for six generations. But then he created a second group of the individually most productive chickens    you could call them superchickens    and he put them together in a superflock  and each generation  he selected only the most productive for breeding. After six generations had passed  what did he find  Well  the first group  the average group  was doing just fine. They were all plump and fully feathered and egg production had increased dramatically. What about the second group  Well  all but three were dead. They'd pecked the rest to death. The individually productive chickens had only achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of the rest. Now  as I've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies  people have seen the relevance almost instantly  and they come up and they say things to me like   That superflock  that's my company.  Or   That's my country.  Or   That's my life.  All my life I've been told that the way we have to get ahead is to compete  get into the right school  get into the right job  get to the top  and I've really never found it very inspiring. I've started and run businesses because invention is a joy  and because working alongside brilliant  creative people is its own reward. And I've never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by superchickens or by superstars. But for the past    years  we've run most organizations and some societies along the superchicken model. We've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars  the brightest men  or occasionally women  in the room  and giving them all the resources and all the power. And the result has been just the same as in William Muir's experiment  aggression  dysfunction and waste. If the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest  then we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live. So what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others  Well  that's the question a team at MIT took to research. They brought in hundreds of volunteers  they put them into groups  and they gave them very hard problems to solve. And what happened was exactly what you'd expect  that some groups were very much more successful than others  but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high I.Q. Nor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest aggregate I.Q. Instead  they had three characteristics  the really successful teams. First of all  they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other. This is measured by something called the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. It's broadly considered a test for empathy  and the groups that scored highly on this did better. Secondly  the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other  so that no one voice dominated  but neither were there any passengers. And thirdly  the more successful groups had more women in them. Now  was this because women typically score more highly on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test  so you're getting a doubling down on the empathy quotient  Or was it because they brought a more diverse perspective  We don't really know  but the striking thing about this experiment is that it showed what we know  which is some groups do better than others  but what's key to that is their social connectedness to each other. So how does this play out in the real world  Well  it means that what happens between people really counts  because in groups that are highly attuned and sensitive to each other  ideas can flow and grow. People don't get stuck. They don't waste energy down dead ends. An example  Arup is one of the world's most successful engineering firms  and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the Beijing Olympics. Now  this building had to receive two and a half thousand really highly strung thoroughbred horses that were coming off long haul flights  highly jet lagged  not feeling their finest. And the problem the engineer confronted was  what quantity of waste to cater for  Now  you don't get taught this in engineering school     Laughter     and it's not really the kind of thing you want to get wrong  so he could have spent months talking to vets  doing the research  tweaking the spreadsheet. Instead  he asked for help and he found someone who had designed the Jockey Club in New York. The problem was solved in less than a day. Arup believes that the culture of helpfulness is central to their success. Now  helpfulness sounds really anemic  but it's absolutely core to successful teams  and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence. Helpfulness means I don't have to know everything  I just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help. At SAP  they reckon that you can answer any question in    minutes. But there isn't a single high tech company I've worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue  because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other. Now that sounds so obvious  and we think it'll just happen normally  but it doesn't. When I was running my first software company  I realized that we were getting stuck. There was a lot of friction  but not much else  and I gradually realized the brilliant  creative people that I'd hired didn't know each other. They were so focused on their own individual work  they didn't even know who they were sitting next to  and it was only when I insisted that we stop working and invest time in getting to know each other that we achieved real momentum. Now  that was    years ago  and now I visit companies that have banned coffee cups at desks because they want people to hang out around the coffee machines and talk to each other. The Swedes even have a special term for this. They call it fika  which means more than a coffee break. It means collective restoration. At Idexx  a company up in Maine  they've created vegetable gardens on campus so that people from different parts of the business can work together and get to know the whole business that way. Have they all gone mad  Quite the opposite    they've figured out that when the going gets tough  and it always will get tough if you're doing breakthrough work that really matters  what people need is social support  and they need to know who to ask for help. Companies don't have ideas  only people do. And what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other. What matters is the mortar  not just the bricks. Now  when you put all of this together  what you get is something called social capital. Social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust. The term comes from sociologists who were studying communities that proved particularly resilient in times of stress. Social capital is what gives companies momentum  and social capital is what makes companies robust. What does this mean in practical terms  It means that time is everything  because social capital compounds with time. So teams that work together longer get better  because it takes time to develop the trust you need for real candor and openness. And time is what builds value. When Alex Pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other  profits went up    million dollars  and employee satisfaction went up    percent. Not a bad return on social capital  which compounds even as you spend it. Now  this isn't about chumminess  and it's no charter for slackers  because people who work this way tend to be kind of scratchy  impatient  absolutely determined to think for themselves because that's what their contribution is. Conflict is frequent because candor is safe. And that's how good ideas turn into great ideas  because no idea is born fully formed. It emerges a little bit as a child is born  kind of messy and confused  but full of possibilities. And it's only through the generous contribution  faith and challenge that they achieve their potential. And that's what social capital supports. Now  we aren't really used to talking about this  about talent  about creativity  in this way. We're used to talking about stars. So I started to wonder  well  if we start working this way  does that mean no more stars  So I went and I sat in on the auditions at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. And what I saw there really surprised me  because the teachers weren't looking for individual pyrotechnics. They were looking for what happened between the students  because that's where the drama is. And when I talked to producers of hit albums  they said   Oh sure  we have lots of superstars in music. It's just  they don't last very long. It's the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers  because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves.  And when I went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity  I couldn't even see any superstars  because everybody there really mattered. And when I reflected on my own career  and the extraordinary people I've had the privilege to work with  I realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be superchickens. Once you appreciate truly how social work is  a lot of things have to change. Management by talent contest has routinely pitted employees against each other. Now  rivalry has to be replaced by social capital. For decades  we've tried to motivate people with money  even though we've got a vast amount of research that shows that money erodes social connectedness. Now  we need to let people motivate each other. And for years  we've thought that leaders were heroic soloists who were expected  all by themselves  to solve complex problems. Now  we need to redefine leadership as an activity in which conditions are created in which everyone can do their most courageous thinking together. We know that this works. When the Montreal Protocol called for the phasing out of CFCs  the chlorofluorocarbons implicated in the hole in the ozone layer  the risks were immense. CFCs were everywhere  and nobody knew if a substitute could be found. But one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles. The first was the head of engineering  Frank Maslen  said  there will be no stars in this team. We need everybody. Everybody has a valid perspective. Second  we work to one standard only  the best imaginable. And third  he told his boss  Geoff Tudhope  that he had to butt out  because he knew how disruptive power can be. Now  this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing. He gave the team air cover  and he listened to ensure that they honored their principles. And it worked  Ahead of all the other companies tackling this hard problem  this group cracked it first. And to date  the Montreal Protocol is the most successful international environmental agreement ever implemented. There was a lot at stake then  and there's a lot at stake now  and we won't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen. Now we need everybody  because it is only when we accept that everybody has value that we will liberate the energy and imagination and momentum we need to create the best beyond measure. Thank you. Just after Christmas last year      kids in California got the measles by either visiting Disneyland or being exposed to someone who'd been there. The virus then hopped the Canadian border  infecting more than     children in Quebec. One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles  which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system  is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world. An effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century  but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly even worse  autism. But wait    wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines debunked  retracted  and branded a deliberate fraud by the British Medical Journal  Don't most science savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.  I think most of you do  but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism. Why  Here's why. This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time. For most of the   th century  autism was considered an incredibly rare condition. The few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case. For decades  the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in       . But then  in the     s  the numbers started to skyrocket. Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic  as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland. So what's going on  If it isn't vaccines  what is it  If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta what's going on  they tend to rely on phrases like  broadened diagnostic criteria  and  better case finding  to explain these rising numbers. But that kind of language doesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two year old's face for eye contact. If the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened  why were they so narrow in the first place  Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the     s  Five years ago  I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions. I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science than it does with the seductive power of storytelling. For most of the   th century  clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered  but that story turned out to be wrong  and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health. There was a second  more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature. This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next. The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner. In       Kanner published a paper describing    young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds  ignoring the people around them  even their own parents. They could amuse themselves for hours by flapping their hands in front of their faces  but they were panicked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge. Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic  Kanner speculated that autism is very rare. By the     s  as the world's leading authority on the subject  he declared that he had seen less than     true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa. That's actually not surprising  because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective. For example  he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism. He once bragged that he had turned nine out of    kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis. Kanner was a smart guy  but a number of his theories didn't pan out. He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents. These children  he said  had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost. At the same time  however  Kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music  math and memory. One boy in his clinic could distinguish between    symphonies before he turned two. When his mother put on one of his favorite records  he would correctly declare   Beethoven   But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities  claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things they'd heard their pompous parents say  desperate to earn their approval. As a result  autism became a source of shame and stigma for families  and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good  becoming invisible to the world at large. Amazingly  it wasn't until the     s that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare. Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting were  bloody stupid   as she told me. She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people  and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie. Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie without support services  special education  and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis. To make the case to the National Health Service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families  Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done    years earlier. They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population. They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community. What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow  while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse. Some kids couldn't talk at all  while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics  dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty. In other words  these children didn't fit into nice  neat boxes  as Judith put it  and they saw lots of them  way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted. At first  they were at a loss to make sense of their data. How had no one noticed these children before  But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in German in       the year after Kanner's paper  and then forgotten  buried with the ashes of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about. Kanner knew about this competing paper  but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work. It had never even been translated into English  but luckily  Lorna's husband spoke German  and he translated it for her. The paper offered an alternate story of autism. Its author was a man named Hans Asperger  who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the     s. Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards. Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music  and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons. Instead of blaming parents for causing autism  Asperger framed it as a lifelong  polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one's whole life. Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients  Asperger called them his little professors  and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them. Crucially  Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability. He believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been  seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the absent minded professor. He went so far as to say  it seems that for success in science and art  a dash of autism is essential. Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it. Over the next several years  they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called  the autism spectrum.  In the late '  s and early     s  their changes went into effect  swapping out Kanner's narrow model for Asperger's broad and inclusive one. These changes weren't happening in a vacuum. By coincidence  as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria  people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time. Before  Rain Man  came out in       only a tiny  ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like  but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt earned  Rain Man  four Academy Awards  pediatricians  psychologists  teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like. Coincidentally  at the same time  the first easy to use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced. You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child evaluated. The combination of  Rain Man   the changes to the criteria  and the introduction of these tests created a network effect  a perfect storm of autism awareness. The number of diagnoses started to soar  just as Lorna and Judith predicted  indeed hoped  that it would  enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved. Then Andrew Wakefield came along to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines  a simple  powerful  and seductively believable story that was as wrong as Kanner's theory that autism was rare. If the CDC's current estimate  that one in    kids in America are on the spectrum  is correct  autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world. In recent years  autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough  coining the term  neurodiversity  to celebrate the varieties of human cognition. One way to understand neurodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems. Just because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken. By autistic standards  the normal human brain is easily distractable  obsessively social  and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail. To be sure  autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them.  Seventy  years later  we're still catching up to Asperger  who believed that the  cure  for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers  accommodating employers  supportive communities  and parents who have faith in their children's potential. An autistic  man  named Zosia Zaks once said   We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity.  As we sail into an uncertain future  we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society. We can't afford to waste a brain. Thank you. Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River  Braddock  Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County  approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. An industrial suburb  Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill  the Edgar Thomson Works. Operating since       it is the last functioning steel mill in the region. For    years  I have produced collaborative portraits  still lifes  landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry  the environment  and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community. The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions. Currently  the new narrative about Braddock  a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization  is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier. Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black. Our existence has been co opted  silenced and erased. Fourth generation in a lineage of women  I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby  off  th Street at     Washington Avenue. She worked as a manager for Goodwill. Mom was a nurse's aid. She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments. By the time my generation walked the streets  disinvestment at the local  state and federal level  eroded infrastructure  and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension. He worked in high temperatures  tearing down and rebuilding furnaces  cleaning up spilt metal and slag. The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape. Areas of heavy truck traffic  exposure to benzene and atomized metals  risk cancer and lupus. One hundred twenty three licensed beds      employees  rehabilitation programs decimated. A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood. Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared. Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land. In       I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession. In flight  my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. My work spirals from the micro to the macro level  excavating hidden histories. Recently  at the Seattle Art Museum  Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition  and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice. Through reclamation of our narrative  we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. Thank you. I am failing as a woman  I am failing as a feminist. I have passionate opinions about gender equality  but I worry that to freely accept the label of  feminist   would not be fair to good feminists. I'm a feminist  but I'm a rather bad one. Oh  so I call myself a Bad Feminist. Or at least  I wrote an essay  and then I wrote a book called  Bad Feminist   and then in interviews  people started calling me The Bad Feminist. So  what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation  has become a thing. Let me take a step back. When I was younger  mostly in my teens and   s  I had strange ideas about feminists as hairy  angry  man hating  sex hating women    as if those are bad things. These days  I look at how women are treated the world over  and anger  in particular  seems like a perfectly reasonable response. But back then  I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a feminist. The feminist label was an accusation  it was an  F  word  and not a nice one. I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules  who expects too much  who thinks far too highly of myself  by daring to believe I'm equal     Coughs     superior to a man. You don't want to be that rebel woman  until you realize that you very much are that woman  and cannot imagine being anyone else. As I got older  I began to accept that I am  indeed  a feminist  and a proud one. I hold certain truths to be self evident  Women are equal to men. We deserve equal pay for equal work. We have the right to move through the world as we choose  free from harassment or violence. We have the right to easy  affordable access to birth control  and reproductive services. We have the right to make choices about our bodies  free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine. We have the right to respect. There's more. When we talk about the needs of women  we have to consider the other identities we inhabit. We are not just women. We are people with different bodies  gender expressions  faiths  sexualities  class backgrounds  abilities  and so much more. We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us  as much as we account for what we have in common. Without this kind of inclusion  our feminism is nothing. I hold these truths to be self evident  but let me be clear  I'm a mess. I am full of contradictions. There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong. I have another confession. When I drive to work  I listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume. Even though the lyrics are degrading to women    these lyrics offend me to my core    the classic Yin Yang Twins song  Salt Shaker     it is amazing.  Make it work with your wet t shirt. Bitch  you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt   Think about it. Poetry  right  I am utterly mortified by my music choices. I firmly believe in man work  which is anything I don't want to do  including    all domestic tasks  but also  bug killing  trash removal  lawn care and vehicle maintenance. I want no part of any of that. Pink is my favorite color. I enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things. I watch  The Bachelor  and romantic comedies  and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true. Some of my transgressions are more flagrant. If a woman wants to take her husband's name  that is her choice  and it is not my place to judge. If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children  I embrace that choice  too. The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice  the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose. Let's deal with that. I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color  working class women  queer women and transgender women  in favor of supporting white  middle  and upper class straight women. Listen  if that's good feminism    I am a very bad feminist. There is also this  As a feminist  I feel a lot of pressure. We have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal. We expect them to pose perfectly. When they disappoint us  we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on. Like I said  I am a mess    consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there. Too many women  particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders  are afraid to be labeled as feminists. They're afraid to stand up and say   Yes  I am a feminist   for fear of what that label means  for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations. Take  for example  Beyonc   or as I call her  The Goddess. She has emerged  in recent years  as a visible feminist. At the      MTV Video Music Awards  she performed in front of the word  feminist     feet high. It was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men know that being a feminist is something to celebrate. As the moment faded  cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyonc  was  indeed  a feminist. They graded her feminism  instead of simply taking a grown  accomplished woman at her word. We demand perfection from feminists  because we are still fighting for so much  we want so much  we need so damn much. We go far beyond reasonable  constructive criticism  to dissecting any given woman's feminism  tearing it apart until there's nothing left. We do not need to do that. Bad feminism    or really  more inclusive feminism    is a starting point. But what happens next  We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability  or walking the walk  and being a little bit brave. If I listen to degrading music  I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply. These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line. Certainly  it is difficult. Why must it be so catchy  It's hard to make the better choice  and it is so easy to justify a lesser one. But    when I justify bad choices  I make it harder for women to achieve equality  the equality that we all deserve  and I need to own that. I think of my nieces  ages three and four. They are gorgeous and headstrong  brilliant girls  who are a whole lot of brave. I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are. I think of them  and suddenly  the better choice becomes far easier to make. We can all make better choices. We can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport  Game of Thrones. We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing. We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don't treat women as anything more than decorative objects. We can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat  their partners like punching bags. In other ways  men    and especially straight white men    can say   No  I will not publish with your magazine  or participate in your project  or otherwise work with you  until you include a fair number of women  both as participants and decision makers. I won't work with you until your publication  or your organization  is more inclusive of all kinds of difference.  Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects  can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling  and we are tokens no more. Without these efforts  without taking these stands  our accomplishments are going to mean very little. We can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power    editors  movie and music producers  CEOs  lawmakers    the people who can make bigger  braver choices to create lasting  meaningful change. We can also boldly claim our feminism    good  bad  or anywhere in between. The last line of my book  Bad Feminist  says   I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all.  This is true for so many reasons  but first and foremost  I say this because once upon a time  my voice was stolen from me  and feminism helped me to get my voice back. There was an incident. I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened. Some boys broke me  when I was so young  I did not know what boys can do to break a girl. They treated me like I was nothing. I began to believe I was nothing. They stole my voice  and in the after  I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter. But    I had writing. And there  I wrote myself back together. I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself. I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine  and women who looked like me  and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin. I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing. I learned to write like them  and then I learned to write as myself. I found my voice again  and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure. Through writing and feminism  I also found that if I was a little bit brave  another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are. In one hand  I hold the power to accomplish anything. And in my other  I hold the humbling reality that I am just one woman. I am a bad feminist  I am a good woman  I am trying to become better in how I think  and what I say  and what I do  without abandoning everything that makes me human. I hope that we can all do the same. I hope that we can all be a little bit brave  when we most need such bravery. Blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah  blah blah  blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah  blah. So what the hell was that  Well  you don't know because you couldn't understand it. It wasn't clear. But hopefully  it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious. Clarity or mystery  I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer  as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day  and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me. Here's an example. Now  how many people know what this is  Okay. Now how many people know what this is  Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz  we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life  one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over    years. This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art  which will be coming out this fall  and that is the entire cover. There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front  and the name of the book is  Only What's Necessary.  So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I'm perceiving  and the design I'm creating. So clarity. Clarity gets to the point. It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere. We ask ourselves this.   When should you be clear    Now  something like this  whether we can read it or not  needs to be really  really clear. Is it  This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love  mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry. So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners  I was thrilled  because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car. Six  I can do that.  Laughter  So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang  and that is mystery. Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition. Mystery demands to be decoded  and when it's done right  we really  really want to.   When should you be mysterious    In World War II  the Germans really  really wanted to decode this  and they couldn't. Here's an example of a design that I've done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami  who I've done design work for for over    years now  and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden  after their freshman year of college  completely cut him off with no explanation  and he is devastated. And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color. So there's Mr. Red  there's Mr. Blue  there's Ms. White  and Ms. Black. Tsukuru Tazaki  his name does not correspond to a color  so his nickname is Colorless  and as he's looking back on their friendship  he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand. So I created this sort of abstract representation of this  but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story  and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket. The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system  which has significance within the story. And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors  which basically he does later on in the story. He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did. And so this is the three dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office  and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like  and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.   The Visual Vernacular.   This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery. What does this mean  This is what it means.   Make it look like something else.   The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way. This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time.   All the Beauty You Will Ever Need   Now  the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing. It's not connected to any of the essays in the book. It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream. Thank you very much  so     Laughter     so usually  I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text  but this is all the text there is. So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything  so I was trying to think  Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't  And sure enough  not long after  one evening after a Chinese meal  this arrived  and I thought   Ah  bing  ideagasm    Laughter  I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but when you think about them    if you think about them    they really don't. This says   Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future.  Thank you.  Laughter  But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris  and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore. We're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris  and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.   'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff   David Rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book  Fraud  because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do. So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive. And then he would write about it  and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself. And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it. This led me to graffiti. I'm fascinated by graffiti. I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time  and there's all different sorts of it. This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy. Now whether you look at this and think   Oh  that's a charming urban affectation   or you look at it and say   That's illegal abuse of property   the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it. Right  There is no clear message here. There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting  which I call editorial graffiti. This is a picture I took recently in the subway  and sometimes you see lots of prurient  stupid stuff  but I thought this was interesting  and this is a poster that is saying rah rah Airbnb  and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it. And it got my attention. So I was thinking  how do we apply this to this book  So I get the book by this person  and I start reading it  and I'm thinking  this guy is not who he says  he is  he's a fraud. And I get out a red Magic Marker  and out of frustration just scribble this across the front. Design done.  Laughter  And they went for it   Laughter  Author liked it  publisher liked it  and that is how the book went out into the world  and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you  and they all sort of looked like they were crazy.   'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy   Okay  James Ellroy  amazing crime writer  a good friend  I've worked with him for many years. He is probably best known as the author of  The Black Dahlia  and  L.A. Confidential.  His most recent novel was called this  which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means  but a lot of people don't. And it's a story about a Japanese American detective in Los Angeles in      investigating a murder. And then Pearl Harbor happens  and as if his life wasn't difficult enough  now the race relations have really ratcheted up  and then the Japanese American internment camps are quickly created  and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder. And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of all right  we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city. And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles. My editor in chief said   You know  it's interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler.  And so I went back to the drawing board  as I often do. But also  being alive to my surroundings  I work in a high rise in Midtown  and every night  before I leave the office  I have to push this button to get out  and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator. And one night  all of a sudden  I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before. Big red circle  danger. And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times  and so I did a Google image search  and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this  and so this is really what solved the problem  and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.   'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach.   Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all  she makes them really fun. So in this particular case  it's about the human digestive system. So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be. This is a self portrait.  Laughter  Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black. And if it's not  I'm good to go. I recommend you all do this. But I also started thinking  here's our introduction. Right  Into the human digestive system. But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths  at least based on this  are off putting.  Laughter  So for the cover  then  I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system from this end. I don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.   Unuseful mystery   What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up  And we see this all the time. This is what I call unuseful mystery. I go down into the subway    I take the subway a lot    and this piece of paper is taped to a girder. Right  And now I'm thinking  uh oh  and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means  and thanks a lot. Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful  and frankly  I don't think it is at all. So this is mystery we do not need. What we need is useful clarity  so just for fun  I redesigned this. This is using all the same elements. Thank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA.  Laughter  You know  I'm actually not even using more colors than they use. They just didn't even bother to make the   and the   green  those idiots.  Laughter  So the first thing we see is that there is a service change  and then  in two complete sentences with a beginning  a middle and an end  it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening. Call me crazy   Laughter    Useful mystery   All right. Now  here is a piece of mystery that I love  packaging. This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art. It's a work of art. It's beautiful. But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke    the typefaces  the colors  the silver background    and he's reduced them to their most essential parts  so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face. It's like  how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing  It looks great  and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf  and it's wonderful. Which makes the next thing      Unuseful clarity      all the more disheartening  at least to me. So okay  again  going back down into the subway  after this came out  these are pictures that I took. Times Square subway station  Coca Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay  And maybe some of you know where this is going. Ahem.  You moved to New York with the clothes on your back  the cash in your pocket  and your eyes on the prize. You're on Coke.   Laughter   You moved to New York with an MBA  one clean suit  and an extremely firm handshake. You're on Coke.   Laughter  These are real   Laughter  Not even the support beams were spared  except they switched into Yoda mode.  Laughter   Coke you're on.   Laughter    Excuse me  I'm on WHAT     This campaign was a huge misstep. It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web    and also that dot next to  You're on   that's not a period  that's a trademark. So thanks a lot. So to me  this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so unbearably  clearly wrong. It was just incredible to me. So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work  and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life  or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over sharing. And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk  I hope it's this  Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.   'Judge This ' Chip Kidd   Blih blih blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah. This is my great uncle  my father's father's younger brother. His name was Joe McKenna. He was a young husband and a semi pro basketball player and a fireman in New York City. Family history says he loved being a fireman  and so in       on one of his days off  he elected to hang out at the firehouse. To make himself useful that day  he started polishing all the brass  the railings on the fire truck  the fittings on the walls  and one of the fire hose nozzles  a giant  heavy piece of metal  toppled off a shelf and hit him. A few days later  his shoulder started to hurt. Two days after that  he spiked a fever. The fever climbed and climbed. His wife was taking care of him  but nothing she did made a difference  and when they got the local doctor in  nothing he did mattered either. They flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital. The nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection  what at the time they would have called  blood poisoning   and though they probably didn't say it  they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do. There was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections didn't exist yet. The first test of penicillin  the first antibiotic  was three years in the future. People who got infections either recovered  if they were lucky  or they died. My great uncle was not lucky. He was in the hospital for a week  shaking with chills  dehydrated and delirious  sinking into a coma as his organs failed. His condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood. Nothing worked. He died. He was    years old. If you look back through history  most people died the way my great uncle died. Most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease  the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today. They didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough to develop them. They died of injuries    being gored by an ox  shot on a battlefield  crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution    and most of the time from infection  which finished what those injuries began. All of that changed when antibiotics arrived. Suddenly  infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days. It seemed like a miracle  and ever since  we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs. And now  we are coming to an end of it. My great uncle died in the last days of the pre antibiotic era. We stand today on the threshold of the post antibiotic era  in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one Joe had will kill people once again. In fact  they already are. People are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance. Briefly  it works like this. Bacteria compete against each other for resources  for food  by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other. Other bacteria  to protect themselves  evolve defenses against that chemical attack. When we first made antibiotics  we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them  and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had. Here is what happened next  Penicillin was distributed in       and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by     . Vancomycin arrived in       vancomycin resistance in     . Imipenem in       and resistance to in     . Daptomycin  one of the most recent drugs  in       and resistance to it just a year later in     . For    years  we played a game of leapfrog    our drug and their resistance  and then another drug  and then resistance again    and now the game is ending. Bacteria develop resistance so quickly that pharmaceutical companies have decided making antibiotics is not in their best interest  so there are infections moving across the world for which  out of the more than     antibiotics available on the market  two drugs might work with side effects  or one drug  or none. This is what that looks like. In       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the CDC  identified a single case in a hospital in North Carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs. Today  that infection  known as KPC  has spread to every state but three  and to South America  Europe and the Middle East. In       doctors in Sweden diagnosed a man from India with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time. The gene that creates that resistance  known as NDM  has now spread from India into China  Asia  Africa  Europe and Canada  and the United States. It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases  but in fact  in the United States and Europe         people a year die of infections which no drugs can help. A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year. That is a lot of deaths  and yet  the chances are good that you don't feel at risk  that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives  people whose infections are remote from us  in situations we can't identify with. What you didn't think about  none of us do  is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life. If we lost antibiotics  here's what else we'd lose  First  any protection for people with weakened immune systems    cancer patients  AIDS patients  transplant recipients  premature babies. Next  any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body  stents for stroke  pumps for diabetes  dialysis  joint replacements. How many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees  A recent study estimates that without antibiotics  one out of ever six would die. Next  we'd probably lose surgery. Many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics. Without that protection  we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body. So no heart operations  no prostate biopsies  no Cesarean sections. We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor. Strep throat used to cause heart failure. Skin infections led to amputations. Giving birth killed  in the cleanest hospitals  almost one woman out of every    . Pneumonia took three children out of every   . More than anything else  we'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives. If you knew that any injury could kill you  would you ride a motorcycle  bomb down a ski slope  climb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights  let your kid slide into home plate  After all  the first person to receive penicillin  a British policeman named Albert Alexander  who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye  was infected by doing something very simple. He walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn. That British project I mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is         deaths a year also predicts that if we can't get this under control by       not long  the worldwide toll will be    million deaths a year. How did we get to this point where what we have to look forward to is those terrifying numbers  The difficult answer is  we did it to ourselves. Resistance is an inevitable biological process  but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it. We did this by squandering antibiotics with a heedlessness that now seems shocking. Penicillin was sold over the counter until the     s. In much of the developing world  most antibiotics still are. In the United States     percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary. Forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor's offices are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help. And that's just in healthcare. On much of the planet  most meat animals get antibiotics every day of their lives  not to cure illnesses  but to fatten them up and to protect them against the factory farm conditions they are raised in. In the United States  possibly    percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals  not to humans  creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water  in dust  in the meat the animals become. Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too  particularly in Asia  and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples  pears  citrus  against disease. And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport  once we have encouraged that resistance into existence  there is no knowing where it will spread. This was predictable. In fact  it was predicted by Alexander Fleming  the man who discovered penicillin. He was given the Nobel Prize in      in recognition  and in an interview shortly after  this is what he said   The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a man who succumbs to infection with a pencillin resistant organism.  He added   I hope this evil can be averted.  Can we avert it  There are companies working on novel antibiotics  things the superbugs have never seen before. We need those new drugs badly  and we need incentives  discovery grants  extended patents  prizes  to lure other companies into making antibiotics again. But that probably won't be enough. Here's why  Evolution always wins. Bacteria birth a new generation every    minutes. It takes pharmaceutical chemistry    years to derive a new drug. Every time we use an antibiotic  we give the bacteria billions of chances to crack the codes of the defenses we've constructed. There has never yet been a drug they could not defeat. This is asymmetric warfare  but we can change the outcome. We could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically how antibiotics are being used. We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look. We could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use. We could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next. Those are the tech solutions. They probably aren't enough either  unless we help. Antibiotic resistance is a habit. We all know how hard it is to change a habit. But as a society  we've done that in the past. People used to toss litter into the streets  used to not wear seatbelts  used to smoke inside public buildings. We don't do those things anymore. We don't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer  because we decided those things were expensive  destructive  not in our best interest. We changed social norms. We could change social norms around antibiotic use too. I know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming  but if you've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change  or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil  you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step to address an overwhelming problem. We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too. We could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one. We could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection before we're sure what caused it. We could ask every restaurant  every supermarket  where their meat comes from. We could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use  and if we did those things  we could slow down the arrival of the post antibiotic world. But we have to do it soon. Penicillin began the antibiotic era in     . In just    years  we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster. We won't get    years to find our way back out again. Thank you very much. So in       Karl Benz invented the automobile. Later that year  he took it out for the first public test drive  and    true story    crashed into a wall. For the last     years  we've been working around that least reliable part of the car  the driver. We've made the car stronger. We've added seat belts  we've added air bags  and in the last decade  we've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug  the driver. Now  today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self driving cars and what they can do for the world. I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does  but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem. And it's a big problem   .  million people are killed on the world's roads every year. In America alone         people are killed each year. To put that in perspective  that's the same as a     falling out of the sky every working day. It's kind of unbelievable. Cars are sold to us like this  but really  this is what driving's like. Right  It's not sunny  it's rainy  and you want to do anything other than drive. And the reason why is this  Traffic is getting worse. In America  between      and       the vehicle miles traveled increased by    percent. We grew by six percent of roads  so it's not in your brains. Traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago. And all of this has a very human cost. So if you take the average commute time in America  which is about    minutes  you multiply that by the     million workers we have  that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day. Now  that's a big number  so let's put it in perspective. You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person  that turns out to be     lifetimes spent every day  wasted  just getting from A to B. It's unbelievable. And then  there are those of us who don't have the privilege of sitting in traffic. So this is Steve. He's an incredibly capable guy  but he just happens to be blind  and that means instead of a    minute drive to work in the morning  it's a two hour ordeal of piecing together bits of public transit or asking friends and family for a ride. He doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around. We should do something about that. Now  conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them  and over time  they'll turn into self driving cars. Well  I'm here to tell you that's like me saying that if I work really hard at jumping  one day I'll be able to fly. We actually need to do something a little different. And so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self driving systems are different than driver assistance systems. And I'm going to start with some of our own experience. So back in       we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people use it. Well  almost regular    they were     Googlers  but they weren't working on the project. And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives. But unlike a real self driving car  this one had a big asterisk with it  They had to pay attention  because this was an experimental vehicle. We tested it a lot  but it could still fail. And so we gave them two hours of training  we put them in the car  we let them use it  and what we heard back was something awesome  as someone trying to bring a product into the world. Every one of them told us they loved it. In fact  we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day   This is completely stupid. What are we thinking   But at the end of it  he said   Not only should I have it  everyone else should have it  because people are terrible drivers.  So this was music to our ears  but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing  and this was eye opening. Now  my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low  so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack  pulls out his laptop  puts it on the seat  goes in the back again  digs around  pulls out the charging cable for his phone  futzes around  puts it into the laptop  puts it on the phone. Sure enough  the phone is charging. All the time he's been doing    miles per hour down the freeway. Right  Unbelievable. So we thought about this and we said  it's kind of obvious  right  The better the technology gets  the less reliable the driver is going to get. So by just making the cars incrementally smarter  we're probably not going to see the wins we really need. Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here. So we're looking at this graph  and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't. You can ignore most of that axis  because if you're driving around town  and the car starts stopping randomly  you're never going to buy that car. And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident. Now  if we look at the bottom left corner here  this is your classic car. It doesn't apply the brakes for you  it doesn't do anything goofy  but it also doesn't get you out of an accident. Now  if we want to bring a driver assistance system into a car  say with collision mitigation braking  we're going to put some package of technology on there  and that's this curve  and it's going to have some operating properties  but it's never going to avoid all of the accidents  because it doesn't have that capability. But we'll pick some place along the curve here  and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses  and that's amazing  right  We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two. There are now        less people dying every year in America. But if we want a self driving car  we need a technology curve that looks like this. We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle  and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash. They'll happen  but very low frequency. Now you and I could look at this and we could argue about whether it's incremental  and I could say something like        rule   and it's really hard to move up to that new curve. But let's look at it from a different direction for a moment. So let's look at how often the technology has to do the right thing. And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system. It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every         miles in America. In contrast  a self driving system is probably making decisions about    times per second  so order of magnitude  that's about       times per mile. So if you compare the distance between these two  it's about    to the eighth  right  Eight orders of magnitude. That's like comparing how fast I run to the speed of light. It doesn't matter how hard I train  I'm never actually going to get there. So there's a pretty big gap there. And then finally  there's how the system can handle uncertainty. So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road  might not be. I can't tell  nor can any of our algorithms  but in the case of a driver assistance system  that means it can't take action  because again  if it presses the brakes unexpectedly  that's completely unacceptable. Whereas a self driving system can look at that pedestrian and say  I don't know what they're about to do  slow down  take a better look  and then react appropriately after that. So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be. So that's enough about the differences between the two. Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world. So this is our vehicle. It starts by understanding where it is in the world  by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two  and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment. So here  all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road  and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist  and up in the distance  if you look really closely  you can see some cones. Then we know where the car is in the moment  but we have to do better than that  we have to predict what's going to happen. So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed  so it needs to get out of the way. Knowing that one pickup truck is great  but we really need to know what everybody's thinking  so it becomes quite a complicated problem. And then given that  we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment  so what trajectory it should follow  how quickly it should slow down or speed up. And then that all turns into just following a path  turning the steering wheel left or right  pressing the brake or gas. It's really just two numbers at the end of the day. So how hard can it really be  Back when we started in       this is what our system looked like. So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road  driving down the highway. The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are. It's really a geometric understanding of the world. Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets  the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty. You see pedestrians crossing in front of us  cars crossing in front of us  going every which way  the traffic lights  crosswalks. It's an incredibly complicated problem by comparison. And then once you have that problem solved  the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction. So here are the cones on the left forcing it to drive to the right  but not just construction in isolation  of course. It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well. And of course  if anyone's breaking the rules  the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it's not just a car  it's actually a police officer. Similarly  the orange box on the side here  it's a school bus  and we have to treat that differently as well. When we're out on the road  other people have expectations  So  when a cyclist puts up their arm  it means they're expecting the car to yield to them and make room for them to make a lane change. And when a police officer stood in the road  our vehicle should understand that this means stop  and when they signal to go  we should continue. Now  the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles. The first  most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone  having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty. But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this. We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time  the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians  cyclists  and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like. And then  even more importantly  we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world. So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us. Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right. Here there's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road. Here somebody makes a right turn  and in a moment here  somebody's going to make a U turn in front of us  and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely. Now  that's all well and good for things that we've seen  but of course  you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before. And so just a couple of months ago  our vehicles were driving through Mountain View  and this is what we encountered. This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road.  Laughter  Now it turns out  there is nowhere in the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that  but our vehicles were able to encounter that  slow down  and drive safely. Now  we don't have to deal with just ducks. Watch this bird fly across in front of us. The car reacts to that. Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View. And of course  we have to deal with drivers  even the very small ones. Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us. And now  watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment. Here  as we make a lane change  the car to our left decides it wants to as well. And here  we watch a car blow through a red light and yield to it. And similarly  here  a cyclist blowing through that light as well. And of course  the vehicle responds safely. And of course  we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road  like this guy pulling out between two self driving cars. You have to ask   What are you thinking   Now  I just fire hosed you with a lot of stuff there  so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly. So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again  and you might notice in the bottom  we can't actually see the cyclist yet  but the car can  it's that little blue box up there  and that comes from the laser data. And that's not actually really easy to understand  so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it  and if you're really good at looking at laser data  you can see a few dots on the curve there  right there  and that blue box is that cyclist. Now as our light is red  the cyclist's light has turned yellow already  and if you squint  you can see that in the imagery. But the cyclist  we see  is going to proceed through the intersection. Our light has now turned green  his is solidly red  and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across. Unfortunately the other drivers next to us were not paying as much attention. They started to pull forward  and fortunately for everyone  this cyclists reacts  avoids  and makes it through the intersection. And off we go. Now  as you can see  we've made some pretty exciting progress  and at this point we're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market. We do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day  so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have. We are looking forward to having this technology on the road  and we think the right path is to go through the self driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large. In the time I have given this talk today     people have died on America's roads. How soon can we bring it out  Well  it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem  but these are my two boys. My oldest son is     and that means in four and a half years  he's going to be able to get his driver's license. My team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Chris  I've got a question for you. Chris Urmson  Sure. CA  So certainly  the mind of your cars is pretty mind boggling. On this debate between driver assisted and fully driverless    I mean  there's a real debate going on out there right now. So some of the companies  for example  Tesla  are going the driver assisted route. What you're saying is that that's kind of going to be a dead end because you can't just keep improving that route and get to fully driverless at some point  and then a driver is going to say   This feels safe   and climb into the back  and something ugly will happen. CU  Right. No  that's exactly right  and it's not to say that the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable. They can save a lot of lives in the interim  but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around  to really get to the end case in safety  to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots  it's the only way to go. CA  We will be tracking your progress with huge interest. Thanks so much  Chris. CU  Thank you.  Applause  When you're a child  anything and everything is possible. The challenge  so often  is hanging on to that as we grow up. And as a four year old  I had the opportunity to sail for the first time. I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast. I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time. But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom  the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails. As a four year old child  it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine. I made my mind up there and then that one day  somehow  I was going to sail around the world. So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream. Age     it was saving my school dinner money change. Every single day for eight years  I had mashed potato and baked beans  which cost  p each  and gravy was free. Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box  and when that pile reached a pound  I would drop it in and cross off one of the     squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper. Finally  I bought a tiny dinghy. I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal. I read every book I could on sailing  and then eventually  having been told by my school I wasn't clever enough to be a vet  left school age    to begin my apprenticeship in sailing. So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true. I felt like my life depended on that moment  and incredibly  he said yes. And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world. From that first meeting to the finish line of the race  it was everything I'd ever imagined. Just like in my dreams  there were amazing parts and tough parts. We missed an iceberg by    feet. Nine times  I climbed to the top of her    foot mast. We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean. But the sunsets  the wildlife  and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking. After three months at sea  age just     I finished in second position. I'd loved it  so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again  but this time not in a race  to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world. Now for this  I needed a different craft  bigger  wider  faster  more powerful. Just to give that boat some scale  I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top. Seventy five foot long     foot wide. I affectionately called her Moby. She was a multihull. When we built her  no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one  though many had tried  but whilst we built her  a Frenchman took a boat    percent bigger than her and not only did he make it  but he took the record from    days right down to   . The bar was now much  much higher. And these boats were exciting to sail. This was a training sail off the French coast. This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board. Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater  and that five seconds goes quickly. Just see how far below those guys the sea is. Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean plunged into icy water  thousands of miles away from land. It was Christmas Day. I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia. The conditions were horrendous. I was approaching a part in the ocean which was       miles away from the nearest town. The nearest land was Antarctica  and the nearest people would be those manning the European Space Station above me. You really are in the middle of nowhere. If you need help  and you're still alive  it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port. No helicopter can reach you out there  and no plane can land. We are forging ahead of a huge storm. Within it  there was    knots of wind  which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with. The waves were already    to    feet high  and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard. If we didn't sail fast enough  we'd be engulfed by that storm  and either capsized or smashed to pieces. We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge. The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger. We all know what it's like driving a car    miles an hour        . It's not too stressful. We can concentrate. We can turn on the radio. Take that             accelerate through to             miles an hour. Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel. Now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers  the windscreen  the headlights and the brakes. That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean. You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation  even as a passenger. But you're not a passenger. You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in  and you have to make every single decision on board. I was absolutely exhausted  physically and mentally. Eight sail changes in    hours. The mainsail weighed three times my body weight  and after each change  I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat. But out there  those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs. A few days later  we came out of the back of the low. Against all odds  we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression. The sky cleared  the rain stopped  and our heartbeat  the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains. It's hard to explain  but you enter a different mode when you head out there. Your boat is your entire world  and what you take with you when you leave is all you have. If I said to you all now   Go off into Vancouver and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months   that's quite a task. That's food  fuel  clothes  even toilet roll and toothpaste. That's what we do  and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food. No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word  finite.  What we have out there is all we have. There is no more. And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record. Suddenly I connected the dots. Our global economy is no different. It's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity. And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices  I either put that stone to one side and learn more about it  or I put that stone back and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world. I chose the first. I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning  speaking to chief executives  experts  scientists  economists to try to understand just how our global economy works. And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places. This photo was taken in the burner of a coal fired power station. I was fascinated by coal  fundamental to our global energy needs  but also very close to my family. My great grandfather was a coal miner  and he spent    years of his life underground. This is a photo of him  and when you see that photo  you see someone from another era. No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age.  Laughter  But yet  that's me with my great grandfather  and by the way  they are not his real ears.  Laughter  We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories. He talked of the camaraderie underground  and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they worked with underground. It was like it was yesterday. And on my journey of learning  I went to the World Coal Association website  and there in the middle of the homepage  it said   We have about     years of coal left.  And I thought to myself  well  that's well outside my lifetime  and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil. But I did the math  and I realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly     years before that year  and I sat on his knee until I was    years old  and I realized it's nothing in time  nor in history. And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make  to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across  the future of our global economy. And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy. It was also materials. In       I picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have of valuable materials to extract from the ground  copper      tin  zinc      silver    . These figures couldn't be exact  but we knew those materials were finite. We only have them once. And yet  our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly  exponentially. With more people in the world with more stuff  we've effectively seen     years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just    years. And this affects all of us. It's brought huge volatility in prices  so much so that in       your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of     million Euros  wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over. And the more I learned  the more I started to change my own life. I started traveling less  doing less  using less. It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do. But it sat uneasy with me. It didn't feel right. It felt like we were buying ourselves time. We were eking things out a bit longer. Even if everybody changed  it wouldn't solve the problem. It wouldn't fix the system. It was vital in the transition  but what fascinated me was  in the transition to what  What could actually work  It struck me that the system itself  the framework within which we live  is fundamentally flawed  and I realized ultimately that our operating system  the way our economy functions  the way our economy's been built  is a system in itself. At sea  I had to understand complex systems. I had to take multiple inputs  I had to process them  and I had to understand the system to win. I had to make sense of it. And as I looked at our global economy  I realized it too is that system  but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term. And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy for     years  where we take a material out of the ground  we make something out of it  and then ultimately that product gets thrown away  and yes  we do recycle some of it  but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end  not by design. It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term  and if we know that we have finite materials  why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up  that would create waste  Life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively. It's a complex system  but within it  there is no waste. Everything is metabolized. It's not a linear economy at all  but circular. And I felt like the child in the garden. For the first time on this new journey  I could see exactly where we were headed. If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up  we could build a future that really could work in the long term. I was excited. This was something to work towards. We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there  and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September     . Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model  industrial symbiosis  performance economy  sharing economy  biomimicry  and of course  cradle to cradle design. Materials would be defined as either technical or biological  waste would be designed out entirely  and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term. So what could this economy look like  Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings  but we'd pay for the service of light  and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products. What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it  It would never become waste. What if engines were re manufacturable  and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand. What if we could recover components from circuit boards  reutilize them  and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage  What if we could collect food waste  human waste  What if we could turn that into fertilizer  heat  energy  ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital  And cars    what we want is to move around. We don't need to own the materials within them. Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future  All of this sounds amazing  but these aren't just ideas  they're real today  and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy. What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up. So how would you shift from linear to circular  Well  the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work with the top universities in the world  with leading businesses within the world  with the biggest convening platforms in the world  and with governments. We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question   Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints  Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital  Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use   Yes was the answer to the decoupling  but also yes  we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering  .  times. But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people. When young people see the economy through a circular lens  they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon. They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system  and it's there for the taking right now  and the faster we do this  the better. So could we achieve this in their lifetimes  Is it actually possible  I believe yes. When you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather  anything's possible. When he was born  there were only    cars in the world  they had only just been invented. When he was     we flew for the first time in history. Now there are         charter flights every single day. When he was     we built the first computer. Many said it wouldn't catch on  but it did  and just    years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands in this room here today. Ten years before he died  we built the first mobile phone. It wasn't that mobile  to be fair  but now it really is  and as my great grandfather left this Earth  the Internet arrived. Now we can do anything  but more importantly  now we have a plan. Thank you. As a matter of fact  I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House  and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up at his father  and he says   Daddy  when I grow up  I want to be a former president.  Well  I have had a great blessing as a former president  because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe. Not only am I familiar with the    states in the United States  but also my wife and I have visited more than     countries in the world  and the Carter Center has had full time programs in    nations on Earth. And a lot of times  when we go into a country  we not only the meet the king or the president  but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights  and knowing the world as I do  I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is  strangely  not addressed quite often  is the abuse of women and girls. There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures  holy scriptures  in the Bible  Old Testament  New Testament  Quran and so forth  and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques. And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago  in the year       I had been a Baptist  a Southern Baptist for    years    I tell you  I still teach Sunday school every Sunday  I'll be teaching this Sunday as well    but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year      decided that women should play a secondary position  a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict  in effect  that prevents women from being priests  pastors  deacons in the church  or chaplains in the military  and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary  they cannot teach if a boy is in the room  because you can find verses in the Bible  there's over        verses in the Bible  that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man  and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all pervasive problem  because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer  for instance  wants to cheat women  they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God  why should I treat them as equals myself  Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work  The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence  and that is increasing tremendously around the world. In the United States of America  for instance  we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people  mostly black people and minorities  by putting them in prison. When I was in office as governor of Georgia  one out of every       Americans were in prison. Nowadays   .  people per       are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House  there's been an     percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have  one of the only countries  on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country. And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now  and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting    people for the death penalty. If you add that up  that's     million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty  because it costs so much.  Applause  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most  and I'll be fairly brief  because I have a limited amount of time  as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women  but in some countries  many countries  when a child is born that's a girl  very soon in her life  her genitals are completely cut away by a so called cutter who has a razor blade and  in a non sterilized way  they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia. And sometimes  in more extreme cases but not very rare cases  they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate. And then later  when she gets married  the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex. This is not a rare thing  although it's against the law in most countries. In Egypt  for instance     percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries  it's more than    percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing is honor killings  where a family with misinterpretation  again  of a holy scripture    there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this    will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man that her father does not approve  or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members of her own family  so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that    percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father  the uncle or the brother  but    percent of the murders are conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery  or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about   .  million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the   th century and the   th century. There are    million people now living in slavery. The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year  and the State Department reports that         people are sold across international borders every year into slavery  and that    percent of those sold are women  into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment         people are living in human bondage  or slavery. Atlanta  Georgia  where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University  they have between     and     women  people sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place in the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world  and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin  they can do it for       dollars. A white skinned girl brings several times more than that  and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about         per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta  Georgia  exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta  Georgia. So this is another very serious problem  and the basic problem is prostitution  because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials  the local policemen  or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one of the worst problems  and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About    to    years ago  Sweden decided to change the law  and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery  but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted  and     Applause     prostitution has gone down. In the United States  we take just the opposite position. For every male arrested for illegal sex trade     women are arrested in the United States of America. Canada  Ireland  I've already said Sweden  France  and other countries are moving now towards this so called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire  our military and our great university system. In the military  they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got  there were        sexual assaults that took place in the military          . Only        not much more than   percent  are actually prosecuted  and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization    a ship like my submarine  or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines    the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not  and of course  the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command  sexual assaults are taking place  so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates  and this is now getting a lot of publicity  partially because of my book  but other things  and so    universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists  because outside of the university system  if they rape somebody  they'll be prosecuted  but when they get on a university campus  they can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work  as you know.  Applause  And this is sometimes misinterpreted  but for full time employment  a woman in the United States now gets    percent less than a man. When I became president  the difference was    percent. So we've made some progress  partially because I was president and so forth     Applause   Laughter     but in the last    years  there's been no progress made  so it's been just about    or    percent difference for the last    years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune     companies     of them have women CEOs  out of      and those CEOs  I need not tell you  make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well  that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth. We have been to war with about    different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes  we've had soldiers on the ground fighting. The other times  we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times  of course  now  we have drones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war with    different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years  I won't say which ones  where we didn't    we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway  those kinds of things  the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes  are the basic causes  of abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause that I need not mention  and that is that in general  men don't give a damn. The average man that might say  I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy  and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child  when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination  legally  had existed for     years  from      at the end of the War Between the States  the Civil War  all the way up to the     s  when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time  there were many white people that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay  but they stayed quiet  because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs  unique access to jury duty  better schools  and everything else  and that's the same thing that exists today  because the average man really doesn't care. Even though they say   I'm against discrimination against girls and women   they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system  the majority of men that control the military system  the majority of men that control the governments of the world  and the majority of men that control the great religions. So what is the basic thing that we need to do today  I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one  and where you come from  Europe and so forth  who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act  need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down to detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference  that every woman here  will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market  need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters. I have    grandchildren  four children  and    great grandchildren  and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America  not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country  in having equal rights  and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much. A few years ago  my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis. Her wrists  knees and toes swelled up  causing crippling  chronic pain. She had to file for disability. She stopped attending our local mosque. Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth. I wanted to help. But I didn't know how. I'm not a doctor. So  what I am is a historian of medicine. So I started to research the history of chronic pain. Turns out  UCLA has an entire history of pain collection in their archives. And I found a story    a fantastic story    of a man who saved    rescued    millions of people from pain  people like my mom. Yet  I had never heard of him. There were no biographies of him  no Hollywood movies. His name was John J. Bonica. But when our story begins  he was better known as Johnny  Bull  Walker. It was a summer day in     . The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield  New York. Spectators flocked to see the wire walkers  the tramp clowns    if they were lucky  the human cannonball. They also came to see the strongman  Johnny  Bull  Walker  a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar. You know  on that particular day  a voice rang out over the circus P.A. system. They needed a doctor urgently  in the live animal tent. Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer. The climax of his act had gone wrong  and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth. He was running out of air  the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out. When the lion finally did relax its jaws  the lion tamer just slumped to the ground  motionless. When he came to a few minutes later  he saw a familiar figure hunched over him. It was Bull Walker. The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth to mouth  and saved his life. Now  the strongman hadn't told anyone  but he was actually a third year medical student. He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition  but kept it a secret to protect his persona. He was supposed to be a brute  a villain    not a nerdy do gooder. His medical colleagues didn't know his secret  either. As he put it   If you were an athlete  you were a dumb dodo.  So he didn't tell them about the circus  or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends. He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker  or later  the Masked Marvel. He even kept it a secret that same year  when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world. Over the years  John J. Bonica lived these parallel lives. He was a wrestler  he was a doctor. He was a heel  he was a hero. He inflicted pain  and he treated it. And he didn t know it at the time  but over the next five decades  he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain. It'd change modern medicine so much so  that decades later  Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father. But that all happened later. In       Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma  his sweetheart  whom he had met at one of his matches years before. He still wrestled in secret    he had to. His internship at New York's St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing. With his championship belt  he wrestled in big ticket venues  like Madison Square Garden  against big time opponents  like Everett  The Blonde Bear  Marshall  or three time world champion  Angelo Savoldi. The matches took a toll on his body  he tore hip joints  fractured ribs. One night  The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face. The next morning at work  he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it. Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R. with one eye so bruised  he couldn't see out of it. But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears. He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head. Pain just kept accumulating in his life. Next  he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital. She heaved and pushed  clearly in anguish. Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain. But the intern was a young guy  just three weeks on the job    he was jittery  and in applying the ether  irritated Emma's throat. She vomited and choked  and started to turn blue. Bonica  who was watching all this  pushed the intern out of the way  cleared her airway  and saved his wife and his unborn daughter. At that moment  he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology. Later  he'd even go on to help develop the epidural  for delivering mothers. But before he could focus on obstetrics  Bonica had to report for basic training. Right around D Day  Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center  near Tacoma. At       beds  it was one of the largest army hospitals in America. Bonica was in charge of all pain control there. He was only   . Treating so many patients  Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned. Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell    in a good way    a body's way of signaling an injury  like a broken arm. But in some cases  like after a patient had a leg amputated  that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg. But if the injury had been treated  why would the alarm bell keep ringing  There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever  and yet  still the patient hurt. Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital    surgeons  neurologists  psychiatrists  others. And he tried to get their opinions on his patients. It took too long  so he started organizing group meetings over lunch. It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain. No one had ever focused on pain this way before. After that  he hit the books. He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on  carefully noting every mention of the word  pain.  Out of the        pages he read  the word  pain  was on    and a half of them. Seventeen and a half. For the most basic  most common  most frustrating part of being a patient. Bonica was shocked    I'm quoting him  he said   What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there  The most important thing from the patient's perspective  they don't talk about.  So over the next eight years  Bonica would talk about it. He'd write about it  he'd write those missing pages. He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain. In it he proposed new strategies  new treatments using nerve block injections. He proposed a new institution  the Pain Clinic  based on those lunchtime meetings. But the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine. A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives. He recast the very purpose of medicine. The goal wasn't to make patients better  it was to make patients feel better. He pushed his pain agenda for decades  before it finally took hold in the mid '  s. Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world. But as they did    a tragic twist. Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him. He had been out of the ring for over    years  but those       professional bouts had left a mark on his body. Still in his mid   s  he suffered severe osteoarthritis. Over the next    years he'd have    surgeries  including four spine operations  and hip replacement after hip replacement. He could barely raise his arm  turn his neck. He needed aluminum crutches to walk. His friends and former students became his doctors. One recalled that he probably had more nerve block injections than anyone else on the planet. Already a workaholic  he worked even more        to    hour days. Healing others became more than just his job  it was his own most effective form of relief.  If I wasn't as busy as I am   he told a reporter at the time   I would be a completely disabled guy.  On a business trip to Florida in the early     s  Bonica got a former student to drive him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa. They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion  with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage. The house belonged to the Zacchini family  who were something like American circus royalty. Decades earlier  Bonica had watched them  clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles  doing the act they pioneered    the Human Cannonball. But now they were like him  retired. That generation is all dead now  including Bonica  so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day. But still  I love imagining it. The strongman and the human cannonballs reunited  showing off old scars  and new ones. Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice. Maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history  which is that his time in the circus and wrestling deeply molded his life. Bonica saw pain close up. He felt it. He lived it. And it made it impossible for him to ignore in others. Out of that empathy  he spun a whole new field  played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself. In that same oral history  Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience. That it involves your past life  your current life  your interactions  your family. That was definitely true for Bonica. But it was also true for my mom. It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient  a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms. Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way. But as I saw Bonica's pain    a testament to his fully lived life    I started to remember all the things that my mom's pain holds. Before they got swollen and arthritic  my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H.R. department where she worked. They folded samosas for our entire mosque. When I was a kid  they cut my hair  wiped my nose  tied my shoes. Thank you. Every group of female friends has the funny one  the one you go to when you need a good cry  the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day. And this group was no different. Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women who came together    first to become teammates  then friends  and then family    in the least likely of places  on the Special Operations battlefield. This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear  but by the fact that they were there at a time when women    officially  at least    remained banned from ground combat  and America had no idea they existed. This story begins with Special Operations leaders  some of the most tested men in the United States military  saying   We need women to help us wage this war.   America would never kill its way to the end of its wars   it argued.  Needed more knowledge and more understanding.  And as everyone knows  if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home  you talk to women  whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan  or Southern California. But in this case  men could not talk to women  because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan  that would cause grave offense. So you needed women soldiers out there. That meant  at this time in the war  that the women who would be recruited to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs  would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent of the entire United States military. Less than five percent. So the call went out.  Female soldiers  Become a part of history. Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan.  This is in     . And from Alabama to Alaska  a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best  and to make a difference for their country  answered that call to serve. And for them it was not about politics  it was about serving with purpose. And so  the women who came to North Carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women on the Special Operations front lines  landed and found very quickly a community  the likes of which they had never seen. Full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were  and as driven to make a difference. They didn't have to apologize for who they were  and in fact  they could celebrate it. And what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden  there were lots of people like them. As one of them said   It was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo.  Among this team of standouts was Cassie  a young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet  a sorority sister and a Women's Studies minor  all in one person. Tristan  a West Point track star  who always ran and road marched with no socks  and had shoes whose smell proved it. Amber  a Heidi look alike  who had always wanted to be in the infantry  and when she found out that women couldn't be  she decided to become an intel officer. She served in Bosnia  and later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania. And then there was Kate  who played high school football all four years  and actually wanted to drop out after the first  to go into the glee club  but when boys told her that girls couldn't play football  she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her. For them  biology had shaped part of their destiny  and put  as Cassie once said   everything noble out of reach for girls.  And yet  here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to their country  not despite the fact that they were female  but because of it. This team of women  in many ways  was like women everywhere. They wore makeup  and in fact  they would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil. They also wore body armor. They would put    pounds of weight on their backs  and board the helicopter for an operation  and they would come back and watch a movie called  Bridesmaids.  They even wore a thing called Spanx  because  as they found very quickly  the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small  and small where they should be big. So Lane  an Iraq War veteran    you see her here on my left    decided she was going to go on Amazon and order a pair of Spanx to her base  so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night. These women would get together over video conference from all around Afghanistan from their various bases  and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing. They would swap jokes  they would talk about what was working  what wasn't  what they had learned to do well  what they needed to do better. And they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women out on the Special Operations front lines  including the Shewee  which was a tool that let you pee like a guy  although it's said to have had only a    percent accuracy rate out there. These women lived in the  and.  They proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine. You could wear mascara and body armor. You could love CrossFit  and really like cross stitch. You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies. Women live in the and every single day  and these women brought that to this mission as well. On this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines  but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there. There was the night Amber went out on mission  and in talking to the women of the house  realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait for the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home. Another night it was Tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing  and that in fact  explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night. There was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs  when she found the intel item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper. And there was the night that Isabel  another one of their teammates  found the things that they were looking for  and received an Impact Award from the Rangers who said that without her  the things and the people they were looking for that night would never have been found. That night and so many others  they went out to prove themselves  not only for one another  but for everybody who would come after them. And also for the men alongside whom they served. We talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman. And in this case  next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed. The Army Ranger who trained them had served    deployments. And when they told him that he had to go train girls  he had no idea what to expect. But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of       he told his fellow Ranger   We have just witnessed history. These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen.  At the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called  the best of us.  She was a petite blonde dynamo  who barely reached five foot three. And she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart  and what we know as G.I. Jane. She was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband  her Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best  and to trust herself  and to test every limit she could. She also loved to put    pounds of weight on her back and run for miles  and she loved to be a soldier. She was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar  and would bake a batch of raisin bread  and then go to the gym and bust out    or    pull ups from a dead hang. She was the person who  if you needed an extra pair of boots or a home cooked dinner  would be on your speed dial. Because she never  ever would talk to you about how good she was  but let her character speak through action. She was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong. And she was also famous for walking up to a    foot rope  climbing it using only her arms  and then shuffling away and apologizing  because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs  as the Rangers had trained them. Some of our heroes return home to tell their stories. And some of them don't. And on October           First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers  Christopher Horns and Kristoffer Domeij. Her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight. Because after all  the ban on women in combat was still very much in place. And at her funeral  the head of Army Special Operations came  and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of Ashley White  but to all her team of sisters.  Make no mistake about it   he said   these women are warriors  and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the United States Army.  Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver  who bakes cookies on the side. She doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days  in which grief    enormous grief    mixed with pride. But she does remember one moment. A stranger with a child in her hand came up to her and she said   Mrs. White  I brought my daughter here today  because I wanted her to know what a hero was. And I wanted her to know that heroes could be women  too.  It is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines who reach into their guts and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit. This very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward did indeed become part of history  and they paved the way for so many who would come after them  as much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before. These women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes. And women can be heroes  too. Thank you so much. My colleagues and I are fascinated by the science of moving dots. So what are these dots  Well  it's all of us. And we're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world. And wouldn't it be great if we could understand all this movement  If we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it. And luckily for us  we live in a time where we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves. So whether it's through sensors or videos  or apps  we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail. So it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement is sports. So whether it's basketball or baseball  or football or the other football  we're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second. So what we're doing is turning our athletes into    you probably guessed it    moving dots. So we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data  it's hard to deal with and not that interesting. But there are things that  for example  basketball coaches want to know. And the problem is they can't know them because they'd have to watch every second of every game  remember it and process it. And a person can't do that  but a machine can. The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach. At least they couldn't until now. So what have we taught the machine to see  So  we started simply. We taught it things like passes  shots and rebounds. Things that most casual fans would know. And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated. Events like post ups  and pick and rolls  and isolations. And if you don't know them  that's okay. Most casual players probably do. Now  we've gotten to a point where today  the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins. Basically things only professionals know. So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach. So how have we been able to do this  If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll  they would give me a description  and if I encoded that as an algorithm  it would be terrible. The pick and roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players  two on offense and two on defense. And here's kind of how it goes. So there's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball  and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens  and ta da  it's a pick and roll. So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm. So  if the player who's the interferer    he's called the screener    goes close by  but he doesn't stop  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or if he does stop  but he doesn't stop close enough  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or  if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket  it's probably not a pick and roll. Or I could be wrong  they could all be pick and rolls. It really depends on the exact timing  the distances  the locations  and that's what makes it hard. So  luckily  with machine learning  we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know. So how does this work  Well  it's by example. So we go to the machine and say   Good morning  machine. Here are some pick and rolls  and here are some things that are not. Please find a way to tell the difference.  And the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate. So if I was going to teach it the difference between an apple and orange  I might say   Why don't you use color or shape   And the problem that we're solving is  what are those things  What are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots  So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location  distance  timing  velocities    that's really the key to the science of moving dots  or as we like to call it  spatiotemporal pattern recognition  in academic vernacular. Because the first thing is  you have to make it sound hard    because it is. The key thing is  for NBA coaches  it's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not. It's that they want to know how it happened. And why is it so important to them  So here's a little insight. It turns out in modern basketball  this pick and roll is perhaps the most important play. And knowing how to run it  and knowing how to defend it  is basically a key to winning and losing most games. So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters  and that's why we need this to be really  really good. So  here's an example. There are two offensive and two defensive players  getting ready to do the pick and roll dance. So the guy with ball can either take  or he can reject. His teammate can either roll or pop. The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under. His teammate can either show or play up to touch  or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and I didn't know most of these things when I started and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows. It would make our lives a lot easier  but it turns out movement is very messy. People wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy  both in precision and recall  is tough because that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you. And despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that. Coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations. We're at the point where almost every single contender for an NBA championship this year is using our software  which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball. So not only that  we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams win very important games  and it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league for    years that are willing to take advice from a machine. And it's very exciting  it's much more than the pick and roll. Our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things. Frankly  I don't understand much of what it does  and while it's not that special to be smarter than me  we were wondering  can a machine know more than a coach  Can it know more than person could know  And it turns out the answer is yes. The coaches want players to take good shots. So if I'm standing near the basket and there's nobody near me  it's a good shot. If I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders  that's generally a bad shot. But we never knew how good  good  was  or how bad  bad  was quantitatively. Until now. So what we can do  again  using spatiotemporal features  we looked at every shot. We can see  Where is the shot  What's the angle to the basket  Where are the defenders standing  What are their distances  What are their angles  For multiple defenders  we can look at how the player's moving and predict the shot type. We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances  So why is this important  We can take something that was shooting  which was one thing before  and turn it into two things  the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter. So here's a bubble chart  because what's TED without a bubble chart  Those are NBA players. The size is the size of the player and the color is the position. On the x axis  we have the shot probability. People on the left take difficult shots  on the right  they take easy shots. On the  y axis  is their shooting ability. People who are good are at the top  bad at the bottom. So for example  if there was a player who generally made    percent of their shots  that's all you knew before. But today  I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player would make    percent of the time  and they are two percent worse. And the reason that's important is that there are lots of   s out there. And so it's really important to know if the    that you're considering giving     million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots. Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players  it changes how we look at the game. So there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago  in the NBA finals. Miami was down by three  there was    seconds left. They were about to lose the championship. A gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie. He missed. His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound  passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen. He sank a three. It went into overtime. They won the game. They won the championship. It was one of the most exciting games in basketball. And our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second  and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before. Now unfortunately  I can't show you that video. But for you  we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about   weeks ago. And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights. So  here is us. This is Chinatown in Los Angeles  a park we play at every week  and that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment and all the tracking that's associated with it. So  here's the shot. I'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment. The only difference is  instead of the professional players  it's us  and instead of a professional announcer  it's me. So  bear with me. Miami. Down three. Twenty seconds left. Jeff brings up the ball. Josh catches  puts up a three   Calculating shot probability   Shot quality   Rebound probability  Won't go   Rebound probability  Rebound  Noel. Back to Daria.  Shot quality  Her three pointer    bang  Tie game with five seconds left. The crowd goes wild. That's roughly how it happened. Roughly. That moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA and we know that and a great many other things. I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen. Okay  I will  It was four. Way to go  Daria. But the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game    it's not that. It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement. You do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement. In fact  it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere. We're moving in our homes  in our offices  as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world. What will we know  What will we learn  Perhaps  instead of identifying pick and rolls  a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps. Which could literally be happening any second now. Perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings  better plan our cities. I believe that with the development of the science of moving dots  we will move better  we will move smarter  we will move forward. Thank you very much. I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi  Eileen Piri. Eileen is only    years old  but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote  I found her poem so interesting  so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem  I'll Marry When I Want.   I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle  my aunt  my brother or sister  cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me  even if you chase me away  even if you do anything bad to me  I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want  but not before I am well educated  and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want.  This poem might seem odd  written by a    year old girl  but where I and Eileen come from  this poem  which I have just read to you  is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries  very poor  where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country  I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls  two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes  they would share clothes  and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently  in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only    years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her  even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture  once you reach puberty stage  you are supposed to go to initiation camps. In these initiation camps  you are taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day  which they call  Very Special Day  where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister  she ended up being pregnant. Today  she's only    years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive  nor did her second marriage. On the other side  there is this girl. She's amazing. I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me.  Laughter  When I was    years old  I was told  you are grown up  you have now reached of age  you're supposed to go to the initiation camp. I was like   What  I'm not going to go to the initiation camps.  You know what the women said to me   You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions of our society  of our community.  I said no because I knew where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated  to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer  seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day  I would contribute something  a little something to my community. But every day after refusing  women would tell me   Look at you  you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. What about you   That was the music that I was hearing every day  and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories between me and my sister  I said   Why can't I do something  Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community   That was when I called other girls just like my sister  who have children  who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write. I said   Come on  we can  remind each other how to read and write again  how to hold the pen  how to read  to hold the book.  It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them  but they were able to tell me their personal stories  what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like  'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers  our traditional leaders  that these are the wrong things   It was a scary thing to do  because these traditional leaders  they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change  but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard  but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community  it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader  and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be married before the age of   . In my community  that was the first time a community  they had to call the bylaws  the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community  but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill was being presented in February  we were there at the Parliament house. Every day  when the members of Parliament were entering  we were telling them   Would you please support the bill   And we don't have much technology like here  but we have our small phones. So we said   Why can't we get  their numbers and text them   So we did that. It was a good thing. So when the bill passed  we texted them back   Thank you for supporting the bill.  And when the bill was signed by the president  making it into law  it was a plus. Now  in Malawi     is the legal marriage age  from    to   . It's a good thing to know that the bill passed  but let me tell you this  There are countries where    is the legal marriage age  but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day  Every day  girls' lives are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment  it means keeping girls' issues at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second  but they have to know that women  as we are in this room  we are not just women  we are not just girls  we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi  and not just Malawi but other countries  The laws which are there  you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced  The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there  they need to be publicized at the local level  at the community level  where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues  difficult issues  at the community level every day. So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them  they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful  they are there  but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates  they have to jump in  to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need  good education  and above all  not to marry whilst   . And furthermore  I know that together  we can transform the legal  the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl  and millions of girls worldwide  will be able to say   I will marry when I want.  Thank you.  Applause  This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding  and when I was there  there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  Not the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen   as this was not a Disney sanctioned event. These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties. Your kid is turning five  They'll come sing some songs  sprinkle some fairy dust  it's great. And they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was  Frozen.  So they get hired by a local toy store  kids come in on a Saturday morning  buy some Disney swag  get their picture taken with the princesses  call it a day. It's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions. And my three and a half year old niece Samantha was in the thick of it. She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits. According to my niece and the     plus kids in the parking lot that day  this was the Anna and Elsa from  Frozen.  It is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio. We get there at    o'clock  the scheduled start time  and we are handed number   . By    o'clock they had called numbers    through     this was going to be a while  and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store. So  by       we get called      to     please.  And as we walk in  it is a scene I can only describe you as saying it looked like Norway threw up. There were cardboard cut out snowflakes covering the floor  glitter on every flat surface  and icicles all over the walls. And as we stood in line in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point than the backside of the mother of number     I put her up on my shoulders  and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses. And as we moved forward  her excitement only grew  and as we finally got to the front of the line  and number    unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses  I could literally feel the excitement running through her body. And let's be honest  at that point  I was pretty excited too. I mean  the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing. So we get to the front of the line  and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says   Hi  honey. You're next  Do you want to get down  or you're going to stay on your dad's shoulders for the picture ' And I was  for a lack of a better word  frozen. It's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question  who am I  Am I an aunt  Or am I an advocate  Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation  and there one was  right in front of me. At the same time  there's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life  so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in  torn between two things  two impossible choices. Would I be an advocate  Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that I was in fact her aunt  not her father  and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides    and while doing that  miss out on what was  to this point  the greatest moment of my niece's life. Or would I be an aunt  Would I brush off that comment  take a million pictures  and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment  and by doing that  walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself  especially in front of my niece. Who was I  Which one was more important  Which role was more worth it  Was I an aunt  Or was I an advocate  And I had a split second to decide. We are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity. It's so black and white  so us and them  so right and wrong. There is no middle  there is no gray  just polarity. Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other  a diametrical opposition. Which side are you on  Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar  pro choice  anti death penalty  pro gun regulation  proponent of open borders and pro union  Or  are you absolutely  and uncompromisingly pro war  pro life  pro death penalty  a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute  anti immigrant and pro business  It's all or none  you're with us or against us. That is polarity. The problem with polarity  and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature. But if we are pulled in these two directions  but it's not really where we exist    polarity is not our actual reality    where do we go from there  What's at the other end of that spectrum  I don't think it's an unattainable  harmonious utopia  I think the opposite of polarity is duality. Duality is a state of having two parts  but not in diametrical opposition  in simultaneous existence. Don't think it's possible  Here are the people I know  I know Catholics who are pro choice  and feminists who wear hijabs  and veterans who are antiwar  and NRA members who think I should be able to get married. Those are the people I know  those are my friends and family  that is the majority of our society  that is you  that is me. Duality is the ability to hold both things. But the question is  Can we own our duality  Can we have the courage to hold both things  I work at a restaurant in town  I became really good friends with the busser. I was a server and we had  a great relationship  we had a really great time together. Her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico. That line actually went the other way. Her English was limited  but significantly better than my Spanish. But we were united by our similarities  not separated by our differences. And we were close  even though we came from very different worlds. She was from Mexico  she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home. She was a devout conservative Catholic  a believer in traditional family values  stereotypical roles of men and women  and I was  well  me. But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend  or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home. Those were the things that brought us together. So one day  we were in the back  scarfing down food as quickly as we could  gathered around a small table  during a very rare lull  and a new guy from the kitchen came over    who happened to be her cousin    and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his    year old body could hold. And he said to her   in Spanish   Does Ash have a boyfriend   And she said   in Spanish   No  she has a girlfriend.  And he said   in Spanish   A girlfriend     And she set down her fork  and locked eyes with him  and said   in Spanish   Yes  a girlfriend. That is all.  And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect  grabbed his plate  walked off  went back to work. She never made eye contact with me. She left  did the same thing    it was a    second conversation  such a short interaction. And on paper  she had so much more in common with him  language  culture  history  family  her community was her lifeline here  but her moral compass trumped all of that. And a little bit later  they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish  that had nothing to do with me  and that is duality. She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage. She didn't have to choose her family over our friendship. It wasn't Jesus or Ash. Her individual morality was so strongly rooted that she had the courage to hold both things. Our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient. That's what it means to be an ally  and if you're going to be an ally  you have to be an active ally  Ask questions  act when you hear something inappropriate  actually engage. I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover. Really  Lover  So overly sexual  so '  s gay porn. But she was trying  and she asked. She could have called her my friend  or my  friend   or my  special friend     or even worse  just not asked at all. Believe me  we would rather have you ask. I would rather have her say lover  than say nothing at all. People often say to me   Well  Ash  I don't care. I don't see race or religion or sexuality. It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it.  But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love  it's apathy. If you don't see my gayness  then you don't see me. If it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with  then you cannot imagine what it feels like when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand  and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter. And the small victory I feel when I make it by and don't have to let go. And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it. If you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because I am gay  then you don't see me. If you are going to be an ally  I need you to see me. As individuals  as allies  as humans  we need to be able to hold both things  both the good and the bad  the easy and the hard. You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff  you learn it from the grit. And what if duality is just the first step  What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction we are able to learn to hold two things  And if we can hold two things  we can hold four  and if we can hold four  we can hold eight  and if we can hold eight  we can hold hundreds. We are complex individuals  swirls of contradiction. You are all holding so many things right now. What can you do to hold just a few more  So  back to Toledo  Ohio. I'm at the front of the line  niece on my shoulders  the frazzled clerk calls me Dad. Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender  Not even that. Have you ever been called something you are not  Here's what it feels like for me  I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions. I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation  I feel like the entire store is staring at me  and I simultaneously feel invisible. I want to explode in a tirade of fury  and I want to crawl under a rock. And top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing an out of character tight fitting purple t shirt  so this whole store can see my boobs  to make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen. But  despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am  it still happens. And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard    not my sister  not my girlfriend  and certainly not my niece. I am accustomed to this familiar hurt  but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it. But then I take my niece off my shoulders  and she runs to Elsa and Anna    the thing she's been waiting so long for    and all that stuff goes away. All that matters is the smile on her face. And as the    seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close we gather up our things  and I lock eyes with the clerk again  and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths   I am so sorry   And her humanity  her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately  then I give her a   It's okay  it happens. But thanks.  And I realize in that moment that I don't have to be either an aunt or an advocate  I can be both. I can live in duality  and I can hold two things. And if I can hold two things in that environment  I can hold so many more things. As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door  I turn to my sister and say   Was it worth it   And she said   Are you kidding me  Did you see the look on her face  This was the greatest day of her life    It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat  it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of.   It was even worth you  getting called Dad.  And for the first time ever in my life  it actually was. Thank you  Boulder. Have a good night. About    years ago  I went through a little bit of a hard time. So I decided to go see a therapist. I had been seeing her for a few months  when she looked at me one day and said   Who actually raised you until you were three   Seemed like a weird question. I said   My parents.  And she said   I don't think that's actually the case  because if it were  we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this.  It sounded like the setup to a joke  but I knew she was serious. Because when I first started seeing her  I was trying to be the funniest person in the room. And I would try and crack these jokes  but she caught on to me really quickly  and whenever I tried to make a joke  she would look at me and say   That is actually really sad.  It's terrible. So I knew I had to be serious  and I asked my parents who had actually raised me until I was three  And to my surprise  they said my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family. I had called her my auntie. I remember my auntie so clearly  it felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older. I remember the thick  straight hair  and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up  her soft  southern Thai accent  the way I would cling to her  even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat. I loved her  but  with  the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love also requires letting go. But my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie  is also one of my first memories of life at all. I remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family. I remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop  as I did every single time it happened  for things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends  or being a little late. I became so hysterical over her treatment  that eventually  she was just beaten behind closed doors. Things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away. As an adult  I learned later that she had been just    when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me  on a tourist visa. She wound up working in Illinois for a time  before eventually returning to Thailand  which is where I ran into her again  at a political rally in Bangkok. I clung to her again  as I had when I was a child  and I let go  and then I promised that I would call. I never did  though. Because I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me    that I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care  and that the words  I'm sorry  were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had    I thought if I said those words to her  I would never stop crying again. Because she had saved me. And I had not saved her. I'm a journalist  and I've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so  and even so  I never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty recently. I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking. Because human trafficking is far more prevalent  complex and close to home than most of us realize. I spent time in jails and brothels  interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement  NGO workers. And when I think about what we've done about human trafficking  I am hugely disappointed. Partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all. When I say  human trafficking   most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie. You probably think about a young girl or woman  who's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp. That is real suffering  and that is a real story. That story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation  though. As a journalist  I really care about how we relate to each other through language  and the way we tell that story  with all the gory  violent detail  the salacious aspects    I call that  look at her scars  journalism. We use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl. That story lets us off the hook. It takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for  for the structural inequality  or the poverty  or the barriers to migration. We let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution  when in reality  human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives. Let me show you what I mean. Forced prostitution accounts for    percent of human trafficking. Ten percent is in state  imposed forced labor. but a whopping    percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day  in sectors like agricultural work  domestic work and construction. That is food and care and shelter. And somehow  these most essential workers are also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today. Human trafficking is the use of force  fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor. And it's found in cotton fields  and coltan mines  and even car washes in Norway and England. It's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's found in Thailand's fishing industry. That country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world. But what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp  Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats. Those fishing boats were taken out  the men put to work  and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick  or trying to resist their treatment. Those fish were then used to feed shrimp  The shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers  Costco  Tesco  Walmart and Carrefour. Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that  and in places you would never even imagine. Traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks  or to sing in touring boys' choirs. Trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey. The scheme in that case was incredible. The traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo  and they told these families that  your daughters are going to get a fine education in the United States.  They then located winners of the green card lottery  and they told them   We'll help you out. We'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees. All you have to do is take this young girl with you  say that she's your sister or your spouse. Once everyone arrived in New Jersey  the young girls were taken away  and put to work for    hour days  seven days a week  for five years. They made their traffickers nearly four million dollars. This is a huge problem. So what have we done about it  We've mostly turned to the criminal justice system. But keep in mind  most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized. They're migrants  people of color. Sometimes they're in the sex trade. And for populations like these  the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem  rather than the solution. In study after study  in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States  between    and    percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone. People in prostitution  including people who have been trafficked into it  regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution. Having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty  leave abuse  or leave prostitution  if that person so desires. Workers outside of the sex sector    if they try and resist their treatment  they risk deportation. In case after case I've studied  employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked workers. If those workers run away  they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught. Law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers. But out of an estimated    million victims of human trafficking in the world  they have helped and identified fewer than        people. That's like comparing the population of the world to the population of Los Angeles  proportionally speaking. As for convictions  out of an estimated       convictions in       fewer than     were for labor trafficking. Keep in mind that labor trafficking accounts for    percent of all trafficking  but fewer than    percent of the convictions. I've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed. I'd like to add one more element to that. Trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections  and denied the right to organize. Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens in systematically degraded work environments. You might be thinking  oh  she's talking about failed states  or war torn states  or    I'm actually talking about the United States. Let me tell you what that looks like. I spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons  involving hundreds of Thai farm workers. They were sent all over the States  to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations  and Washington apple orchards  and anywhere the work was needed. They were promised three years of solid agricultural work. So they made a calculated risk. They sold their land  they sold their wives' jewelry  to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company  Global Horizons. But once they were brought over  their passports were confiscated. Some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint. They worked so hard they fainted in the fields. This case hit me so hard. After I came back home  I was wandering through the grocery store  and I froze in the produce department. I was remembering the over the top meals the Global Horizons survivors would make for me every time I showed up to interview them. They finished one meal with this plate of perfect  long stemmed strawberries  and as they handed them to me  they said   Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the States  And don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you   As I stood in that grocery store weeks later  I realized I had no idea of who to thank for this plenty  and no idea of how they were being treated. So  like the journalist I am  I started digging into the agricultural sector. And I found there are too many fields  and too few labor inspectors. I found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor  and God knows who else. The Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States on a temporary guest worker program. That guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer  and denies that worker the right to organize. Mind you  none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually human trafficking. It is merely what we find legally tolerable. And I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation. And all of this had been hidden to me  before I had tried to understand it. I wasn't the only person grappling with these issues. Pierre Omidyar  founder of eBay  is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists in the world. And even he wound up accidentally investing nearly    million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that Global Horizons case. When he found out  he and his wife were shocked and horrified  and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper  saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support. I totally agree. What would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains  If we demanded laws calling for the same  If all the CEOs out there decided that they were going to go through their businesses and say   no more   If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers  If we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation  These would be decisions heard around the world. This isn't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day  buying a guilt free zone with your money. That's not how it works. This is the decision to change a system that is broken  and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long. We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization. But that is not my experience of them. Over all the years that I've been talking to them  they have taught me that we are more than our worst days. Each one of us is more than what we have lived through. Especially trafficking survivors. These people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities. They were the people that you would take a gamble on. You'd say  I'm gong to sell my rings  because I have the chance to send you off to a better future. They were the emissaries of hope. These survivors don't need saving. They need solidarity  because they're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today. The nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families    their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers' rights. The Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade    they came together  and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves. These Indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post Hurricane Katrina reconstruction. They were threatened with deportation  but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from New Orleans to Washington  D.C.  to protest labor exploitation. They cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance  and through this organization  they have wound up helping other workers bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in Walmart and Hershey's factories. And although the Department of Justice declined to take their case  a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this February  and got their clients    million dollars. These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet  other workers  and for the possibility of a just world for all of us. This is our chance to do the same. This is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are  as a people and as a society  that our prosperity is no longer prosperity  as long as it is pinned to other people's pain  that our lives are inextricably woven together  and that we have the power to make a different choice. I was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you. Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage  I had told literally a handful of people about it  because  like many a journalist  I am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much  if anything  about my own. I also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this. I haven't issued my mountains of document requests  and interviewed everyone and their mother  and I haven't found my auntie yet. I don't know her story of what happened  and of her life now. The story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished. But I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in  when it comes to human trafficking. We are all implicated in this problem. But that means we are all also part of its solution. Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do  and our story to tell. So let us tell it the way we should have done  from the very beginning. Let us tell this story together. Thank you so much. It was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I worked together as bartenders. Usually at the end of our shift we had a drink    but not that night.  I'm pregnant. Not sure what I'm going to do yet   I told Polly. Without hesitation  she replied   I've had an abortion.  Before Polly  no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion. I'd graduated from college just a few months earlier and I was in a new relationship when I found out that I was pregnant. When I thought about my choices  I honestly did not know how to decide  what criteria I should use. How would I know what the right decision was  I worried that I would regret  an abortion later. Coming of age on the beaches of Southern California  I grew up in the middle of  our nation's abortion wars. I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. Our community was surfing Christians. We cared about God  the less fortunate  and the ocean. Everyone was pro life. As a kid  the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant I could never have one. And then I did. It was a step towards the unknown. But Polly had given me a very special gift  the knowledge that I wasn't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about. Abortion is common. According to the Guttmacher Institute  one in three women in America will have an abortion in their lifetime. But for the last few decades  the dialogue around abortion in the United States has left little room for anything beyond  pro life and pro choice. It's political and polarizing. But as much as abortion is hotly debated  it's still rare for us  whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people  to talk with one another about the abortions that we have. There is a gap. Between what happens in politics and what happens in real life  and in that gap  a battlefield mentality. An  are you with us  or against us   stance takes root. This isn't just about abortion. There are so many important issues  that we can't talk about. And so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life. There are two main ways to get started. One way is to listen closely. And the other way is to share stories. So     years ago  I cofounded an organization called Exhale to start listening to people  who have had abortions. The first thing we did was create  a talk line  where women and men could call to get emotional support. Free of judgment and politics  believe it or not  nothing like our sevice had ever existed. We needed a new framework that could  hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk line. The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic who is grateful for hers. The personal experiences that weren't  fitting neatly into one box or the other. We didn't think it was right  to ask women to pick a side. We wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side  as they were going through this deeply personal experience. So we invented  pro voice.  Beyond abortion  pro voice works on hard issues that we've struggled with globally for years  issues like immigration  religious tolerance  violence against women. It also works on deeply personal topics  that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends. They have a terminal illness   their mother just died  they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it. Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro voice practice. Listening and storytelling. That sounds pretty nice. Sounds maybe  easy  We could all do that. It's not easy. It's very hard. Pro voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about or the things that no one  wants to talk about. I wish I could tell you that when you  decide to be pro voice  that you'll find beautiful moments of breakthrough  and gardens full of flowers  where listening and storytelling creates wonderful  a ha  moments. I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you  or that there's a long lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed. But it can be vulnerable and exhausting  to tell our own stories when it feels like nobody cares. And if we truly listen to one another  we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions. There is no perfect time and there is no perfect place to start a difficult conversation. There's never a time when everyone will be on the same page  share the same lens  or know the same history. So  let's talk about listening and how to be a good listener. There's lots of ways to be a good listener and I'm going to give you just a couple. One is to ask open ended questions. You can ask yourself or someone  that you know   How are you feeling    What was that like    What do you hope for  now   Another way to be a good listener  is to use reflective language. If someone is talking about their own personal experience  use the words that they use. If someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word  baby   you can say  baby.  If they say  fetus   you can say  fetus.  If someone describes themselves as gender queer to you  you can say  gender queer.  If someone kind of looks like a he  but they say they're a she    it's cool. Call that person a she. When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story  we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are and what they're going through. The same way that we hope people are  interested in knowing us. So  I'll never forget being in one  of the Exhale counselor meetings  listening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls from Christian women who  were talking about God. Now  some of our volunteers are religious  but this particular one was not. At first  it felt a little weird for her  to talk to callers about God. So  she decided to get comfortable. And she stood in front of her mirror  at home  and she said the word  God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.   God.  Over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth. Saying the word God did not turn this  volunteer into a Christian  but it did make her a much  better listener of Christian women. So  another way to be pro voice is to share stories  and one risk that you take on  when you share your story with someone else  is that given the same set of circumstances as you they might actually make a different decision. For example  if you're telling a story  about your abortion  realize that she might have had the baby. She might have placed for adoption. She might have told her parents  and her partner    or not. She might have felt relief and confidence  even though you felt sad and lost. This is okay. Empathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes. It doesn't mean we all have  to end up in the same place. It's not agreement  it's not sameness that pro voice is after. It creates a culture and a society that  values what make us special and unique. It values what makes us human  our flaws and our imperfections. And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect  instead of fear. And it generates the empathy that we need to overcome all the ways that we try to hurt one another. Stigma  shame  prejudice   discrimination  oppression. Pro voice is contagious  and the more it's practiced the more it spreads. So  last year I was pregnant again. This time I was looking forward  to the birth of my son. And while pregnant  I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life. And however I replied  whether I was feeling wonderful and excited or scared and totally freaked out  there was always someone there giving me a  been there  response. It was awesome. It was a welcome  yet dramatic departure from what I experience when I talk about my mixed feelings of my abortion. Pro voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues are understood and discussed. From sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration. Far beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions  our experiences can exist on a spectrum. Pro voice focuses that conversation on human experience and it makes support and respect possible for all. Thank you. Alec Soth  So about    years ago  I got a call from a woman in Texas  Stacey Baker  and she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents. Now  at the time I hadn't met Stacey  and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich  but it was only later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen. I took the picture of her parents  but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey. The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best known portraits. At the time I made this picture  Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas. Not long after  she left her job to study photography in Maine  and while she was there  she ended up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job. Stacey Baker  In the years since  Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together  and we've become friends. A few months ago  I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine. I've always been obsessed with how couples meet. I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met  and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was    and he was     and he asked her out. He liked her purple hair. She said yes  and that was it. I then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question. AS  And I was interested in the question  but I was actually much more interested in Stacey's motivation for asking it  particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend. So as part of this project  I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone. So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day. SB  We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event. I had    dates and each date lasted three minutes. Participants were given a list of ice  breaker questions to get the ball rolling  things like   If you could be any kind of animal  what would you be   That sort of thing. My first date was Colin. He's from England  and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn. Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening  and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands. Zack and Chris came to the date a thon together. This is Carl. I asked Carl   What's the first thing you notice about a woman   He said   Tits.  Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves. We talked about running. He does triathlons  I run half marathons. Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him  but I wasn't  and I don't think he was attracted to me either. Austin and Mike came together. Mike asked me a hypothetical question. He said   You're in an elevator running late for a meeting. Someone makes a dash for the elevator. Do you hold it open for them   And I said I would not. Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth  and we complimented each other's teeth. Because he's an open mouth sleeper  he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease  and so I asked him how often he flosses  and he said   Every other day.  Now  as someone who flosses twice a day  I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more but I don't think I said that out loud. Bill is an auditor  and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing.  Laughter  The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion. He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup  and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have. I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing. Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable. He was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment. He thought I was lying  but I wasn't. I didn't think he liked me at all  but at the end of the night  he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates. William was really difficult to talk to. I think he was drunk. Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event. He used to be on  The Young and the Restless.  I didn't actually go on a date with him. Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him. Needless to say  I didn't fall in love. I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with  and I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either. AS  Now  the most beautiful thing to me    The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior. At this date a thon event  I saw so many examples of that  but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them  I realized how different photographic love is from real love. What is real love  How does it work  In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together  Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin  which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas. Our contact there was George  who runs the community's photography club. He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio. SB  After    years of marriage  Anastasia's husband died two years ago  so we asked if she had an old wedding picture. She met her husband when she was a    year old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan. He was   . She'd lied about her age. He was the first person she'd dated. Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row  and this caught Alec's attention  as did the fact  that he met his wife  Judy  at the same age when Alec met Rachel. Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women  but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy. AS  George met Josephine at a parish dance. He was     she was   . Like a lot of the couples we met  they weren't especially philosophical about their early choices. George said something that really stuck with me. He said   When you get that feeling  you just go with it.  Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school. They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other when the first met. Nevertheless  they were married soon after. SB  The story that stayed with me the most was that of George  the photography club president  and his wife  Mary. This was George and Mary's second marriage. They met at a country western club in Louisville  Kentucky called the Sahara. He was there alone drinking and she was with friends. When they started dating  he owed the IRS       dollars in taxes  and she offered to help him get out of debt  so for the next year  he turned his paychecks over to Mary  and she got him out of debt. George was actually an alcoholic when they married  and Mary knew it. At some point in their marriage  he says he consumed    beers in one day. Another time  when he was drunk  he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids  but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house. Amazingly  Mary took him back  and eventually things got better. George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in    years. At the end of the day  after we left Sun City  I told Alec that I didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting. What was more interesting was how they managed to stay together. AS  They all had this beautiful quality of endurance  but that was true of the singles  too. The world is hard  and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people  and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades. My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne. Now  by the time we met Joe and Roseanne  we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph. In their case  they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph. What's more beautiful  I thought to myself  this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades  Thank you. This back here was my brain cancer. Isn't it nice  The key phrase is  was   phew. Having brain cancer was really  as you can imagine  shocking news for me. I knew nothing about cancer. In Western cultures  when you have cancer  it's as if you disappear in a way. Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data  Your images  your exams  your lab values  a list of medicines. And everyone changes as well. You suddenly become a disease on legs. Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand. They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images. People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease  instead of with the human being. They say   What did the doctor say   before even saying   Hello.  And in the meanwhile  you're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer. These are the  Can I   questions  Can I work while I have cancer  Can I study  Can I make love  Can I be creative  And you wonder   What have I done to deserve this   You wonder   Can I change something about my lifestyle   You wonder   Can I do something  Are there any other options   And  obviously  doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios  because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you. But they also are very used to having to deal with patients  so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become  literally  a patient     patient  means  the one who waits.  Things are changing  but classically  they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition  to get your friends and family engaged  or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through. But instead  you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers. While I was in the hospital  I asked for a printed out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it. It was really hard to obtain  because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer. I talked to it and I said   Okay  cancer  you're not all there is to me. There's more to me. A cure  whichever it is  will have to deal with the whole of me.  And so  the next day  I left the hospital against medical advice. I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery. I'm an artist  I use several forms of open source technologies and open information in my practice. So my best bet was to get it all out there  get the information out there  and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone. So I created a website  which is called La Cura  on which I put my medical data  online. I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech. I chose this word  La Cura    La Cura in Italian means  the cure     because in many different cultures  the word  cure  can mean many different things. In our Western cultures  it means eradicating or reversing a disease  but in different cultures  for example  a culture from Asia  from the Mediterranean  from Latin countries  from Africa  it can mean many more things. Of course  I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers  but I was also interested in the cure of the artist  of the poet  of the designer  of  who knows  the musicians. I was interested in the social cure  I was interested in the psychological cure  I was interested in the spiritual cure  I was interested in the emotional cure  I was interested in any form of cure. And  it worked. The La Cura website went viral. I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than         contacts    emails  social networking    most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer  but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual. For example  many thousands of videos  images  pictures  art performances were produced for La Cura. For example  here we see Francesca Fini in her performance. Or  as artist Patrick Lichty has done  He produced a  D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse. Now you can have my cancer  too  Which is a nice thing  if you think about it  we can share our cancer. And this was going on    scientists  the traditional medicine experts  several researchers  doctors    all connected with me to give advice. With all this information and support  I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons  traditional doctors  oncologists  and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving  which is very important. And together  we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages  according to many cultures. And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history  which is quite remarkable for me.  Surgery  The follow up MRIs showed  luckily  little to no growth of the cancer. So I was able to take my time and choose. I chose the doctor I wanted to work with  I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in  and in the meanwhile  I was supported by thousands of people  none of whom felt pity for me. Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well  and this was the most important part of La Cura. What are the outcomes  I'm fine  as you can see  pretty fine. I had excellent news after the surgery    I have    I had a very low grade glioma  which is a  good  kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot. I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle. Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged. Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery  which was very intense  a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side  to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls. And right before the operation  we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor  to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid. Obviously  there were.  Open  And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura. Thousands of people shared their stories  their experiences. Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer. I'm a self founding  continuous state of translation among many different languages  in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research.  Society  The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components. This global performance is my open source cure for cancer. And from what I feel  it's a cure for me  but for us all. Thank you. So  people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying. At least  according to a       Book of Lists  survey which preceded all those online best  worst  funniest lists that you see today. Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six legged as sources of fear. And I suspect if you had put spiders in there  the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart. Now  I am not one of those people. I really love insects. I think they're interesting and beautiful  and sometimes even cute. And I'm not alone. For centuries  some of the greatest minds in science  from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson  have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth. Well  why is that  What is that keeps us coming back to insects  Some of it  of course  is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them. They're more numerous than any other kind of animal. We don't even know how many species of insects there are  because new ones are being discovered all the time. There are at least a million  maybe as many as    million. This means that you could have an insect of the month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over        years. Take that  pandas and kittens  More seriously  insects are essential. We need them. It's been estimated that   out of every   bites of food is made possible by a pollinator. Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work. But what I love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior. Insects seem like they do everything that people do. They meet  they mate  they fight  they break up. And they do so with what looks like love or animosity. But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own  and that difference can be really illuminating. There's nowhere where that's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests    sex. Now  I will maintain. and I think I can defend  what may seem like a surprising statement. I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people. And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female. Of course  to start with  a lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce. Female aphids can make little  tiny clones of themselves without ever mating. Virgin birth  right there. On your rose bushes. When they do have sex  even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm. There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body. And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete. Now  male insects do compete with weapons  like the horns on these beetles. But they also compete after mating with their sperm. Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out. They use these formidable devices like scoops  to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with. So  what can we learn from this  All right  it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow. Which  given this  is probably just as well. And also  did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects  So  no  that's not the point. But what I think insects do  is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles. So  people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a     s sitcom version of what males and females are like. So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive  and females are passive and coy. But that's just not the case. So for example  take katydids  which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers. The males are very picky about who they mate with  because they not only transfer sperm during mating  they also give the female something called a nuptial gift. You can see two katydids mating in these photos. In both panels  the male's the one on the right  and that sword like appendage is the female's egg laying organ. The white blob is the sperm  the green blob is the nuptial gift  and the male manufactures this from his own body and it's extremely costly to produce. It can weigh up to a third of his body mass. I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men  every time they had sex  had to produce something that weighed            pounds. Okay  they would not be able to do that very often. And indeed  neither can the katydids. And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to. Now  the gift is very nutritious  and the female eats it during and after mating. So  the bigger it is  the better off the male is  because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs. But it also means that the males are very passive about mating  whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive  in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can. So  it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules. Even more generally though  males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects. In the social insects    the bees and wasps and ants    the individuals that you see every day    the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl  the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower    all of those are always female. People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia. The ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees  the drones  that are larger than the workers  although they disapproved of the drones' laziness because they could see that the drones just hang around the hive until the mating flight    they're the males. They hang around until the mating flight  but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen. The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex  and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female. Aristotle tried to get involved as well. He suggested   OK  if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ...  Then he got confused  because that would have meant the males were also taking care of the young in a colony  and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible. He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes in the same individual  which is not that far fetched  some animals do that  but he never really did get it figured out. And you know  even today  my students  for instance  call every animal they see  including insects  a male. And when I tell them that the ferocious army ant soldiers with their giant jaws  used to defend the colony  are all always female  they seem to not quite believe me. And certainly all of the movies    Antz  Bee Movie    portray the main character in the social insects as being male. Well  what difference does this make  These are movies. They're fiction. They have talking animals in them. What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld  I think it does matter  and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives. You all know that scientists use what we call model systems  which are creatures    white rats or fruit flies    that are kind of stand ins for all other animals  including people. And the idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat. And by and large  that turns out to be the case. But you can take the idea of a model system too far. And what I think we've done  is use males  in any species  as though they are the model system. The norm. The way things are supposed to be. And females as a kind of variant    something special that you only study after you get the basics down. And so  back to the insects. I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them. Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor  walk on roles. But when we do that  we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like. And we can also miss out on the way natural  living things  including people  can vary. And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research  something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women. Well  the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them. They have little  tiny brains with very little cognitive ability  the way we normally think of it. They have complicated behavior  but they lack complicated brains. And so  we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do. I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects  to look at them and just think of them like they're little people in exoskeletons  with six legs. Instead  you really have to accept them on their own terms  because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural. Now  you know  people write fiction and talk about parallel universes. They speculate about the supernatural  maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us. The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal. But as far as I'm concerned  who needs to be able to see dead people  when you can see live insects  Thank you. In the early days of Twitter  it was like a place of radical de shaming. People would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  Voiceless people realized that they had a voice  and it was powerful and eloquent. If a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column  we realized we could do something about it. We could get them. We could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't    a social media shaming. Advertisers would withdraw their advertising. When powerful people misused their privilege  we were going to get them. This was like the democratization of justice. Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better. Soon after that  a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer    he'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes  and he was drenched in shame and regret  he told me. And he had the opportunity to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch. This was going to be the most important speech of his life. Maybe it would win him some salvation. He knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live streaming his event  but what he didn't know until he turned up  was that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head. Another one in a monitor screen in his eye line. I don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous. I think they were clueless  I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality. And here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line  as he was trying to apologize   Jonah Lehrer  boring us into forgiving him.  And   Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame.  That one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever  to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern. And   Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath.  That last word is a very human thing to do  to dehumanize the people we hurt. It's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it. Imagine if this was an actual court  and the accused was in the dark  begging for another chance  and the jury was yelling out   Bored  Sociopath   You know  when we watch courtroom dramas  we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney  but give us the power  and we become like hanging judges. Power shifts fast. We were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege  but Jonah was on the floor then  and we were still kicking  and congratulating ourselves for punching up. And it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get. A day without a shaming began to feel like a day picking fingernails and treading water. Let me tell you a story. It's about a woman called Justine Sacco. She was a PR woman from New York with     Twitter followers  and she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them  like this one on a plane from New York to London   Weird German Dude  You're in first class. It's     . Get some deodorant.   Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.  So Justine chuckled to herself  and pressed send  and got no replies  and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny. Black silence when the Internet doesn't talk back. And then she got to Heathrow  and she had a little time to spare before her final leg  so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke   Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white   And she chuckled to herself  pressed send  got on the plane  got no replies  turned off her phone  fell asleep  woke up    hours later  turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway  and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn't spoken to since high school  that said   I am so sorry to see what's happening to you.  And then another message from a best friend   You need to call me right now. You are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter.  What had happened is that one of her     followers had sent the Tweet to a Gawker journalist  and he retweeted it to his        followers   And now  a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss  And then it was like a bolt of lightning. A few weeks later  I talked to the Gawker journalist. I emailed him and asked him how it felt  and he said   It felt delicious.  And then he said   But I'm sure she's fine.  But she wasn't fine  because while she slept  Twitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece. First there were the philanthropists   If  JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you  join me in supporting  CARE's work in Africa.   In light of ... disgusting  racist tweet  I'm donating to  care today  Then came the beyond horrified   ... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.  Was anybody on Twitter that night  A few of you. Did Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine  It did mine  and I thought what everybody thought that night  which was   Wow  somebody's screwed  Somebody's life is about to get terrible   And I sat up in my bed  and I put the pillow behind my head  and then I thought  I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist. Maybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege  she was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege. There's a comedy tradition of this  like South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman. Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman. In fact  when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar  she was just crushed  and I asked her to explain the joke  and she said   Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World. I was making of fun of that bubble.  You know  another woman on Twitter that night  a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis  she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night   I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist   and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying   Well  you're just a privileged bitch  too.  And so to her shame  she wrote  she shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart. It started to get darker   Everyone go report this cunt  JustineSacco  Then came the calls for her to be fired.  Good luck with the job hunt in the new year.  GettingFired  Thousands of people around the world decided it was their duty to get her fired.   JustineSacco last tweet of your career.  SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved  hoping to sell their products on the back of Justine's annihilation   Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off  make sure you are getting on a  Gogo flight   A lot of companies were making good money that night. You know  Justine's name was normally Googled    times a month. That month  between December the   th and the end of December  her name was Googled           times. And one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made somewhere between         dollars and         dollars from Justine's annihilation  whereas those of us doing the actual shaming    we got nothing. We were like unpaid shaming interns for Google. And then came the trolls   I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids  lol  Somebody else on that wrote   Somebody HIV positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS.  And that person got a free pass. Nobody went after that person. We were all so excited about destroying Justine  and our shaming brains are so simple minded  that we couldn't also handle destroying somebody who was inappropriately destroying Justine. Justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night  from philanthropists to  rape the bitch.    JustineSacco I hope you get fired  You demented bitch... Just let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa.  Women always have it worse than men. When a man gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired.  When a woman gets shamed  it's   I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus.  And then Justine's employers got involved   IAC on  JustineSacco tweet  This is an outrageous  offensive comment. Employee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight.  And that's when the anger turned to excitement   All I want for Christmas is to see  JustineSacco's face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox voicemail.  fired   Oh man   justinesacco is going to have the most painful phone turning on moment ever when her plane lands.   We are about to watch this  JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she's getting fired.  What we had was a delightful narrative arc. We knew something that Justine didn't. Can you think of anything less judicial than this  Justine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself  and her inability was a huge part of the hilarity. On Twitter that night  we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun. Somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on  so they linked to a flight tracker website.  British Airways Flight    On time   arrives in   hour    minutes  A hashtag began trending worldwide    hasJustineLandedYet   It is kinda wild to see someone self destruct without them even being aware of it.  hasJustineLandedYet   Seriously. I just want to go home to go to bed  but everyone at the bar is SO into  HasJustineLandedYet. Can't look away. Can't leave.    HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night.   Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival  Come on  twitter  I'd like pictures  And guess what  Yes there was.   JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international. And if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke  not by trolls  but by nice people like us  this is what it looks like   ... She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise.  So why did we do it  I think some people were genuinely upset  but I think for other people  it's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine. We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do  and we approve each other  and that's a really good feeling. And if somebody gets in the way  we screen them out. And do you know what that's the opposite of  It's the opposite of democracy. We wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa. Our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit this profoundly un compassionate act. As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review   This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative.  For the past three years  I've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco    and believe me  there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco. There's more every day. And we want to think they're fine  but they're not fine. The people I met were mangled. They talked to me about depression  and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts. One woman I talked to  who also told a joke that landed badly  she stayed home for a year and a half. Before that  she worked with adults with learning difficulties  and was apparently really good at her job. Justine was fired  of course  because social media demanded it. But it was worse than that. She was losing herself. She was waking up in the middle of the night  forgetting who she was. She was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege. And of course  that's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for  like having children out of wedlock. But the phrase  misuse of privilege  is becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to. It's becoming a devalued term  and it's making us lose our capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions. Justine had     Twitter followers  and so to make it work  she had to be fictionalized. Word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.  Let us not be fooled by  JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire. She's not sorry. And neither is her father.  I thought that was true about Justine  until I met her at a bar  and I asked her about her billionaire father  and she said   My father sells carpets.  And I think back on the early days of Twitter  when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves  and other people would say   Oh my God  I'm exactly the same.  These days  the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets. You can lead a good  ethical life  but some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all  become a clue to your secret inner evil. Maybe there's two types of people in the world  those people who favor humans over ideology  and those people who favor ideology over humans. I favor humans over ideology  but right now  the ideologues are winning  and they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas where everybody's either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain  even though we know that's not true about our fellow humans. What's true is that we are clever and stupid  what's true is that we're grey areas. The great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people  but we're now creating a surveillance society  where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless. Let's not do that. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Jon. Jon Ronson  Thanks  Bruno. BG  Don't go away. What strikes me about Justine's story is also the fact that if you Google her name today  this story covers the first     pages of Google results    there is nothing else about her. In your book  you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm  and by creating blogs and posting nice  innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff  managed to get the story off the first couple pages of Google results  but it didn't last long. A couple of weeks later  they started creeping back up to the top result. Is this a totally lost battle  Jon Ronson  You know  I think the very best thing we can do  if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming  is to speak up  because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her    like  everyone was against her  and that is profoundly traumatizing  to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices  like in a democracy  where people are discussing it  I think that's much less damaging. So I think that's the way forward  but it's hard  because if you do stand up for somebody  it's incredibly unpleasant. BG  So let's talk about your experience  because you stood up by writing this book. By the way  it's mandatory reading for everybody  okay  You stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter. JR  It didn't go down that well with some people. I mean  you don't want to just concentrate    because lots of people understood  and were really nice about the book. But yeah  for    years I've been writing stories about abuses of power  and when I say the powerful people over there in the military  or in the pharmaceutical industry  everybody applauds me. As soon as I say   We are the powerful people abusing our power now   I get people saying   Well you must be a racist too.  BG  So the other night    yesterday    we were at dinner  and there were two discussions going on. On one side you were talking with people around the table    and that was a nice  constructive discussion. On the other  every time you turned to your phone  there is this deluge of insults. JR  Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovely and nice  and I decided to check Twitter. Somebody said   You are a white supremacist.  And then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody  and then I went back to Twitter  somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the     s  when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other and shooting each other  and then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer  and I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option. BG  Jon  thank you. JR  Thank you  Bruno. So on my way here  the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation during my flight. He told me   It seems like the United States has run out of jobs  because they're just making some up  cat psychologist  dog whisperer  tornado chaser.  A couple of seconds later  he asked me   So what do you do   And I was like   Peacebuilder   Every day  I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution  and because of my work  I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion. Now  this matter is vitally important to me. As a young Muslim woman  I am very proud of my faith. It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day. It's the reason I can be here in front of you. But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion  not just my own  but all of the world's major faiths. The misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture has influenced our social and cultural norms  our laws  our daily lives  to a point where we sometimes don't recognize it. My parents moved from Libya  North Africa  to Canada in the early     s  and I am the middle child of    children. Yes    . But growing up  I saw my parents  both religiously devout and spiritual people  pray and praise God for their blessings  namely me of course  but among others.  Laughter  They were kind and funny and patient  limitlessly patient  the kind of patience that having    kids forces you to have. And they were fair. I was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens. I was treated the same  the same was expected of me. I was never taught that God judged differently based on gender. And my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend and provider shaped the way I looked at the world. Now  of course  my upbringing had additional benefits. Being one of    children is Diplomacy    .  Laughter  To this day  I am asked where I went to school  like   Did you go to Kennedy School of Government   and I look at them and I'm like   No  I went to the Murabit School of International Affairs.  It's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in. Lucky for you  she's here. But being one of    children and having    siblings teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances. It teaches you focus  you have to talk fast or say less  because you will always get cut off. It teaches you the importance of messaging. You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want  and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace. But the most important lesson I learned growing up was the importance of being at the table. When my mom's favorite lamp broke  I had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who  because I had to defend myself  because if you're not  then the finger is pointed at you  and before you know it  you will be grounded. I am not speaking from experience  of course. When I was    in       I completed high school and I moved from Canada    Saskatoon    to Zawiya  my parents' hometown in Libya  a very traditional city. Mind you  I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation  and as a seven year old girl  it was magic. It was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives. Turns out it's not the same as a    year old young lady. I very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion. The words  haram     meaning religiously prohibited    and  aib     meaning culturally inappropriate    were exchanged carelessly  as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences. And I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues  professors  friends  even relatives  beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations. And even with the foundation my parents had provided for me  I found myself questioning the role of women in my faith. So at the Murabit School of International Affairs  we go very heavy on the debate  and rule number one is do your research  so that's what I did  and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders  who were innovative  who were strong    politically  economically  even militarily. Khadija financed the Islamic movement in its infancy. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her. So why weren't we learning about her  Why weren't we learning about these women  Why were women being relegated to positions which predated the teachings of our faith  And why  if we are equal in the eyes of God  are we not equal in the eyes of men  To me  it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child. The decision maker  the person who gets to control the message  is sitting at the table  and unfortunately  in every single world faith  they are not women. Religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership  and they create policies in their likeness  and until we can change the system entirely  then we can't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women. Our foundation is broken. My mom actually says  you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation. In       the Libyan revolution broke out  and my family was on the front lines. And there's this amazing thing that happens in war  a cultural shift almost  very temporary. And it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved  but it was encouraged. It was demanded. Myself and other women had a seat at the table. We weren't holding hands or a medium. We were part of decision making. We were information sharing. We were crucial. And I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent. Turns out  that's not that easy. It only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles  and most of them were driven by words of encouragement from religious and political leaders  most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense. It's how they gained popular support for their opinions. So initially  I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women. I thought that would lead to cultural and social change. It turns out  it does a little  but not a lot. I decided to use their defense as my offense  and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well. In      and       my organization led the single largest and most widespread campaign in Libya. We entered homes and schools and universities  even mosques. We spoke to        people directly  and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials  radio commercials and posters. And you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed our sheer existence. I used scripture. I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet  Hadiths  his sayings which are  for example   The best of you is the best to their family.   Do not let your brother oppress another.  For the first time  Friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women. They discussed taboo issues  like domestic violence. Policies were changed. In certain communities  we actually had to go as far as saying the International Human Rights Declaration  which you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars  well  those same principles are in our book. So really  the United Nations just copied us. By changing the message  we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya. It's something that has now been replicated internationally  and while I am not saying it's easy    believe me  it's not. Liberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative. Conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things. I've heard everything from   Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you     false  they're my biggest fans    to  You will not make it to your next birthday     again wrong  because I did. And I remain a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive. But we have to be at the table. We have to stop giving up our position  because by remaining silent  we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide. By saying that we're going to fight for women's rights and fight extremism with bombs and warfare  we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues so that they're sustainable. It is not easy  challenging distorted religious messaging. You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats. But we have to do it. We have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights  the principles of our faith  not for us  not for the women in your families  not for the women in this room  not even for the women out there  but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women. And the only way we can do that  our only option  is to be  and remain  at the table. Thank you. This is a map of New York State that was made in      by the General Drafting Company. It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds  because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains  there is a little town called Roscoe    actually  this will go easier if I just put it up here    There's Roscoe  and then right above Roscoe is Rockland  New York  and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe  New York. Agloe  New York  is very famous to cartographers  because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers    because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar  on account of the shape of New York    often  mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps  in order to protect their copyright. Because then  if my fake place shows up on your map  I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map  Ernest Alpers and Otto  G.  Lindberg  and they released this map in     . Decades later  Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe  New York  on it  at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. Well  you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. They immediately call Rand McNally  and they say   We've caught you  We made Agloe  New York  up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off   And Rand McNally says   No  no  no  no  Agloe is real.  Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads    in the middle of nowhere  expecting there to be a place called Agloe    someone built a place called Agloe  New York. It had a gas station  a general store  two houses at its peak. And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist  because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living  which is why my third book is called  Paper Towns . But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened  is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world  right  Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world. Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose    sort of  our personal cartographic enterprise  also shapes the map of our lives  and that in turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map changes the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some  like  secret y Oprah's Angels network  like  you can think your way  out of cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life  they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map. So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low  s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me  and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles  because they seemed completely arbitrary  so I often wouldn't  and then people would threaten me  you know  they'd threaten me with this  going on  my  permanent record   or  You'll never get a good job.  I didn't want a good job  As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old  like  people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning  and the men who had good jobs  one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves  and then they went off to their jobs  whatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people    in my  symbol obsessed  twelve year old imagination    these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning  they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end  That's a terrible end  And then  when I was in tenth grade  I went to this school  Indian Springs School  a small boarding school  outside of Birmingham  Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner  because I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement  and who thought that my ironic oh so cool disengagement wasn't clever  or funny  but  like  it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems. And so I started to learn  because learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets  and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict  I learned some physics  I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation    all of these things  by the way  enriched my life on a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use most of them for my  job   but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography. What is the process of cartography  It's  you know  sailing upon some land  and thinking   I think I'll draw that bit of land   and then wondering   Maybe there's some more land to draw.  And that's when learning really began for me. It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me  and I was very fortunate to have those teachers  because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom  it was about what happened outside of the classroom. For instance  I can tell you that  There's a certain Slant of light  Winter Afternoons    That oppresses  like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes     not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school  but because there was a girl when I was in high school  and her name was Amanda  and I had a crush on her  and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is  is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch  my friend Emmet walked in  and he said   How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart   And I said   I don't know  like  six hours   and he said   Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin Robbins those six hours  you could have made    dollars  so in some ways  you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart.  And I was  like   I'll take that deal.  But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way  the map of my life got better. It got bigger  it contained more places. There were more things that might happen  more futures I might have. It wasn't a formal  organized learning process  and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty  it was inconsistent  there was a lot I didn't know. I might know  you know  Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets  but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost  but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography  instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over  is that you see a bit of coastline  and that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. So  I had one learning community in high school  then I went to another for college  and then I went to another  when I started working at a magazine called  Booklist   where I was an assistant  surrounded by astonishingly well read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing  I promptly quit my job. And for the first time since high school  I found myself without a learning community  and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many  many books during this two year period. I read books about Stalin  and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims  and I read books about how to make atomic bombs  but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles  and then jumping over them myself  instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners  a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us. And then  in       I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him  just on the Internet. Ze Frank was running  at the time  a show called  The Show with Ze Frank   and I discovered the show  and that was my way back into being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas  Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else    the sort of rocks  the trees  the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place  so are these people. Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here  away from their histories  and away from the people that experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made    even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here  there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context  and that means context allows for everything  Self Parking  Events Center  Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements  because no one belongs here  everyone does. As I walked around this morning  I noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors  which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place  these mirrors come back empty. John Green  Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video. Ze isn't just a great public intellectual  he's also a brilliant community builder  and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively  and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich  by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth  and on the exact opposite point of the Earth  have another person holding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas  but they are also  learny  ideas  and that was what was so exciting to me  and if you go online  you can find communities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr  and yes  you will see people complaining about calculus  but you'll also see people re blogging those complaints  making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful  and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit  and find sub Reddits  like  Ask a Historian  or  Ask Science   where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions  from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me  the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube  and admittedly  I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways  the YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at  Minute Physics   a guy who's teaching the world about physics  As of July          the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. But  you might ask  why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model  alongside well known particles like electrons and photons and quarks  if it hadn't been discovered back then in the     s  Good question. There are two main reasons. First  just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field  the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular  the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this in a later video  but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the     s  in the equations  the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force  that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence. JG  Or here's a video that I made as part of my show  Crash Course   talking about World War I  of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand  on June           by a Bosnian Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside  It's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well liked by his uncle  the emperor Franz Joseph    now that is a mustache  But even so  the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia  whereupon Serbia accepted some  but not all  of Austria's demands  leading Austria to declare war against Serbia. And then Russia  due to its alliance with the Serbs  mobilized its army. Germany  because it had an alliance with Austria  told Russia to stop mobilizing  which Russia failed to do  so then Germany mobilized its own army  declared war on Russia  cemented an alliance with the Ottomans  and then declared war on France  because  you know  France. And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics. because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about  I don't know  the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic  right  Which is odd  because it's a cool topic  but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. So  in a quite understandable need for distraction  you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of  series  should be than about the topic at hand   serieses    seriese    seriesen   and  serii   Or is it that the singular should be changed  one  serie   or  serum   just like the singular of  sheep  should be  shoop.  But the whole concept of things like                        and so on approaches one  is useful if  say  you want to draw a line of elephants  each holding the tail of the next one  normal elephant  young elephant  baby elephant  dog sized elephant  puppy sized elephant  all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome  because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line  and still have it fit across a single notebook page. JG  And lastly  here's Destin  from  Smarter Every Day   talking about the conservation of angular momentum  and  since it's YouTube  cats  So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. Today's question is  why  Like most simple questions  there's a very complex answer. For instance  let me reword this question  How does a cat go from feet up to feet down in a falling reference frame  without violating the conservation of angular momentum  JG  So  here's something all four of these videos have in common  They all have more than half a million views on YouTube. And those are people watching not in classrooms  but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me  and in many ways it is  because here is the instructor    it's like the old fashioned classroom  here's the instructor  and then beneath the instructor are the students  and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet  but in fact  if you go on comments for these channels  what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter  asking difficult  complicated questions that are about the subject matter  and then other people answering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you is on the exact    the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments  you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually  I get to participate with you. And you find this whether it's world history  or mathematics  or science  or whatever it is. You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement  instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions    you know   Got bored. Invented calculus.  Or  here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism    Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary  it is the vehicle of savage  destructive nihilism.   In case you can't see what she says ... yeah. I really believe that these spaces  these communities  have become for a new generation of learners  the kind of communities  the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school  and then again when I was in college. And as an adult  re finding these communities has re introduced me to a community of learners  and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood  so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and  Minute Physics  introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment  or to the Algonquin Round Table  and wish   Oh  I wish I could have been a part of that  I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes.  But I'm here to tell you that these places exist  they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet  where old men fear to tread. And I truly  truly believe that when we invented Agloe  New York  in the     s  when we made Agloe real  we were just getting started. Thank you. In       when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab s  in the south of Tunisia  I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. At the beginning  I was just looking for a wall in my hometown  and it happened that the minaret was built in '  . And for    years  those    meters of concrete stayed grey. When I met the imam for the first time  and I told him what I wanted to do  he was like   Thank God you finally came   and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything    neither a sketch  or what I was going to write. In every work that I create  I write messages with my style of calligraffiti    a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. I use quotes or poetry. For the minaret  I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran  so I picked this verse   Oh humankind  we have created you from a male and a female  and made you people and tribe  so you may know each other.  It was a universal call for peace  tolerance  and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting  and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. For the imam  it was not just the painting  it was really deeper than that. He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city  and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. The universality of the message  the political context of Tunisia at this time  and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. It reunited the community. Bringing people  future generations  together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. What is funny  actually  is that even Arabic speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. Arabic script speaks to anyone  I believe  to you  to you  to you  to anybody  and then when you get the meaning  you feel connected to it. I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting  but messages that have a universal dimension  so anybody around the world can connect to it. I was born and raised in France  in Paris  and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was   . Today I only write messages in Arabic. One of the reasons this is so important to me  is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. In Rio de Janeiro  I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela T rres Barbosa  who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela  and then I painted it on the rooftop. The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing  but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy  they thanked me  as they felt connected to the piece. In South Africa  in Cape Town  the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. It was a school  and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela  saying    in Arabic    which means   It seems impossible until it's done.  Then this guy came to me and said   Man  why you don't write in English   and I replied to him   I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.  In Paris  once  there was this event  and someone gave his wall to be painted. And when he saw I was painting in Arabic  he got so mad    actually  hysterical    and he asked for the wall to be erased. I was mad and disappointed. But a week later  the organizer of the event asked me to come back  and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. So  this guy    like  was forced to see it every day. At the beginning  I was going to write    In Arabic    which means   In your face   but    I decided to be smarter and I wrote    In Arabic    which means   Open your heart.  I'm really proud of my culture  and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know  with the beauty of Arabic script. Today  I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken  as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning  as you can enjoy any music from other countries. Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door  but for me  it's more an invitation    to my language  to my culture  and to my art. Thank you. Seventy thousand years ago  our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today  in contrast  we control this planet. And the question is  How did we come from there to here  How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes  minding their own business in a corner of Africa  into the rulers of planet Earth  Usually  we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe    I want to believe    that there is something special about me  about my body  about my brain  that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig  or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that  on the individual level  I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island  and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better  I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee  not on myself. And this is not something wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one of you  and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island  the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level  it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now  there are other animals    like the social insects  the bees  the ants    that can cooperate in large numbers  but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger  the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. They cannot  for example  execute the queen and establish a republic of bees  or a communist dictatorship of worker bees. Other animals  like the social mammals    the wolves  the elephants  the dolphins  the chimpanzees    they can cooperate much more flexibly  but they do so only in small numbers  because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge  one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee  and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you  Are you a nice chimpanzee  Are you an evil chimpanzee  Are you trustworthy  If I don't know you  how can I cooperate with you  The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us  Homo sapiens. One versus one  or even    versus     chimpanzees might be better than us. But  if you pit       humans against       chimpanzees  the humans will win easily  for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram         chimpanzees into Oxford Street  or into Wembley Stadium  or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican  you will get chaos  complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with         chimpanzees. Complete madness. In contrast  humans normally gather there in tens of thousands  and what we get is not chaos  usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history  whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon  have been based not on individual abilities  but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now  I'm standing here in front of an audience of about     or     people  most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly  I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here  yesterday  to London. I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras  which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet  somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. Nevertheless  even though we don't know each other  we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate  of course  but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants  or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is  of course  not always nice  all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history    and we have been doing some very horrible things    all those things are also based on large scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation  slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation  concentration camps are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps. Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes  we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is  How  exactly  do we do it  What enables us alone  of all the animals  to cooperate in such a way  The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers  because we alone  of all the animals on the planet  can create and believe fictions  fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction  everybody obeys and follows the same rules  the same norms  the same values. All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say   Look  There's a lion  let's run away   Or   Look  There's a banana tree over there  Let's go and get bananas   Humans  in contrast  use their language not merely to describe reality  but also to create new realities  fictional realities. A human can say   Look  there is a god above the clouds  And if you don't do what I tell you to do  when you die  God will punish you and send you to hell.  And if you all believe this story that I've invented  then you will follow the same norms and laws and values  and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him   ... after you die  you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...   ... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.  No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories  which is why we control the world  whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories. Now you may find it acceptable that yes  in the religious field  humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad  because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass scale human cooperation  not only in the religious field. Take  for example  the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights  Human rights  just like God and heaven  are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality  they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being  cut him open  look inside  you will find the heart  the kidneys  neurons  hormones  DNA  but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories  very good stories  but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented. The same is true of the political field. The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations  They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it  you can touch it  you can ever smell it. But a nation or a state  like Israel or Iran or France or Germany  this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today  perhaps  work for a corporation  like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things  They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. And what do corporations do all day  Mostly  they try to make money. Yet  what is money  Again  money is not an objective reality  it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper  the dollar bill. Look at it    it has no value. You cannot eat it  you cannot drink it  you cannot wear it. But then came along these master storytellers    the big bankers  the finance ministers  the prime ministers    and they tell us a very convincing story   Look  you see this green piece of paper  It is actually worth    bananas.  And if I believe it  and you believe it  and everybody believes it  it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper  go to the supermarket  give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before  and get  in exchange  real bananas which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade  of course   Yes  you give me a coconut  I'll give you a banana.  That can work. But  you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana  No way  What do you think I am  a human  Money  in fact  is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans  because it is the only story everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God  not everybody believes in human rights  not everybody believes in nationalism  but everybody believes in money  and in the dollar bill. Take  even  Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics and American religion and American culture  but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of them  actually. To conclude  then  We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live in an objective reality. Their reality consists of objective entities  like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. We humans  we also live in an objective reality. In our world  too  there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries  we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality  a reality made of fictional entities  like nations  like gods  like money  like corporations. And what is amazing is that as history unfolded  this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today  the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today  the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities  like the United States  like Google  like the World Bank    entities that exist only in our own imagination. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Yuval  you have a new book out. After Sapiens  you wrote another one  and it's out in Hebrew  but not yet translated into ... Yuval Noah Harari  I'm working on the translation as we speak. BG  In the book  if I understand it correctly  you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better  but they will create    and I quote you     ... new classes and new class struggles  just as the industrial revolution did.  Can you elaborate for us  YNH  Yes. In the industrial revolution  we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social history of the last     years involved what to do with this class  and the new problems and opportunities. Now  we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. As computers become better and better in more and more fields  there is a distinct possibility that computers will out perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant. And then the big political and economic question of the   st century will be   What do we need humans for    or at least   What do we need so many humans for   BG  Do you have an answer in the book  YNH  At present  the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future. BG  Ok  so you're basically saying in the book and now  that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality  we are just kind of at the beginning of the process  YNH  Again  it's not a prophecy  it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes  with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods  and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people. BG  I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. Thank you  Yuval  for making the trip. YNH  Thanks  For the past decade  I've been studying non state armed groups  armed organizations like terrorists  insurgents or militias. I document what these groups do when they're not shooting. My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation. I work in the field  in the policy world and in the library. Understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict  because war has changed. It used to be a contest between states. No longer. It is now a conflict between states and non state actors. For example  of the     peace agreements signed between      and           of them were between a state and a non state actor. So we need to understand these groups  we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful. So how do we do that  We need to know what makes these organizations tick. We know a lot about how they fight  why they fight  but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. Yet  armed struggle and unarmed politics are related. It is all part of the same organization. We cannot understand these groups  let alone defeat them  if we don't have the full picture. And armed groups today are complex organizations. Take the Lebanese Hezbollah  known for its violent confrontation against Israel. But since its creation in the early     s  Hezbollah has also set up a political party  a social service network  and a military apparatus. Similarly  the Palestinian Hamas  known for its suicide attacks against Israel  also runs the Gaza Strip since     . So these groups do way more than just shoot. They multi task. They set up complex communication machines    radio stations  TV channels  Internet websites and social media strategies. And up here  you have the ISIS magazine  printed in English and published to recruit. Armed groups also invest in complex fund raising    not looting  but setting up profitable businesses  for example  construction companies. Now  these activities are keys. They allow these groups to increase their strength  increase their funds  to better recruit and to build their brand. Armed groups also do something else  they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services. They build schools  they run hospitals  they set up vocational training programs or micro loan programs. Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing  safety and security. The initial rise of the Taliban in war torn Afghanistan  or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS  can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security. Now  unfortunately  in these cases  the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. But in general  providing social services fills a gap  a governance gap left by the government  and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power. For example  the      electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work. Now  this is a really complex picture  yet in the West  when we look at armed groups  we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength  strategy or long term vision. These groups are hybrid. They rise because they fill a gap left by the government  and they emerge to be both armed and political  engage in violent struggle and provide governance. And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated  the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state. Now  what do you call a group like Hezbollah  They run part of a territory  they administer all their functions  they pick up the garbage  they run the sewage system. Is this a state  Is it a rebel group  Or maybe something else  something different and new  And what about ISIS  The lines are blurred. We live in a world of states  non states  and in between  and the more states are weak  like in the Middle East today  the more non state actors step in and fill that gap. This matters for governments  because to counter these groups  they will have to invest more in non military tools. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding. If we better understand armed groups  we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence. So in this new contest between states and non states  military power can win some battles  but it will not give us peace nor stability. To achieve these objectives  what we need is a long term investment in filling that security gap  in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place. Thank you. Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name  a place with splendid vistas  a place where you can drive just    minutes and put your sailboat on the water. It's a seductive place  isn't it  I don't live there. But I did journey on a        mile trip for two years  to the fastest growing and whitest counties in America. What is a Whitopia  I define Whitopia in three ways  First  a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since     . Secondly  the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third  the Whitopia has an ineffable charm  a pleasant look and feel  a je Ne sais quoi. To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking  I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them  first  St. George  Utah  second  Coeur d'Alene  Idaho  and third  Forsyth County  Georgia. First stop  St. George    a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the     s  Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot  arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie  and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities  who I needed to meet  where I needed to be  and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings  I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George  I rented a home at the Entrada  one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel  's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident  and not like a visitor. I rented myself this home by phone. Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey  I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left  I was golfing at least three times a week. Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist  for example  invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members. I also went fishing. Because I had never fished  this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a     buy in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew  but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw  salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook  I hosted many dinner parties  and in return  people invited me to their dinner parties  and to their barbecues  and to their pool parties  and to their birthday parties. But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration  and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real time preview  and so it has become. Next stop  Almost Heaven  a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene  in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself  also by phone. The book  A Thousand Places To See Before You Die  lists Coeur d'Alene    it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen  boatmen and fishermen. My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In       around        families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest  for North Idaho  and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops  there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact  it is said  North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in  I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun  the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind  until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been. What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. In North Idaho  in my red pickup truck  I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho  I found Confederate flags on key chains  on cellphone paraphernalia  and on cars. About a seven minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations  the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries  the religious arm of Aryan Nations  happened to have a three day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. I'm the only non Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... ...is when Abe  an Aryan  sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee  and he said   Hey Rich  I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you  we just want to be away from you.  Indeed  most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists  in fact  they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather  they emigrate there for friendliness  comfort  security  safety    reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself. Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia  I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah  I found poker  in Idaho  I found guns  in Georgia  I found God. The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church  a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me  personally  I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say  in a Colorado  or an Idaho  or even a suburban Boston. That is because  there   in Georgia  white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. But what does it all mean  Whitopian dreaming  Whitopia migration  is a push pull phenomenon  full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls  and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons  though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals  social welfare abuse  minorities  density  crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit  freedom  the allure of privatism    privatized places  privatized people  privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations    how we treat each other as human beings    are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia    years ago  What a journey that would have been. And yet  some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in     . As Americans  we often find ways to cook for each other  to dance with each other  to host with each other  but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities  It's a devastating irony  how we have gone forward as individuals  and backwards as communities. One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying   One black man is a delightful dinner guest     black men is a ghetto.  One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year     . By       white people will no longer be the American majority. As such  will there be more Whitopias  In looking at this  the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have  the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. I ventured on my two year         mile journey to learn where  why  and how white people are fleeing  but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia    or a Blacktopia  for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. Thank you. There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says   Don't hate the media. Be the media.  I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because A  I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B  I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold. I remember watching  in       an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then US Defense Secretary  Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq  and Rumsfeld is asked the question   Well  we're hear about our body counts  but we never hear about theirs  why   And Rumsfeld's answer is   Well  we don't do body counts on other people.  Right  It's estimated that between         to one million Iraqis  civilians  have died as a result of the US led invasion in     . That number is in stark contrast with the       US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion. Monuments to war  such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial  are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world  and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school  my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told  if we wrote a really good letter  if we really thought about it  we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply. This is my  Notepad.  What looks like an everyday  yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion.  Notepad  is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper  when magnified  are revealed to be micro printed text that contains the details  the names  the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died. So  for the last   years  I've been taking pads of this paper  tons of this stuff  and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments. I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that. But also  I've been meeting one on one with members and former members of the so called Coalition of the Willing  who assisted in the invasion. And so  whenever I can  I meet with one of them  and I share the project with them. And last summer  I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author  Alberto Gonzales. This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of an ongoing art project. Alberto Gonzalez  This is a special legal pad  MK  Yes. You won't believe me  but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art  I'm an artist. MK  And all of the lines of the paper are actually    AG  Are they going to disappear  MK  No  they're micro printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq. AG  Yeah. OK. AG  Thank you. MK  Thank you. The way he says  thank you  really creeps me out. OK  so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter that's sent in to the government  and this is all across the world  of course    every letter that is sent in is archived  filed and recorded. Together  we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government  our shared historical record. Thank you. Tom Rielly  So  tell me Matt  how did this idea come into your head  of  Notepad   Matt Kenyon  I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the  Improvised Empathetic Device  which accumulated  in real time  the names  ranks  cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas  and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data  it would stab me in the arm. And so  I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas  but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties. TR  Thank you so much. MK  Thank you. What do you do when you have a headache  You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head  where the pain is  it goes through your stomach  intestines and various other organs first. Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside  though  is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem  particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti HIV drugs  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood  and increasing the CD  cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects  but mostly bad  because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood  and worse  by the time they get to the sites where it matters most  within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body    such as the lymph nodes  the nervous system  as well as the lungs    where the virus is sleeping  and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti HIV drugs therapy. However  upon discontinuation of therapy  the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood. Now  all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment  which is a life long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day  I sat and thought   Can we deliver anti HIV directly within its reservoir sites  without the risk of drug dilution   As a laser scientist  the answer was just before my eyes  Lasers  of course. If they can be used for dentistry  for diabetic wound healing and surgery  they can be used for anything imaginable  including transporting drugs into cells. As a matter of fact  we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes  which open and close almost immediately in HIV infected cells  in order to deliver drugs within them.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  we shine a very powerful but super tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell  while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it  the induced hole becomes immediately repaired. Now  we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes  but the goal is to get this technology in the human body  apply it in the human body.  How is that possible   you may ask. Well  the answer is  through a three headed device. Using the first head  which is our laser  we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head  which is a camera  we meander to the site of infection. Finally  using a third head  which is a drug spreading sprinkler  we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection  while the laser is again used to poke those cells open. Well  this might not seem like much right now. But one day  if successful  this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV. This is every HIV researcher's dream    in our case  a cure lead by lasers. Thank you. Today  I want to talk to you about dreams. I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life  and it's cooler than in the movies. Beyond flying  breathing fire  and making hot men spontaneously appear ... I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So  yeah. I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures  not words. To me  words are more like instincts and language. There are many people like me  Nikola Tesla  for example  who could visualize  design  test  and troubleshoot everything    all of his inventions    in his mind  accurately. Language is kind of exclusive to our species  anyway. I am a bit more primitive  like a beta version of Google Translate. My brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me. For example  once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. This can make basic communication a challenge  unless you need directions. Thank you. A few years ago  when I started doing presentations  I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. And I had no idea what she was talking about. She said   Do that thing  you know  with your eyes  when you're flirting with guys.   What thing   I asked.  You know  squint.  And so I tried  really. It looked something like this. I looked like I was searching for Waldo. There's a reason for this  as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. I have Asperger's  a high functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways  and growing up  I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes  but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert    and they taught me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say  I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles  and so for years  I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now  though. I had to do a lot to get here  and my parents    things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer  and on top of everything  it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel       miles across the country to get treatment  but within days of them prescribing a new medication  my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid  and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me. My family finally rescued me  but by that time  I had lost    pounds in those three weeks  as well as developing severe anemia  and was on the verge of suicide. I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions  my trauma  and my social anxiety  and they knew how to treat it  and I got the help I finally needed. And after    months of hard work  I went on to do incredible things. One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes  these people have a very complex inner life  and I know for myself  I have a very colorful personality  rich ideas  and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands  and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. Not many places would hire me  due to my lack of social skills  which is why I applied to Waffle House. Waffle House is an exceptional    hour diner    thank you    where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... Sliced  diced  peppered  chunked  topped  capped  and covered. As social norms would have it  you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. So one time  at   am  I was chatting with a waitress  and I asked her   What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job   And she told me that one time  a man walked in completely naked. I said   Great  Sign me up for the graveyard shift   Needless to say  Waffle House did not hire me. So in terms of having Asperger's  it can be viewed as a disadvantage  and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt  but it's also the opposite. It's a gift  and it allows me to think innovatively. At     I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs  and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity  presenting this research. Thank you. And at     I'm getting ready to graduate college  and I am a co founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. Thank you. But consider what I had to do to get here     therapists     misdiagnoses  and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way  and I think there is  autism assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder  or ASD. The app Podium  released by my company  AutismSees  has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this  it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public speaking and job interview experience. And so maybe one day  Waffle House will hire me  after practicing on it some more. And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today  and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD    it has been speculated that many innovative scientists  researchers  artists  and engineers have it  like  for example  Emily Dickinson  Jane Austen  Isaac Newton  and Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so  many people with autism are being overlooked every day  and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that  to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding. One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free  without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind  I am at peace. I am free from judgment  and so I can do whatever I want  you know  I'm making out with Brad Pitt  and Angelina is totally cool with it. But the goal of autism assistive technology is bigger than that  and more important. My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean  look at Temple Grandin  for example. And by doing so  we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward. In addition  we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world  in real time. Thank you. Thank you. Over the past    years  I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information. And I've noticed an interesting shift. For a long period of time  we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us  also known as the great chain of being  or  Scala naturae  in Latin  a top down structure that normally starts with God at the very top  followed by angels  noblemen  common people  animals  and so on. This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology  which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories  like the ones you see behind me. But over time  interestingly enough  this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree  also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge. The branching scheme of the tree was  in fact  such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became  over time  an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge. We can see trees being used to map morality  with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices  as you can see here  with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe. We can see trees being used to map consanguinity  the various blood ties between people. We can also see trees being used to map genealogy  perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram. I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees. Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way. We can see trees even mapping systems of law  the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers. And finally  of course  also a very popular scientific metaphor  we can see trees being used to map all species known to man. And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways  they really embody this human desire for order  for balance  for unity  for symmetry. However  nowadays we are really facing new complex  intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram. And a new metaphor is currently emerging  and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge. It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us. And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network. And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge. We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain. While before  we used to think of the brain as a modular  centralized organ  where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors  the more we know about the brain  the more we think of it as a large music symphony  played by hundreds and thousands of instruments. This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project  where you can see        neurons and    million connections. And this is only mapping    percent of a mammalian neocortex. We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge. These are some remarkable trees of knowledge  or trees of science  by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull. And Llull was actually the precursor  the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree  a metaphor we use every single day  when we say   Biology is a branch of science   when we say   Genetics is a branch of science.  But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge  at least for me  was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in     . This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment  and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia. And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree. But knowledge is much more intricate than this. These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter linkage of articles    related to history on the left  and mathematics on the right. And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia    arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man    we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent  just like a network. We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people. This is the typical organization chart. I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well  in your own corporations  or others. It's a top down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top  and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom. But humans sometimes are  well  actually  all humans are unique in their own way  and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure. I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot. This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers. Perl is a famous programming language  and here  you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files  and working together on a given project. And here  you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process    there's no leader in this organization  it's a network. We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism. One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized  independent cells  where there's no leader leading the whole process. And here  you can actually see how visualization is being used. The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in     . And what they did here is  they actually segmented the network into three different years  represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year. So even though there's no leader per se  these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization  the ones that know more about the past  and the future plans and goals of this particular cell. We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species. The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in  The Origin of Species   which Darwin called the  Tree of Life.  There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher  expanding on the importance of this particular diagram. It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution. But recently  scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria  and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before  to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life  but the web of life  the network of life. And finally  we can really see this shift  again  when we look at ecosystems around our planet. No more do we have these simplified predator versus prey diagrams we have all learned at school. This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem. This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne  mapping close to     species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. And I think here  we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet. But even though recent  this metaphor of the network  is really already adopting various shapes and forms  and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy. It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language. And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me. And these are actually    different typologies I've been collecting over time  and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor. And here is an example. On the very top band  you have radial convergence  a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years. At the top left  the very first project is a gene network  followed by a network of IP addresses    machines  servers    followed by a network of Facebook friends. You probably couldn't find more disparate topics  yet they are using the same metaphor  the same visual model  to map the never ending complexities of its own subject. And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting  of this growing visual taxonomy of networks. But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. As designers  researchers  and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems  they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields  like painting and sculpture  and influencing many different artists. And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them    they're immensely gorgeous    they are really becoming a cultural meme  and driving a new art movement  which I've called  networkism.  And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways. This is just one of many examples  where you can see this influence from science into art. The example on your left side is IP mapping  a computer generated map of IP addresses  again    servers  machines. And on your right side  you have  Transient Structures and Unstable Networks  by Sharon Molloy  using oil and enamel on canvas. And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy  some gorgeous  intricate paintings. And here's another example of that interesting cross pollination between science and art. On your left side  you have  Operation Smile.  It is a computer generated map of a social network. And on your right side  you have  Field     by Emma McNally  using only graphite on paper. Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement  and she creates these striking  imaginary landscapes  where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization. But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions. This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement. And I think the title really says it all    it's called   Galaxies Forming Along Filaments  Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web.  And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. It was created by Tom s Saraceno  and he occupies these large spaces  creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes. As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes  the entire network kind of shifts  almost like a real organic network would. And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level. This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called  In Silence.  And Chiharu  like Tom s Saraceno  fills these rooms with this dense network  this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread  sometimes including objects  as you can see here  sometimes even including people  in many of her installations. But networks are also not just a new trend  and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. Networks really embody notions of decentralization  of interconnectedness  of interdependence. And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays  from decoding the human brain  to understanding the vast universe out there. On your left side  you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse    very similar to our own at this particular scale. And on your right side  you have the Millennium Simulation. It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure. It was able to recreate the history of    million galaxies in approximately    terabytes of output. And coincidentally or not  I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge    the brain    and the largest scale of knowledge    the universe itself    to be really quite striking and fascinating. Because as Bruce Mau once said   When everything is connected to everything else  for better or for worse  everything matters.  Thank you so much. This is a painting from the   th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder. It shows the famous Fountain of Youth. If you drink its water or you bathe in it  you will get health and youth. Every culture  every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth. There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De Le n  the explorer  who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it  What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth  I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age related diseases in the future. It started with experiments that showed  in a recent number of studies about growing  that animals    old mice    that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated. This is similar to what you might see in humans  in Siamese twins  and I know this sounds a bit creepy. But what Tom Rando  a stem cell researcher  reported in       was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation. This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later  and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas  the liver and the heart. But what I'm most excited about  and several other labs as well  is that this may even apply to the brain. So  what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis  shows a younger brain    and a brain that functions better. And I repeat  an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain. So when we get older    we can look at different aspects of human cognition  and you can see on this slide here  we can look at reasoning  verbal ability and so forth. And up to around age    or     these functions are all intact  and as I look at the young audience here in the room  we're all still fine. But it's scary to see how all these curves go south. And as we get older  diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. We know that with age  the connections between neurons    the way neurons talk to each other  the synapses    they start to deteriorate  neurons die  the brain starts to shrink  and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases. One big problem we have    to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level    is that we can't study the brains in detail  in living people. We can do cognitive tests  we can do imaging    all kinds of sophisticated testing. But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease. This is what neuropathologists do  for example. So  how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism. Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body  So if the body ages or gets sick  does that affect the brain  And vice versa  as the brain gets older  does that influence the rest of the body  And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood. Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen  for example  the red blood cells  or fights infectious diseases  but it also carries messenger molecules  hormone like factors that transport information from one cell to another  from one tissue to another  including the brain. So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age  can we learn something about the brain  We know that as we get older  the blood changes as well  so these hormone like factors change as we get older. And by and large  factors that we know are required for the development of tissues  for the maintenance of tissues    they start to decrease as we get older  while factors involved in repair  in injury and in inflammation    they increase as we get older. So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors  if you will. And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that  I want to talk you through an experiment that we did. We had almost     blood samples from healthy human beings    to    years of age  and we measured over     of these communication factors  these hormone like proteins that transport information between tissues. And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group  about half the factors changed significantly. So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older  when it comes to these factors. And using statistical or bioinformatics programs  we could try to discover those factors that best predict age    in a way  back calculate the relative age of a person. And the way this looks is shown in this graph. So  on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived  the chronological age. So  how many years they lived. And then we take these top factors that I showed you  and we calculate their relative age  their biological age. And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation  so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers  as they so often are in life. You can see here  the person I highlighted with the green dot is about    years of age but seems to have a biological age  if what we're doing here is really true  of only about   . So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age  But more importantly  Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age related disease and will have a long life    will live to     or more  On the other hand  the person here  highlighted with the red dot  is not even     but has a biological age of   . Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age related disease  So in our lab  we're trying to understand these factors better  and many other groups are trying to understand  what are the true aging factors  and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age related diseases  So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational  right  You can just say   Well  these factors change with age   but you don't really know if they do something about aging. So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue. And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis. So  parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together  and that leads then to a shared blood system  where we can now ask   How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood   And for this purpose  we use young mice that are an equivalency of    year old people  and old mice that are roughly    years old in human years. What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses  the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories. And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals. So when we connect them  there are actually no cells going into the old brain  in this model. Instead  we've reasoned  then  that it must be the soluble factors  so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma  and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice  and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects  but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice. As mice get older  like us humans  they have memory problems. It's just harder to detect them  but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. But we wanted to take this one step further  one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans. What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies  where we used human plasma  young human plasma  and as a control  saline  and injected it into old mice  and asked  can we again rejuvenate these old mice  Can we make them smarter  And to do this  we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze. This is a big table that has lots of holes in it  and there are guide marks around it  and there's a bright light  as on this stage here. The mice hate this and they try to escape  and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow  where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. So we teach them  over several days  to find this space on these cues in the space  and you can compare this for humans  to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping. Many of us have probably had some problems with that. So  let's look at an old mouse here. This is an old mouse that has memory problems  as you'll notice in a moment. It just looks into every hole  but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. In stark contrast  this mouse here is a sibling of the same age  but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks  with small injections every three days. And as you noticed  it almost looks around   Where am I      and then walks straight to that hole and escapes. So  it could remember where that hole was. So by all means  this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated    it functions more like a younger mouse. And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma  but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain. So to summarize  we find the old mouse  and its brain in particular  are malleable. They're not set in stone  we can actually change them. It can be rejuvenated. Young blood factors can reverse aging  and what I didn't show you    in this model  the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old. So there are old blood factors that can accelerate aging. And most importantly  humans may have similar factors  because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect. Old human blood  I didn't show you  does not have this effect  it does not make the mice younger. So  is this magic transferable to humans  We're running a small clinical study at Stanford  where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers     year olds  and do this once a week for four weeks  and then we look at their brains with imaging. We test them cognitively  and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living. What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. And if that's the case  that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans. Now  I don't think we will live forever. But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us  and it has just dried out. And if we can turn it back on a little bit  maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects  we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging  such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Thank you very much. For more than     years  the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments. For much of this time  this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries  computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second  Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost. So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse  your children  a colleague or your doctor on the telephone  someone could be listening. Now  that someone might be your own government  it could also be another government  a foreign intelligence service  or a hacker  or a criminal  or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system  that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies. But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority  Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly  over the last couple years  Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult. For example  many of you might have an iPhone  and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone  those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact  according to Apple  they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise  if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones  that  too  cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp  which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world  also has built strong encryption technology into its product  which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments  often authoritarian  wiretapping their text messages. So  after     years of being able to listen to any telephone call    anytime  anywhere    you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact  that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters. In short  the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so  government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron  they believe that all communications    emails  texts  voice calls    all of these should be available to governments  and encryption is making that difficult. Now  look    I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world  and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor. But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop  or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted  then so can the rest of ours  too. And I think we really need to ask  Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly  So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described    this is not imaginary. In       the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks    the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police    those systems were compromised by the Chinese government  because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. By the same token  in       the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece    Greece's largest telephone company    was compromised by an unknown entity  and that feature  the surveillance feature  was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. And really  this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features  or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology  you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side  by good guys  or by bad guys. And so for that reason  I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes  this means that in the future  encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals  by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world. And so right now  you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets  you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are  or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are. And so  my message to you is this  We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones  I want you to tell your colleagues  Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy  but use them because they're secure. Thank you. I was raised by lesbians in the mountains  and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. Really messed with my head  but I'll get into that later. I'll start with when I was eight years old. I took a wood box  and I buried a dollar bill  a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in     years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas  maybe how we ate our spaghetti. I really didn't know. Anyway  this is kind of funny  because here I am     years later  and I'm still making boxes. Now  at some point I was in Hawaii    I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff  and I was making a collage for my ma. And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up  and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid  and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. Now  she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them  so I poured more resin on the canvas  thinking I could hide it or something. Instead  the opposite happened  It sort of created a magnification  like a magnifying glass  on the dictionary text. So what did I do  I built more boxes. This time  I started putting electronics  frogs  strange bottles I'd find in the street    anything I could find    because I was always finding things my whole life  and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. So I started drawing around the objects  and I realized  Holy moly  I can draw in space  I can make free floating lines  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. So I took the objects out  and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. First  botanical    which you can kind of get a sense of. Then I made some weird insects and creatures. It was really fun  I was just drawing on the layers of resin. And it was cool  because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff  I was making some money  I could take my girlfriend for dinner  and like  go to Sizzler. It was some good shit  man. At some point  I got up to the human form  life size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. This was great  except for one thing  I was going to die. I didn't know what to do  because the resin was going to kill me. And I went to bed every night thinking about it. So I tried using glass. I started drawing on the layers of glass  almost like if you drew on a window  then you put another window  and another window  and you had all these windows together that made a three dimensional composition. And this really worked  because I could stop using the resin. So I did this for years  which culminated in a very large work  which I call  The Triptych.   The Triptych  was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's   The  Garden of Earthly Delights   which is a painting in the  Museo del  Prado in Spain. Do you guys know this painting  Good  it's a cool painting. It's kind of ahead of its time  they say. So   The Triptych.  I'll walk you through this piece. It weighs        pounds. It's    feet long. It's double sided  so it's    feet of composition. It's kind of weird. Well  that's the blood fountain. To the left  you have Jesus and the locusts. There's a cave where all these animal headed creatures travel between two worlds. They go from the representational world  to this analog mesh underworld  where they're hiding. This is where the animal headed creatures are by the lighthouse  and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. Billy Graham is in the ocean  the Horizon from the oil spill  Waldo  Osama Bin Laden's shelter    there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard  in the ocean. Anyway  this is a lady creature. She's coming out of the ocean  and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. Her hands are like scales  and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance. So that's one side of  The Triptych.  It's a little narrative thing. That's her hand that she's spitting into. And then  when you go to the other side  she has like a trunk  like a bird's beak  and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. Then she has an    foot long serpent's tail that connects  The Triptych.  Anyway  her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. I don't know why that happened. That happens  you know. Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball  made out of      terrorist cards. Have you guys seen those  They were made in the     's  they're like baseball cards of terrorists. Way ahead of their time. That will bring you to my latest project. I'm in the middle of two projects  One's called  Psychogeographies.  It's about a six year project to make     of these humans. Each one is an archive of our culture  through our ripped up media and matter  whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human  and they travel in groups of        or    at a time. They're like cells    they come together  they divide. And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. Each one is basically a       pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside. This one has a little cave in his chest. That's his head  there's the chest  you can kind of see the beginning. I'm going to go down the body for you  There's a waterfall coming out of his chest  covering his penis    or not penis  or whatever it is  a kind of androgynous thing. I'll take you quickly through these works  because I can't explain them for too long. There are the layers  you can kind of see it. That's a body getting split in half. This one has two heads  and it's communicating between the two heads. You can see the pills coming out  going into one head from this weird statue. There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. Can you see that  Anyway  this talk's all about these boxes  like the boxes we're in. This box we're in  the solar system is a box. This brings you to my latest box. It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works. Inside of this box is a physicist  a neuroscientist  a painter  a musician  a writer  a radio station  a museum  a school  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world  a garden. We shake this box up  and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles. And I think that's the way you change the world. You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. And you come together to realize that we're all in this together  that this delusion of difference    this idea of countries  of borders  of religion    doesn't work. We're all really made up of the same stuff  in the same box. And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely  we're all going to die real soon. Thank you very much. I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science  one that is still speculative but hugely exciting  and certainly one that's growing very rapidly. Quantum biology asks a very simple question  Does quantum mechanics    that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry    also play a role inside the living cell  In other words  Are there processes  mechanisms  phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics  Now  quantum biology isn't new  it's been around since the early     s. But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments    in biochemistry labs  using spectroscopy    have shown very clear  firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them. Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists  biochemists  molecular biologists    it's a very interdisciplinary field. I come from quantum physics  so I'm a nuclear physicist. I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics. One of the founders of quantum mechanics  Niels Bohr  said  If you're not astonished by it  then you haven't understood it. So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. That's a good thing. But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe    the building blocks of reality. If we think about the scale of size  start with an everyday object like the tennis ball  and just go down orders of magnitude in size    from the eye of a needle down to a cell  down to a bacterium  down to an enzyme    you eventually reach the nano world. Now  nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. My area is the atomic nucleus  which is the tiny dot inside an atom. It's even smaller in scale. This is the domain of quantum mechanics  and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it. Biologists  on the other hand  have got off lightly  in my view. They are very happy with their balls and sticks models of molecules. The balls are the atoms  the sticks are the bonds between the atoms. And when they can't build them physically in the lab  nowadays  they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule. This is a protein made up of         atoms. It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it. Quantum mechanics was developed in the     s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small. And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world  made up of trillions of atoms. It's a world built on probability and chance. It's a fuzzy world. It's a world of phantoms  where particles can also behave like spread out waves. If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics  then  as the fundamental foundation of reality itself  then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry. After all  it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry  scaled up in complexity  gives us molecular biology  which of course leads to life itself. So in a way  it's sort of not surprising. It's almost trivial. You say   Well  of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics.  But so does everything else. So does all inanimate matter  made up of trillions of atoms. Ultimately  there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness. But in everyday life  we can forget about it. Because once you put together trillions of atoms  that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology isn't about this. Quantum biology isn't this obvious. Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level. Quantum biology is about looking for the non trivial    the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics    and to see if they do  indeed  play an important role in describing the processes of life. Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world. This is the quantum skier. He seems to be intact  he seems to be perfectly healthy  and yet  he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time. Well  if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt  of course. But in the quantum world  this happens all the time. Particles can multitask  they can be in two places at once. They can do more than one thing at the same time. Particles can behave like spread out waves. It's almost like magic. Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness. I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics. You see  this weirdness is very delicate  and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. We cool our system down to near absolute zero  we carry out our experiments in vacuums  we try and isolate it from any external disturbance. That's very different from the warm  messy  noisy environment of a living cell. Biology itself  if you think of molecular biology  seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry    chemical reactions. And these are reductionist  deterministic chemical reactions  showing that  essentially  life is made of the same stuff as everything else  and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world  then we should be able to forget about it in biology  as well. Well  one man begged to differ with this idea. Erwin Schr dinger  of Schr dinger's Cat fame  was an Austrian physicist. He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the     s. In       he wrote a book called  What is Life   It was tremendously influential. It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson  the discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA. To paraphrase a description in the book  he says  At the molecular level  living organisms have a certain order  a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity. In fact  living matter seems to behave in this order  in a structure  just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero  where quantum effects play a very important role. There's something special about the structure    the order    inside a living cell. So  Schr dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life. It's a very speculative  far reaching idea  and it didn't really go very far. But as I mentioned at the start  in the last    years  there have been experiments emerging  showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics. I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. This is one of the best known phenomena in the quantum world  quantum tunneling. The box on the left shows the wavelike  spread out distribution of a quantum entity    a particle  like an electron  which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall  like a phantom leaping through to the other side. You can see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box. Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier  and yet somehow  as though by magic  disappear from one side and reappear on the other. The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall  you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall. In the quantum world  you don't have to throw it over the wall  you can throw it at the wall  and there's a certain non zero probability that it'll disappear on your side  and reappear on the other. This isn't speculation  by the way. We're happy    well   happy  is not the right word    we are familiar with this. Quantum tunneling takes place all the time  in fact  it's the reason our Sun shines. The particles fuse together  and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling. Back in the   s and   s  it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells. Enzymes  those workhorses of life  the catalysts of chemical reactions    enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells  by many  many orders of magnitude. And it's always been a mystery how they do this. Well  it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of  is by transferring subatomic particles  like electrons and indeed protons  from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. It's efficient  it's fast  it can disappear    a proton can disappear from one place  and reappear on the other. Enzymes help this take place. This is research that's been carried out back in the   s  particularly by a group in Berkeley  Judith Klinman. Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this. Research carried out by my group    so as I mentioned  I'm a nuclear physicist  but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei  and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA. Again  this is not a new idea  it goes all the way back to the early   s. The two strands of DNA  the double helix structure  are held together by rungs  it's like a twisted ladder. And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds    protons  that act as the glue between the two strands. So if you zoom in  what they're doing is holding these large molecules    nucleotides    together. Zoom in a bit more. So  this a computer simulation. The two white balls in the middle are protons  and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. One prefers to sit on one side  the other  on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down  which you can't see. It can happen that these two protons can hop over. Watch the two white balls. They can jump over to the other side. If the two strands of DNA then separate  leading to the process of replication  and the two protons are in the wrong positions  this can lead to a mutation. This has been known for half a century. The question is  How likely are they to do that  and if they do  how do they do it  Do they jump across  like the ball going over the wall  Or can they quantum tunnel across  even if they don't have enough energy  Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here. We still don't know yet how important it is  this is still an open question. It's speculative  but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations  surely this must have big implications  to understand certain types of mutations  possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous. Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence  in one of the most important processes in biology  photosynthesis  plants and bacteria taking sunlight  and using that energy to create biomass. Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It's the quantum skier. It's an object that behaves like a wave  so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other  but can follow multiple pathways at the same time. Some years ago  the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria  carrying out photosynthesis. The idea is that the photon  the particle of light  the sunlight  the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule  is then delivered to what's called the reaction center  where it can be turned into chemical energy. And in getting there  it doesn't just follow one route  it follows multiple pathways at once  to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. A remarkable idea  and yet evidence is growing almost weekly  with new papers coming out  confirming that this does indeed take place. My third and final example is the most beautiful  wonderful idea. It's also still very speculative  but I have to share it with you. The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean  every autumn  and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects  they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Now  the Earth's magnetic field is very  very weak  it's     times weaker than a fridge magnet  and yet it affects the chemistry    somehow    within a living organism. That's not in doubt    a German couple of ornithologists  Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko  in the     s  confirmed that indeed  the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field  to give it directional information    a built in compass. The puzzle  the mystery was  How does it do it  Well  the only theory in town    we don't know if it's the correct theory  but the only theory in town    is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement. Inside the robin's retina    I kid you not    inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome  which is light sensitive. Within cryptochrome  a pair of electrons are quantum entangled. Now  quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart  and yet somehow remain in contact with each other. Even Einstein hated this idea  he called it  spooky action at a distance.  So if Einstein doesn't like it  then we can all be uncomfortable with it. Two quantum entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field. We don't know if it's the correct explanation  but wow  wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate  Quantum biology is still in it infancy. It's still speculative. But I believe it's built on solid science. I also think that in the coming decade or so  we're going to start to see that actually  it pervades life    that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world. Watch this space. Thank you. The child's symptoms begin with mild fever  headache  muscle pains  followed by vomiting and diarrhea  then bleeding from the mouth  nose and gums. Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure. Sounds familiar  If you're thinking this is Ebola  actually  in this case  it's not. It's an extreme form of dengue fever  a mosquito born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine  and kills        people each year. That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it. As for measles  so much in the news recently  the death toll is actually tenfold higher. Yet for the last year  it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear. Clearly  there is something deeply rooted about it  something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases. But what is it  exactly  Well  it's hard to acquire Ebola  but if you do  the risk of a horrible death is high. Why  Because right now  we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available. And so  that's the clue. We may have it someday. So we rightfully fear Ebola  because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases. In fact  it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles. We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola. Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science. But wait a second  why is that  We've known about Ebola since     . We've known what it's capable of. We've had ample opportunity to study it in the    outbreaks that have occurred. And in fact  we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade. Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now  This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases. It goes something like this  The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines. This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines  unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries. It's simply too commercially risky. As for Ebola  there is absolutely no market at all  so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now  is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. Ebola was relatively ignored until September    and the anthrax attacks  when all of a sudden  people perceived Ebola as  potentially  a bioterrorism weapon. Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point  Well  partially  because it was really difficult    or thought to be difficult    to weaponize the virus  but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it. And this is really the point. The sad reality is  we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people  but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines. Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine. Fortunately for diseases like Ebola  there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case  if we want vaccines  we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us. By creating capabilities within countries  we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens. The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity  which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically  and what type of reactions they promote. So these are the things that can be done  but to do this  if we want to deal with a complete market failure  we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases. We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one. So  for Ebola  the paranoid fear of an infectious disease  followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries  led the global community to come together  and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies  we now have these  Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries    and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind. Every year  we spend billions of dollars  keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen. And yet  we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases. And make no mistake about it    it's not a question of  if   but  when.  These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world. And vaccines are our best defense. So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola  we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation. And we need to view this  then  as the ultimate deterrent    something we make sure is available  but at the same time  praying we never have to use it. Thank you. Over a million people are killed each year in disasters. Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced  and the communities will take    to    years to recover and billions of economic losses. If you can reduce the initial response by one day  you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days  or three years. See how that works  If the initial responders can get in  save lives  mitigate whatever flooding danger there is  that means the other groups can get in to restore the water  the roads  the electricity  which means then the construction people  the insurance agents  all of them can get in to rebuild the houses  which then means you can restore the economy  and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster. A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier  it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired. And that's why I do disaster robotics    because robots can make a disaster go away faster. Now  you've already seen a couple of these. These are the UAVs. These are two types of UAVs  a rotorcraft  or hummingbird  a fixed wing  a hawk. And they're used extensively since         Hurricane Katrina. Let me show you how this hummingbird  this rotorcraft  works. Fantastic for structural engineers. Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image  or anything flying at a higher angle. But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. You've got things like this fixed wing  this hawk. Now  this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys. That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting  D reconstruction. We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State  because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster    not the search and rescue. The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing. The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders. And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage  it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State. So they needed to understand what was going on. In seven hours  going from Arlington  driving from the Incident Command Post to the site  flying the UAVs  processing the data  driving back to Arlington command post    seven hours. We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way    and at higher resolution. It's a game changer. And don't just think about the UAVs. I mean  they are sexy    but remember     percent of the world's population lives by water  and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater    the parts that we can't get to  like the bridges and things like that. And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles  one type of which you've already met  which is SARbot  a square dolphin. It goes underwater and uses sonar. Well  why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very  very important  They get overlooked. Think about the Japanese tsunami        miles of coastland totally devastated  twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. You're talking about your bridges  your pipelines  your ports    wiped out. And if you don't have a port  you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population. That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake. So we need marine vehicles. Now  let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing. We were working on a fishing port. We were able to reopen that fishing port  using her sonar  in four hours. That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in  and it was going to take the divers two weeks. They were going to miss the fall fishing season  which was the major economy for that part  which is kind of like their Cape Cod. UMVs  very important. But you know  all the robots I've shown you have been small  and that's because robots don't do things that people do. They go places people can't go. And a great example of that is Bujold. Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small  so Bujold    Say hello to Bujold. Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers      and  . You're climbing into the rubble  rappelling down  going deep in spaces. And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint  look at this. You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog    and it's on fire. The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement  you have to go through things that are on fire. It was so hot  on one of the robots  the tracks began to melt and come off. Robots don't replace people or dogs  or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins. They do things new. They assist the responders  the experts  in new and innovative ways. The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller  though. It's not making them more heat resistant. It's not making more sensors. The biggest problem is the data  the informatics  because these people need to get the right data at the right time. So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site  so whoever's there  use their robots over the Internet. Well  let's think about that. Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county. What are the odds that the experts  your chemical engineer  your railroad transportation engineers  have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have  Probably  like  none. So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using  or even if they're using a robot or not. What the robots give you  what they give the experts  is data. The problem becomes  who gets what data when  One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out. Well  the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks  and worse yet  it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. So we need to think about those kinds of challenges. So it's the data. Going back to the World Trade Center  we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble  because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved  needed the data as we recorded the box beams  the serial numbers  the locations  as we went into the rubble. We lost valuable data. So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people. Now  here's another reason. We've learned that some buildings    things like schools  hospitals  city halls    get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases. Now  we're looking  if we can get the data from the robots to share  not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time  but now we can begin to do the response in parallel. Everybody can see the data. We can shorten it that way. So really   disaster robotics  is a misnomer. It's not about the robots. It's about the data. So my challenge to you  the next time you hear about a disaster  look for the robots. They may be underground  they may be underwater  they may be in the sky  but they should be there. Look for the robots  because robots are coming to the rescue. Paul Krugman  the Nobel Prize  winner  in economics  once wrote   Productivity is not everything  but in the long run  it is almost everything.  So this is serious. There are not that many things on earth that are  almost everything.  Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. So we have a problem. In the largest European economies  productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '  s  '  s  early '  s. From '   to '    three percent per annum. From '   to '    two percent per annum. Since       less than one percent per annum. The same profile in Japan. The same profile in the US  despite a momentary rebound    years ago  and despite all the technological innovations around us  the Internet  the information  the new information and communication technologies. When productivity grows three percent per annum  you double the standard of living every generation. Every generation is twice as well off as its parents'. When it grows one percent per annum  it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process  many people will be less well off than their parents. They will have less of everything  smaller roofs  or perhaps no roof at all  less access to education  to vitamins  to antibiotics  to vaccination    to everything. Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment. All. Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis. Why this crisis  Because the basic tenets about efficiency    effectiveness in organizations  in management    have become counterproductive for human efforts. Everywhere in public services    in companies  in the way we work  the way we innovate  invest    try to learn to work better. Take the holy trinity of efficiency  clarity  measurement  accountability. They make human efforts derail. There are two ways to look at it  to prove it. One  the one I prefer  is rigorous  elegant  nice    math. But the full math version takes a little while  so there is another one. It is to look at a relay race. This is what we will do today. It's a bit more animated  more visual and also faster    it's a race. Hopefully  it's faster. World championship final    women. Eight teams in the final. The fastest team is the US team. They have the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. Notably  if you compare them to an average team  say  the French team  based on their best performances in the     meter race  if you add the individual times of the US runners  they arrive at the finish line  .  meters ahead of the French team. And this year  the US team is in great shape. Based on their best performance this year  they arrive  .  meters ahead of the French team  based on the data. We are going to look at the race. At some point you will see  towards the end  that Torri Edwards  the fourth US runner  is ahead. Not surprising    this year she got the gold medal in the     meter race. And by the way  Chryste Gaines  the second runner in the US team  is the fastest woman on earth. So  there are  .  billion women on earth. Where are the two fastest  On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad  either. So clearly  the US team has won the war for talent. But behind  the average team is trying to catch up. Let's watch the race. Yves Morieux  So what happened  The fastest team did not win  the slower one did. By the way  I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good. But let's not exaggerate    it's not archeology  either. But why  Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence   Thanks to cooperation  the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts.  This is not poetry  this is not philosophy. This is math. Those who carry the baton are slower  but their baton is faster. Miracle of cooperation  it multiplies energy  intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts  how we work together  how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation  we can do more with less. Now  what happens to cooperation when the holy grail    the holy trinity  even    of clarity  measurement  accountability    appears  Clarity. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. Compliance audits  consultants' diagnostics. We need more clarity  we need to clarify the roles  the processes. It is as though the runners on the team were saying   Let's be clear    where does my role really start and end  Am I supposed to run for    meters        ...   It's important  let's be clear. If you say     after    meters  people will drop the baton  whether there is someone to take it or not. Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process  We need somebody accountable for this process. So in the relay race  since passing the baton is so important  then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton. So between each runner  now we will have a new dedicated athlete  clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner  and passing it to the next runner. And we will have at least two like that. Well  will we  in that case  win the race  That I don't know  but for sure  we would have a clear interface  a clear line of accountability. We will know who to blame. But we'll never win the race. If you think about it  we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail  than to creating the conditions to succeed. All the human intelligence put in organization design    urban structures  processing systems    what is the real goal  To have somebody guilty in case they fail. We are creating organizations able to fail  but in a compliant way  with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. And we are quite effective at that    failing. Measurement. What gets measured gets done. Look  to pass the baton  you have to do it at the right time  in the right hand  at the right speed. But to do that  you have to put energy in your arm. This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs. It will come at the expense of your measurable speed. You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton  to signal that you are arriving  so that the next runner can prepare  can anticipate. And you have to shout loud. But the blood  the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs. Because you know  there are eight people shouting at the same time. So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. You cannot say   Is it you   Too late  Now  let's look at the race in slow motion  and concentrate on the third runner. Look at where she allocates her efforts  her energy  her attention. Not all in her legs    that would be great for her own speed    but in also in her throat  arm  eye  brain. That makes a difference in whose legs  In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super fast  is it because she made a super effort  or because of the way the third runner passed the baton  There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance  they will put their energy  their attention  their blood in what can get measured    in their legs. And the baton will fall and slow down. To cooperate is not a super effort  it is how you allocate your effort. It is to take a risk  because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. It is to make a super difference in the performance of others  with whom we are compared. It takes being stupid to cooperate  then. And people are not stupid  they don't cooperate. You know  clarity  accountability  measurement were OK when the world was simpler. But business has become much more complex. With my teams  we have measured the evolution of complexity in business. It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers  to build advantage on a global scale  to create value. And the more business gets complex  the more  in the name of clarity  accountability  measurement we multiply structures  processes  systems. You know  this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces  middle offices  coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources  but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization  the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries  proxies  reports  key performance indicators  metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured  at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates  we add even more structure  process  systems. People spend their time in meetings  writing reports they have to do  undo and redo. Based on our analysis  teams in these organizations spend between    and    percent of their time wasting their time  but working harder and harder  longer and longer  on less and less value adding activities. This is what is killing productivity  what makes people suffer at work. Our organizations are wasting human intelligence. They have turned against human efforts. When people don't cooperate  don't blame their mindsets  their mentalities  their personality    look at the work situations. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not  if  when they cooperate  they are individually worse off  Why would they cooperate  When we blame personalities instead of the clarity  the accountability  the measurement  we add injustice to ineffectiveness. We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate. Remove the interfaces  the middle offices    all these complicated coordination structures. Don't look for clarity  go for fuzziness. Fuzziness overlaps. Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the  what.  Look at cooperation  the  how.  How did you pass the baton  Did you throw it  or did you pass it effectively  Am I putting my energy in what can get measured    my legs  my speed    or in passing the baton  You  as leaders  as managers  are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate  The future of our organizations  our companies  our societies hinges on your answer to these questions. Thank you. When I was    years old  I was interested in science    fascinated by it  excited to learn about it. And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class   The girls don't have to listen to this.  Encouraging  yes. I chose not to listen    but to that statement alone. So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile      kilometers      miles northeast of Santiago. It's very remote  it's very dry and it's very beautiful. And there's not much there. There are condors  there are tarantulas  and at night  when the light dims  it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place  the mountain. It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology. And our ancestors  for as long as there's been recorded history  have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence. And we're no exception  our generation. The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights. And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopes are our window to the cosmos. It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the   st century. We have an array of existing telescopes already  in the Andes mountains in Chile  and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability. There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes  sensitive to optical radiation  as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights. There will be radio telescopes  sensitive to long wavelength radio radiation. And then there will be telescopes in space. There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope  it's called the James Webb Telescope  and it will be launched in     . There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system. For the last decade  I've been leading a group    a consortium    international group  to build what will be  when it's finished  the largest optical telescope in existence. It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope  or GMT. This telescope is going to have mirrors that are  .  meters in diameter    each of the mirrors. That's almost    feet. So it dwarfs this stage    maybe out to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost    feet in diameter. Together  the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise    feet in diameter. So  essentially the size of this entire auditorium. The whole telescope will stand about    meters high  and again  being in Rio  some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height  in fact  it's smaller than this telescope will be. It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's    stories       meters high. But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. It will have open windows to the sky  be able to point and look at the sky  and it will actually rotate on a base          tons of rotating building. The Giant Magellan Telescope will have    times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be    million times more sensitive than the human eye. And it may  for the first time ever  be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe    literally  the dawn of the cosmos. The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back  witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling  the first black holes in the universe  the first galaxies. Now  for thousands of years  we have been studying the cosmos  we've been wondering about our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago  Copernicus displaced the Earth  and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries  since Galileo Galilei  the Italian scientist  first turned  in that time  a two inch  very small telescope  to the sky  every time we have built larger telescopes  we have learned something about the universe  we've made discoveries  without exception. We've learned in the   th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universe is made of about     billion galaxies that are visible to us  and each one of those galaxies has     billion stars within it. So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope  and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky  before the launch of Hubble. And if you can imagine this tiny area  it's only one fiftieth of the size of the full moon. So  if you can imagine the full moon. And there are now        galaxies visible within that image. And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away  the vast distances. And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines. So the farther back we look in space  the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets    literally  they collect light. So larger the bucket  the larger the mirror we have  the more light we can see  and the farther back we can view. So  we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe    black holes. We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter. You got it. Not all audiences get that. So the way we infer the presence of dark matter    we can't see it    but there's an unmistakable tug  due to gravity. We now can look out  we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding. What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe  and one of the projects that I carried out in the     s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding. We can now trace back to    billion years. We've learned over time that stars have individual histories  that is  they have birth  they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see  most of which turn out to have planets going around them. And one of the really surprising results in the last    years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. These are called exoplanets. And until       we didn't even know the existence of any other planets  other than going around our own sun. But now  there are almost       other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect  measure masses for. There are     of those that are multiple planet systems. And there are          and still counting    other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds. There are Jupiter like planets that are hot  there are other planets that are icy  there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth  so called  super Earths   and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds. So we know there's at least one planet  our own Earth  in which there is life. We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the province of science fiction. So around our own planet  we know there's life  we've developed a complex life  we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered  the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions  perhaps    maybe even hundreds of millions    of other  planets  that are close enough    just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting    to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. So we marvel now at those odds  the overwhelming odds  and the amazing thing is that within the next decade  the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets  and determine whether or not they have the potential for life. So  what is the GMT project  It's an international project. It includes Australia  South Korea  and I'm happy to say  being here in Rio  that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil. It also includes a number of institutions across the United States  including Harvard University  the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions  and the Universities of Arizona  Chicago  Texas Austin and Texas A M University. It also involves Chile. So  the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. Take chunks of glass  melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. It's tucked away under        seats. Nobody know it's happening. And there's essentially a rotating cauldron. The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly  and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. And so  if you think about the precision of these mirrors  the bumps on the mirror  over the entire    feet  amount to less than one millionth of an inch. So  can you visualize that  Ow  That's one five thousandths of the width of one of my hairs  over this entire    feet. It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have. So  what does that precision buy us  So the GMT  if you can imagine    if I were to hold up a coin  which I just happen to have  and I look at the face of that coin  I can see from here the writing on the coin  I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row  you can't see that. But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope  all    feet diameter that we see in this auditorium  and point it     miles away  if I were standing in S o Paulo  we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope. And if we were    If an astronaut went up to the Moon  a quarter of a million miles away  and lit a candle    a single candle    then we would be able to detect it  using the GMT. Quite extraordinary. This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.  Nearby  is astronomical  it's all relative. It's tens of millions of light years away. This is what this cluster would look like. So look at those four bright objects  and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detail that starts to come through. And now finally    and look how dramatic this is    this is what the GMT will see. So  keep your eyes on those bright images again. This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth  and this  again  what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision. So  where are we  We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off. We've tested and polished the first mirror. We've cast the second and the third mirrors. And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year  international panels that came in and reviewed us  and said   You're ready to go to construction.  And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors. We want to get on the air quickly  and be taking science data    what we astronomers call  first light   in     . And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade  with all seven mirrors. So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe  the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail. But for me  one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about    that we can't even imagine at this point  something completely new. And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities  that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars. Thank you very much. Obrigado. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Wendy. Stay with me  because I have a question for you. You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up  but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere  including in Hawaii. Is it about cooperation and complementarity  or about competition  I know there's competition in terms of funding  but what about the science  Wendy Freedman  In terms of the science  they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space  the telescopes on the ground  telescopes with different wavelength capability  telescopes even that are similar  but different instruments    they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. So when we discover other planets  we'll be able to test those observations  we'll be able to measure the atmospheres  be able to look in space with very high resolution. So  they're very complementary. You're right about the funding  we compete  but scientifically  it's very complementary. BG  Wendy  thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal. WF  Thank you. I will always remember the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform. I was eight at the time  living in the village with my grandmother  who was raising me and other children. Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe  and we just didn't have enough to eat. We were hungry. And that's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children. As she handed me my porridge  I asked her why she was there  and without hesitation  she said   As Africans  we must uplift all the people of Africa.  I had absolutely no idea what she meant. But her words stuck with me. Two years later  famine hit my country for the second time. My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before. So at the age of     I found myself in school for the very first time. And there  at the city school  I would experience what it was to be unequal. You see  in the village  we were all equal. But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids  I was not their equal. I couldn't speak English  and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing. But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex. Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family. Suddenly  I had much more than the rest of my village. And in their eyes  I was no longer their equal. I felt guilty. But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform  and I remember thinking   That's who I want to be    someone like her  someone who uplifts other people.  This childhood experience led me to the United Nations  and to my current role with UN Women  where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world's population    women and girls. Today  I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together. Eight months ago  under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka  head of UN Women  we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe  inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women  to create a shared vision for gender equality. This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men  and those who don't yet know that they believe. The initiative is based on a simple idea  that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us. We all feel the same things. We all want the same things  even when those things sometimes remain unspoken. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us  women and men together. It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality. Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half. Now imagine that women are represented here  and men are represented here. In our current population  HeForShe is about moving the  .  billion men  one man at a time  across that line  so that ultimately  men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history  making gender equality a reality in the   st century. However  engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial. Why invite men  They are the problem. In fact  men don't care  we were told. But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe. In just three days  more than         men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality. Within that first week  at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted  and within that same week  HeForShe created more than  .  billion conversations on social media. And that's when the emails started pouring in  sometimes as many as a thousand a day. We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe  who  after hearing about HeForShe  created a  husband school.  He literally went around his village  hand picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners  and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers. In Pune  India  a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally  mobilizing     cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community. In another impact story  a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community. He wrote   Dear Madam  I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife. Two weeks ago  I was listening to my radio  and your voice came on  and you spoke about something called the HeForShe  and the need for men to play their role. Within a few hours  I heard the woman cry again next door  but for the first time  I didn't just sit there. I felt compelled to do something  so I went over and I confronted the husband. Madam  it has been two weeks  and the woman has not cried since. Thank you for giving me a voice.  Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men  but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause. We want concrete  systematic  structural change that can equalize the political  economic and social realities for women and men. We are asking men to make concrete actions  calling them to intervene at a personal level  to change their behavior. We are calling upon governments  businesses  universities  to change their policies. We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions. Already  a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments. In a few early success stories  a leading French hospitality company  Accor  has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its         employees by     . The government of Sweden  under its current feminist government  has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term. In Japan  the University of Nagoya is building  as part of their HeForShe commitments  what will become one of Japan's leading gender research centers. Now  eight months later  a movement is building. We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life  and from every single corner in the world  from the United Nations' own Secretary General Ban Ki moon to the Secretary Generals of NATO and the EU Council  from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone. In Europe alone  all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe. In fact  one in    men in Iceland has joined the movement. The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador  Emma Watson  has garnered more than five billion media impressions  mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations. Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see. Einstein once said   A human being is part of the whole ... but he experiences himself  his thoughts and feelings  as something separate from the rest ... This delusion is a kind of prison for us ... Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion.  If women and men are part of a greater whole  as Einstein suggests  it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us  but ultimately  our shared humanity. HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams  the dreams that we have for ourselves  and the dreams that we have for our families  our children  friends  communities. So that's what it is about. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together. Thank you. If you want to buy high quality  low price cocaine  there really is only one place to go  and that is the dark net anonymous markets. Now  you can't get to these sites with a normal browser    Chrome or Firefox    because they're on this hidden part of the Internet  known as Tor hidden services  where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion  and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser. Now  the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project. It then became open source  and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location. And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. You can use it on the normal Internet  but it's also your key to the dark net. And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system  the    or       we don't know exactly    thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down. It is a censorship free world visited by anonymous users. Little wonder  then  that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide  and that something  of course  need not be illegal. On the dark net  you will find whistle blower sites  The New Yorker. You will find political activism blogs. You will find libraries of pirated books. But you'll also find the drugs markets  illegal pornography  commercial hacking services  and much more besides. Now  the dark net is one of the most interesting  exciting places anywhere on the net. And the reason is  because although innovation  of course  takes place in big businesses  takes place in world class universities  it also takes place in the fringes  because those on the fringes    the pariahs  the outcasts    they're often the most creative  because they have to be. In this part of the Internet  you will not find a single lolcat  a single pop up advert anywhere. And that's one of the reasons why I think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon. Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics. But let's say for a moment that you were. Bear with me. The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks. Every single product    thousands of products    has a glossy  high res image  a detailed product description  a price. There's a  Proceed to checkout  icon. There is even  most beautifully of all  a  Report this item  button. Incredible. You browse through the site  you make your choice  you pay with the crypto currency bitcoin  you enter an address     preferably not your home address    and you wait for your product to arrive in the post  which it nearly always does. And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption. That's important. Something far simpler than that. It's the user reviews. You see  every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym  naturally enough  but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation. And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want  the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site. And this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists would predict. Prices tend to go down  product quality tends to go up  and the vendors are attentive  they're polite  they're consumer centric  offering you all manner of special deals  one offs  buy one get one frees  free delivery  to keep you happy. I spoke to Drugsheaven. Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price. He had a very generous refund policy  detailed T's and C's  and good shipping times.  Dear Drugsheaven   I wrote  via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted  of course.  I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana   A couple of hours later  I get a reply. They always reply.  Hi there  thanks for your email. Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would  too  if I were you.   So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. I do hope we can do business together. Best wishes  Drugsheaven.  I don't know why he had a posh English accent  but I assume he did. Now  this kind of consumer centric attitude is the reason why  when I reviewed         pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period     percent of them were five out of five. The customer  you see  is king. But what does that mean  Well  on the one hand  that means there are more drugs  more available  more easily  to more people. And by my reckoning  that is not a good thing. But  on the other hand  if you are going to take drugs  you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality  which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs. And you can do so from the comfort of your own home  without the risks associated with buying on the streets. Now  as I said  you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. And the    or so sites that are currently in operation    by the way  they don't always work  they're not always perfect  the site that I showed you was shut down    months ago  but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. But these markets  because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating  the inhospitable conditions  are always innovating  always thinking of ways of getting smarter  more decentralized  harder to censor  and more customer friendly. Let's take the payment system. You don't pay with your credit card  of course    that would lead directly back to you. So you use the crypto currency bitcoin  which is easily exchanged for real world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users. But at the beginning of these sites  people noticed a flaw. Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out. The community came up with a solution  called multi signature escrow payments. So on purchasing my item  I would send my bitcoin to a neutral  secure third digital wallet. The vendor  who would see that I'd sent it  would be confident that they could then send the product to me  and then when I received it  at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction    vendor  buyer  site administrator    would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature  and then the money would be transferred. Brilliant  Elegant. It works. But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin  because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger. So if you're clever  you can try and work out who's behind them. So they came up with a tumbling service. Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address  they're tumbled and jumbled up  and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients  but they're different bitcoins  micro laundering systems. It's incredible. Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets  Check Grams  the search engine. You can even buy some advertising space. Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing  Yeah. One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine. That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords  but Guatemalan farmers. They even promised to reinvest    percent of any profits into local education programs. There's even a mystery shopper. Now  whatever you think about the morality of these sites    and I submit that it's not actually an easy question    the creation of functioning  competitive  anonymous markets  where nobody knows who anybody else is  constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities  is a staggering achievement  a phenomenal achievement. And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come. It's easy to forget that because of its short life  the Internet has actually changed many times over the last    years or so. It started in the '  s as a military project  morphed in the     s to an academic network  co opted by commercial companies in the '  s  and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties  but I think it's going to change again. And I think things like the dark net markets    creative  secure  difficult to censor    I think that's the future. And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy. Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy. The more time we spend online  the more we worry about them  and those surveys show our worries are growing. We're worried about what happens to our data. We're worried about who might be watching us. Since the revelations from Edward Snowden  there's been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy enhancing tools. There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser  the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate  sometimes even mundane. And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online    default encrypted messaging services. Ethereum  which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world  to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls. Now  we've had distributed computing before  of course. We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life. But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption    that's very  very hard to censor and control. Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles. Another called Twister  and so on and so on. And here's the thing    the more of us join  the more interesting those sites become  and then the more of us join  and so on. And I think that's what's going to happen. In fact  it's already happening. The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers. It's already going mainstream. Just recently  the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site. Facebook has started a dark net site. A group of London architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects. Yes  the dark net is going mainstream  and I predict that fairly soon  every social media company  every major news outlet  and therefore most of you in this audience  will be using the dark net  too. So the Internet is about to get more interesting  more exciting  more innovative  more terrible  more destructive. That's good news if you care about liberty. It's good news if you care about freedom. It's good news if you care about democracy. It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity. Neither entirely dark  nor entirely light. It's not one side or the other that's going to win out  but both. Thank you very much  indeed. Chris Anderson  You were something of a mathematical phenom. You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age. And then the NSA came calling. What was that about  Jim Simons  Well the NSA    that's the National Security Agency    they didn't exactly come calling. They had an operation at Princeton  where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that. And I knew that existed. And they had a very good policy  because you could do half your time at your own mathematics  and at least half your time working on their stuff. And they paid a lot. So that was an irresistible pull. So  I went there. CA  You were a code cracker. JS  I was. CA  Until you got fired. JS  Well  I did get fired. Yes. CA  How come  JS  Well  how come  I got fired because  well  the Vietnam War was on  and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article  a magazine section cover story  about how we would win in Vietnam. And I didn't like that war  I thought it was stupid. And I wrote a letter to the Times  which they published  saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor  if anyone remembers that name  agrees with his views. And I gave my own views ... CA  Oh  OK. I can see that would    JS  ... which were different from General Taylor's. But in the end  nobody said anything. But then  I was    years old at this time  and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views. And I told him   I'm doing mostly mathematics now  and when the war is over  then I'll do mostly their stuff.  Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day    I told my local boss that I gave that interview. And he said   What'd you say   And I told him what I said. And then he said   I've got to call Taylor.  He called Taylor  that took    minutes. I was fired five minutes after that. CA  OK. JS  But it wasn't bad. CA  It wasn't bad  because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career. You started working with this man here. Who is this  JS  Oh   Shiing Shen  Chern. Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century. I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. And I had some ideas  and I brought them to him and he liked them. Together  we did this work which you can easily see up there. There it is. CA  It led to you publishing a famous paper together. Can you explain at all what that work was  JS  No. JS  I mean  I could explain it to somebody. CA  How about explaining this  JS  But not many. Not many people. CA  I think you told me it had something to do with spheres  so let's start here. JS  Well  it did  but I'll say about that work    it did have something to do with that  but before we get to that    that work was good mathematics. I was very happy with it  so was Chern. It even started a little sub field that's now flourishing. But  more interestingly  it happened to apply to physics  something we knew nothing about    at least I knew nothing about physics  and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot. And about    years after the paper came out  a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory and people in Russia started applying it to what's called  condensed matter.  Today  those things in there called Chern Simons invariants have spread through a lot of physics. And it was amazing. We didn't know any physics. It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics. But that's the thing about mathematics    you never know where it's going to go. CA  This is so incredible. So  we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth. Somehow  you come up with a mathematical theory  not knowing any physics  discover two decades later that it's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world. How can that happen  JS  God knows. But there's a famous physicist named  Eugene  Wigner  and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Somehow  this mathematics  which is rooted in the real world in some sense    we learn to count  measure  everyone would do that    and then it flourishes on its own. But so often it comes back to save the day. General relativity is an example.  Hermann  Minkowski had this geometry  and Einstein realized   Hey  It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity.  So  you never know. It is a mystery. It is a mystery. CA  So  here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity. Tell us about this. JS  Well  that's a ball    it's a sphere  and it has a lattice around it    you know  those squares. What I'm going to show here was originally observed by  Leonhard  Euler  the great mathematician  in the     s. And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics  algebraic topology  geometry. That paper up there had its roots in this. So  here's this thing  it has eight vertices     edges  six faces. And if you look at the difference    vertices minus edges plus faces    you get two. OK  well  two. That's a good number. Here's a different way of doing it    these are triangles covering    this has    vertices and    edges and    faces     tiles. And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two. And in fact  you could do this any which way    cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up. And you take vertices minus edges plus faces    you'll get two. Here's a different shape. This is a torus  or the surface of a doughnut     vertices covered by these rectangles     edges     faces. Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero. It'll always come out to zero. Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles or anything like that  you're going to get zero. So  this is called the Euler characteristic. And it's what's called a topological invariant. It's pretty amazing. No matter how you do it  you're always get the same answer. So that was the first sort of thrust  from the mid     s  into a subject which is now called algebraic topology. CA  And your own work took an idea like this and moved it into higher dimensional theory  higher dimensional objects  and found new invariances  JS  Yes. Well  there were already higher dimensional invariants  Pontryagin classes    actually  there were Chern classes. There were a bunch of these types of invariants. I was struggling to work on one of them and model it sort of combinatorially  instead of the way it was typically done  and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things. But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler    who wrote almost    volumes of mathematics and had    children  who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing    if it wasn't for Mr. Euler  there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants. CA  OK  so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there. Let's talk about Renaissance. Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code cracker at the NSA  you started to become a code cracker in the financial industry. I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory. Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades. The way it's been explained to me  what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns  it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk  compared with other hedge funds. So how on earth did you do this  Jim  JS  I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people. When I started doing trading  I had gotten a little tired of mathematics. I was in my late   s  I had a little money. I started trading and it went very well. I made quite a lot of money with pure luck. I mean  I think it was pure luck. It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling. But in looking at the data  after a while I realized  it looks like there's some structure here. And I hired a few mathematicians  and we started making some models    just the kind of thing we did back at IDA  Institute for Defense Analyses . You design an algorithm  you test it out on a computer. Does it work  Doesn't it work  And so on. CA  Can we take a look at this  Because here's a typical graph of some commodity. I look at that  and I say   That's just a random  up and down walk    maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time.  How on earth could you trade looking at that  and see something that wasn't just random  JS  In the old days    this is kind of a graph from the old days  commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend. Not necessarily the very light trend you see here  but trending in periods. And if you decided  OK  I'm going to predict today  by the average move in the past    days    maybe that would be a good prediction  and I'd make some money. And in fact  years ago  such a system would work    not beautifully  but it would work. You'd make money  you'd lose money  you'd make money. But this is a year's worth of days  and you'd make a little money during that period. It's a very vestigial system. CA  So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether  for example  a    day trend or a    day trend was predictive of what happened next. JS  Sure  you would try all those things and see what worked best. Trend following would have been great in the '  s  and it was sort of OK in the '  s. By the '  s  it wasn't. CA  Because everyone could see that. So  how did you stay ahead of the pack  JS  We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches    shorter term approaches to some extent. The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data    and we had to get it by hand in the early days. We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories and stuff like that  because it didn't exist on computers. We got a lot of data. And very smart people    that was the key. I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading. I had hired a few    some made money  some didn't make money. I couldn't make a business out of that. But I did know how to hire scientists  because I have some taste in that department. So  that's what we did. And gradually these models got better and better  and better and better. CA  You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance  which is building this culture  this group of people  who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money. Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science. JS  Well  I'd hoped that might be true. But some of it was money. CA  They made a lot of money. JS  I can't say that no one came because of the money. I think a lot of them came because of the money. But they also came because it would be fun. CA  What role did machine learning play in all this  JS  In a certain sense  what we did was machine learning. You look at a lot of data  and you try to simulate different predictive schemes  until you get better and better at it. It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things. But it worked. CA  So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected. I mean  you looked at everything  right  You looked at the weather  length of dresses  political opinion. JS  Yes  length of dresses we didn't try. CA  What sort of things  JS  Well  everything. Everything is grist for the mill    except hem lengths. Weather  annual reports  quarterly reports  historic data itself  volumes  you name it. Whatever there is. We take in terabytes of data a day. And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis. You're looking for anomalies. You're looking for    like you said  the efficient market hypothesis is not correct. CA  But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. So  is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies  and see when they align  JS  Any one anomaly might be a random thing  however  if you have enough data you can tell that it's not. You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time    the probability of it being random is not high. But these things fade after a while  anomalies can get washed out. So you have to keep on top of the business. CA  A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it  by how much wealth is created there  and how much talent is going into it. Do you have any worries about that industry  and perhaps the financial industry in general  Kind of being on a runaway train that's    I don't know    helping increase inequality  How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry  JS  I think in the last three or four years  hedge funds have not done especially well. We've done dandy  but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully. The stock market has been on a roll  going up as everybody knows  and price earnings ratios have grown. So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last    let's say  five or six years    has not been created by hedge funds. People would ask me   What's a hedge fund   And I'd say   One and   .  Which means    now it's two and       it's two percent fixed fee and    percent of profits. Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures. CA  Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that. JS  We charged the highest fees in the world at one time. Five and     that's what we charge. CA  Five and   . So five percent flat     percent of upside. You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money. JS  We made good returns  yes. People got very mad   How can you charge such high fees   I said   OK  you can withdraw.  But  How can I get more   was what people were    But at a certain point  as I think I told you  we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund. CA  But should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent to work on that  as opposed to the many other problems in the world  JS  Well  it's not just mathematical. We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that. I don't think we should worry about it too much. It's still a pretty small industry. And in fact  bringing science into the investing world has improved that world. It's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity. Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff. So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund. CA  You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing  though  at the other end of the supply chain    you're actually boosting mathematics across America. This is your wife  Marilyn. You're working on philanthropic issues together. Tell me about that. JS  Well  Marilyn started    there she is up there  my beautiful wife    she started the foundation about    years ago. I think '  . I claim it was '    she says it was '    but it was one of those two years. We started the foundation  just as a convenient way to give charity. She kept the books  and so on. We did not have a vision at that time  but gradually a vision emerged    which was to focus on math and science  to focus on basic research. And that's what we've done. Six years ago or so  I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation. So that's what we do. CA  And so Math for America is basically investing in math teachers around the country  giving them some extra income  giving them support and coaching. And really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire. JS  Yeah    instead of beating up the bad teachers  which has created morale problems all through the educational community  in particular in math and science  we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status. Yeah  we give them extra money         dollars a year. We have     math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today  as part of a core. There's a great morale among them. They're staying in the field. Next year  it'll be       and that'll be    percent of the math and science teachers in New York  City  public schools. CA  Jim  here's another project that you've supported philanthropically  Research into origins of life  I guess. What are we looking at here  JS  Well  I'll save that for a second. And then I'll tell you what you're looking at. Origins of life is a fascinating question. How did we get here  Well  there are two questions  One is  what is the route from geology to biology    how did we get here  And the other question is  what did we start with  What material  if any  did we have to work with on this route  Those are two very  very interesting questions. The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA or something like that    how did that all work  And the other  what do we have to work with  Well  more than we think. So what's pictured there is a star in formation. Now  every year in our Milky Way  which has     billion stars  about two new stars are created. Don't ask me how  but they're created. And it takes them about a million years to settle out. So  in steady state  there are about two million stars in formation at any time. That one is somewhere along this settling down period. And there's all this crap sort of circling around it  dust and stuff. And it'll form probably a solar system  or whatever it forms. But here's the thing    in this dust that surrounds a forming star have been found  now  significant organic molecules. Molecules not just like methane  but formaldehyde and cyanide    things that are the building blocks    the seeds  if you will    of life. So  that may be typical. And it may be typical that planets around the universe start off with some of these basic building blocks. Now does that mean there's going to be life all around  Maybe. But it's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings  those seeds  all the way to life. And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets. CA  So for you  personally  finding an answer to this question of where we came from  of how did this thing happen  that is something you would love to see. JS  Would love to see. And like to know    if that path is tortuous enough  and so improbable  that no matter what you start with  we could be a singularity. But on the other hand  given all this organic dust that's floating around  we could have lots of friends out there. It'd be great to know. CA  Jim  a couple of years ago  I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk  and I asked him the secret of his success  and he said taking physics seriously was it. Listening to you  what I hear you saying is taking math seriously  that has infused your whole life. It's made you an absolute fortune  and now it's allowing you to invest in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere. Could it be that science actually works  That math actually works  JS  Well  math certainly works. Math certainly works. But this has been fun. Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable. CA  I just find it    it's an inspirational thought to me  that by taking knowledge seriously  so much more can come from it. So thank you for your amazing life  and for coming here to TED. Thank you. Jim Simons  So I grew up in Orlando  Florida. I was the son of an aerospace engineer. I lived and breathed the Apollo program. We either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape. I was impressed by  obviously  space and everything about it  but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it. Behind me you see an amazing view  a picture that was taken from the International Space Station  and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored. That place is called the stratosphere. If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up  it gets colder and colder and colder  until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere  and then an amazing thing happens. It gets colder at a much slower rate  and then it starts warming up  and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection  about zero degrees  and then you end up getting colder and colder  and that's the top of the stratosphere. It is one of the least accessible places on our planet. Most often  when it's visited  it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound  and they get a few seconds on the way up  and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in  on the way back in. But the question I asked is  is it possible to linger in the stratosphere  Is it possible to experience the stratosphere  Is it possible to explore the stratosphere  I studied this using my favorite search engine for quite a while  about a year  and then I made a scary phone call. It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum from Paragon Space Development Corporation  and I asked him the question  is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere  And he said it was. And after a period of about three years  we proceeded to do just that. And on October    of last year  in this suit  I started on the ground  I went up in a balloon to         feet    but who's counting  Came back to Earth at speeds of up to     miles an hour. It was a four minute and    second descent. And when I got to        feet  I opened a parachute and I landed. But this is really a science talk  and it's really an engineering talk  and what was amazing to me about that experience is that Taber said  yes  I think we can build a stratospheric suit  and more than that  come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it. And they did something which I think is important  which is they took the analogy of scuba diving. So in scuba diving  you have a self contained system. You have everything that you could ever need. You have a scuba tank. You have a wetsuit. You have visibility. And that scuba is exactly this system  and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere. Three years later  this is what we have. We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover. ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits. They had never sold a suit commercially  only to the government  but they sold one to me  which I am very grateful for. Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety. Everyone on the team knew that I have a wife and two small children       and       and I wanted to come back safely. So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute  and if I do nothing  the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device. The suit itself can protect me from the cold. This area in the front here has thermal protection. It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body. It has two redundant oxygen tanks. Even if I was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit  which is extremely unlikely  this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space. The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity. So the system weighs about     pounds  and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere  they used a capsule. And to do a capsule  there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it  and it weighed about       pounds  and to raise       pounds to an altitude of         feet  which was my target altitude  it would have taken a balloon that was    to    million cubic feet. Because I only weighed     pounds in this system  we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that  and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon. So with that  I want to take you to Roswell  New Mexico  on October   . We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night. And here's the suit. Again  this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second  and I want to play you a video of the actual launch. Roswell's a great place to launch balloons  but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute  especially when you're going to land    miles away from the place you started. That's a helium truck in the background. It's darkness. I've already spent about an hour and a half pre breathing. And then here you see the suit going on. It takes about an hour to get the suit on. Astronauts get this really nice air conditioned van to go to the launch pad  but I got a front loader. You can see the top. You can see the balloon up there. That's where the helium is. This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for    miles. And there we go. That's me waving with my left hand. The reason I'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway. My team forbade me from using my right hand. So the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse. It took two hours and seven minutes to go up  and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes. I was mostly trying to relax. My heart rate was very low and I was trying not to use very much oxygen. You can see how the fields in the background are relatively big at this point  and you can see me going up and up. It's interesting here  because if you look  I'm right over the airport  and I'm probably at        feet  but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over     miles an hour. This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon  and I was about       feet from release. This is what it looks like. You can see the darkness of space  the curvature of the Earth  the fragile planet below. I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now. If anything goes wrong  I want to be ready. And the main thing that I want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Alan Eustace  There's the balloon going by  fully inflated at this point. And there you can see a drogue parachute  which I'll demonstrate in just a second  because that's really important. There's the balloon going by a second time. Right now  I'm about at the speed of sound. There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound  and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get      miles an hour. AE  So now I'm down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there. At this point  I'm very happy that there's a parachute out. I thought I was the only one happy  but it turns out mission control was really happy as well. The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened    I had a close of friend of mine  Blikkies  my parachute guy. He flew in another airplane  and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me. He was my wingman on the descent. This is my landing  but it's probably more properly called a crash. I hate to admit it  but this wasn't even close to my worst landing. AE  Hi there  Yay. So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video  but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release. And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute  and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me. And I'll show you one of those right now. If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving  you probably used one of these. But the problem with one of these things is right when you release  you're in zero gravity. So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you. And before you know it  you can be tangled up or spinning  or you can release this drogue late  in which case what happens is you're going down at     miles an hour  and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea  and it was a roll that looks like that  but watch what happens when I pull it out. It's forming a pipe. This pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around  and there's no way it will ever tangle with you. And that prevented a very serious potential problem. So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people. The core of this was about    people that worked on this for the three years  and they were incredible. People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was  and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine. It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people. And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google  both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that I was away. But there's one other group I wanted to thank  and that's my family. Yay. I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology  and they weren't hearing any of it. It was super hard on them  and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the     tests  and she didn't want to take that away from me. So I want to close with a story. My daughter Katelyn  my    year old  she and I were in the car  and we were driving down the road  and she was sitting there  and she had this idea  and she goes   Dad  I've got this idea.  And so I listened to her idea and I said   Katelyn  that's impossible.  And she looks at me and she goes   Dad  after what you just did  how can you call anything impossible   And I laughed  and I said   OK  it's not impossible  it's just very  very hard.  And then I paused for a second  and I said   Katelyn  it may not be impossible  it may not even be very  very hard  it's just that I don't know how to do it.  Thank you. Today I'm going to talk about work. And the question I want to ask and answer is this   Why do we work   Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED like adventure to another  You may be asking yourselves that very question. Now  I know of course  we have to make a living  but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question   Why do we work   For folks in this room  the work we do is challenging  it's engaging  it's stimulating  it's meaningful. And if we're lucky  it might even be important. So  we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid  but that's not why we do what we do. And in general  I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do. When we say of somebody that he's  in it for the money   we are not just being descriptive. Now  I think this is totally obvious  but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question. Why  if this is so obvious  why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet  the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning  How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous  meaningless and soul deadening  Why is it that as capitalism developed  it created a mode of production  of goods and services  in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated  Workers who do this kind of work  whether they do it in factories  in call centers  or in fulfillment warehouses  do it for pay. There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay. So the question is   Why   And here's the answer  the answer is technology. Now  I know  I know    yeah  yeah  yeah  technology  automation screws people  blah blah    that's not what I mean. I'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives  and that people come to TED to hear about. I'm not talking about the technology of things  profound though that is. I'm talking about another technology. I'm talking about the technology of ideas. I call it   idea technology     how clever of me. In addition to creating things  science creates ideas. Science creates ways of understanding. And in the social sciences  the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves. And they have an enormous influence on how we think  what we aspire to  and how we act. If you think your poverty is God's will  you pray. If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy  you shrink into despair. And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination  then you rise up in revolt. Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution  depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty. This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings  and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us. And there's something special about idea technology  that makes it different from the technology of things. With things  if the technology sucks  it just vanishes  right  Bad technology disappears. With ideas    false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true. Because if people believe that they're true  they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas. And that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work  except for the pay at the end of the day. Because the father    one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution  Adam Smith    was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy  and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while  and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing  by giving them rewards. That was the only reason anyone ever did anything. So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature. But once that system of production was in place  there was really no other way for people to operate  except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision. So the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true. It is not true that you  just can't get good help anymore.  It is true that you  can't get good help anymore  when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless. And interestingly enough  Adam Smith    the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production  and division of labor    understood this. He said  of people who worked in assembly lines  of men who worked in assembly lines  he says   He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.  Now  notice the word here is  become.   He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.  Whether he intended it or not  what Adam Smith was telling us there  is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted. The thing about science    natural science    is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos  and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories. It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theories we have about the cosmos. But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature  because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings. The distinguished anthropologist  Clifford Geertz  said  years ago  that human beings are the  unfinished animals.  And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live. That human nature  that is to say our human nature  is much more created than it is discovered. We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work. And so you people    pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe    you people should be asking yourself a question  as you go back home to run your organizations. Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design  Thank you. Thanks. Well  we all need a reason to wake up. For me  it just took        volts. I know you're too polite to ask  so I will tell you. One night  sophomore year of college  just back from Thanksgiving holiday  a few of my friends and I were horsing around  and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there  with the wires that run overhead. Somehow  that seemed like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back  and when I stood up  the electrical current entered my arm  blew down and out my feet  and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works  Takes a licking  My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship with death    my death    and it also began my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now  the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction    to match its brilliance  to be sure. I'm a physician now  a hospice and palliative medicine doc  so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me  almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well    I mean  truly. But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve. Why  Well  there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question  and it explains a lot  because healthcare was designed with diseases  not people  at its center. Which is to say  of course  it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life  where things are so distilled and concentrated. There are no do overs. My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. That is  to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental opportunity in front of us  before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society  to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people  the scariest thing about death isn't being dead  it's dying  suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this  it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is  from suffering we can change. The former is a natural  essential part of life  part of the deal  and to this we are called to make space  adjust  grow. It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality  like a cosmic right sizing. After my limbs were gone  that loss  for example  became fact  fixed    necessarily part of my life  and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while  but I learned it eventually. Now  another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver    human beings. This  we are finally realizing  is where healing happens. Yes  compassion    literally  as we learned yesterday    suffering together. Now  on the systems side  on the other hand  so much of the suffering is unnecessary  invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is  since this brand of suffering is made up  well  we can change it. How we die is indeed something we can affect. Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day. After all  our role as caregivers  as people who care  is to relieve suffering    not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care  I function as something of a reflective advocate  as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside  palliative care    a very important field but poorly understood    while it includes  it is not limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now  let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue  but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life    really  about our lives. In this way  Frank grieves. In this way  he keeps up with his losses as they roll in  so that he's ready to take in the next moment. Loss is one thing  but regret  quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer    he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting    and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day  saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea  With all the risks to his safety and his health  some would say no. Many did  but he went for it  while he still could. It was a glorious  marvelous trip  freezing water  blistering dry heat  scorpions  snakes  wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon    all the glorious side of the world beyond our control. Frank's decision  while maybe dramatic  is exactly the kind so many of us would make  if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective. After my accident  when I went back to college  I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art  I figured I'd learn something about how to see    a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective  that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with  turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward  now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project  where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies  the mortuary men come  and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden  heading for the gate  we pause. Anyone who wants    fellow residents  family  nurses  volunteers  the hearse drivers too  now    shares a story or a song or silence  as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. It takes a few minutes  it's a sweet  simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth  rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting  much like this    floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in  the body's whisked away  and it all feels as though that person had never really existed. Well intended  of course  in the name of sterility  but hospitals tend to assault our senses  and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness    anesthetic  literally the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do  I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness. They are no place to live and die  that's not what they were designed for. Now mind you    I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston  New Jersey  where I got really great care at every turn  including good palliative care for my pain. And one night  it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room  but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. Next day  one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand  and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin  the miracle of it all  the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. In that moment  just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not. In a hospital  that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years  I've known many people who were ready to go  ready to die. Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence  but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become    in a word  cut off  or ugly. There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness  and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create something new  something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known  policy  education and training  systems  bricks and mortar. We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with. We know  for example  from research what's most important to people who are closer to death  comfort  feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love  existential peace  and a sense of wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly    years  we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS. Well  guess what  She wants to start smoking again    and French cigarettes  if you please. Not out of some self destructive bent  but to feel her lungs filled while she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate    she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed  his cold muzzle against her dry skin  instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins    she's done that. Sensuous  aesthetic gratification  where in a moment  in an instant  we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses  by way of the body    the very thing doing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen  which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little  if anything at all. But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels  smell  a symbolic plane. Seriously  with all the heavy duty stuff happening under our roof  one of the most tried and true interventions we know of  is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses    even just one    we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human  connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for  impulses that make us stay present    no need for a past or a future. So  if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue  then tending to dignity by way of the senses  by way of the body    the aesthetic realm    is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today  namely  we need to lift our sights  to set our sights on well being  so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful  rather than just less horrible. Beneficence. Here  this gets right at the distinction between a disease centered and a patient  or human centered model of care  and here is where caring becomes a creative  generative  even playful act.  Play  may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. The need for cover  fashion. And for being subjected to the clock  well  we invented music. So  since dying is a necessary part of life  what might we create with this fact  By  play  I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move  and one way or another  we will all kneel there. Rather  I am asking that we make space    physical  psychic room  to allow life to play itself all the way out    so that rather than just getting out of the way  aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this. Meanwhile  we can    We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on  and that's something we can all say one way or another. I got to redesign my life around this fact  and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left  like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment  all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously  then maybe we can learn to live well    not in spite of death  but because of it. Let death be what takes us  not lack of imagination. Thank you. Billie Jean King  Hi  everyone  Thanks  Pat. Thank you  Getting me all wound up  now  Pat Mitchell  Good  You know  when I was watching the video again of the match  you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took. Were you feeling that  BJK  First of all  Bobby Riggs    he was the former number one player  he wasn't just some hacker  by the way. He was one of my heroes and I admired him. And that's the reason I beat him  actually  because I respected him. It's true    my mom and especially my dad always said   Respect your opponent  and never underestimate them  ever.  And he was correct. He was absolutely correct. But I knew it was about social change. And I was really nervous whenever we announced it  and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders. And I thought   If I lose  it's going to put women back    years  at least.  Title IX had just been passed the year before    June         . And women's professional tennis    there were nine of us who signed a one dollar contract in         now remember  the match is in '  . So we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play  have a place to compete and make a living. So there were nine of us that signed that one dollar contract. And our dream was for any girl  born any place in the world    if she was good enough    there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living. Because before       we made    dollars a day  and we were under the control of organizations. So we really wanted to break away from that. But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much  we knew it was about the future generations. We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us  there is no question. But every generation has the chance to make it better. That was really on my mind. I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX. Title IX  in case anybody doesn't know  which a lot of people probably don't  said that any federal funds given to a high school  college or university  either public or private  had to    finally    give equal monies to boys and girls. And that changed everything. So you can have a law  but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it. That's when it really rocks  totally. So that was on my mind. I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds. But two things came out of that match. For women  self confidence  empowerment. They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise. Some women have waited        years to ask. I said   More importantly  did you get it   And they did  And for the men  A lot of the men today don't realize it  but if you're in your   s    s or whatever  late   s  you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement    whether you like it or not  And for the men  what happened for the men  they'd come up to me    and most times  the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes  it's very interesting. They go   Billie  I was very young when I saw that match  and now I have a daughter. And I am so happy I saw that as a young man.  And one of those young men  at    years old  was President Obama. And he actually told me that when I met him  he said   You don't realize it  but I saw that match at   . And now I have two daughters  and it has made a difference in how I raise them.  So both men and women got a lot out of it  but different things. PM  And now there are generations    at least one or two    who have experienced the equality that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible. And for women  there are generations who have also experienced teamwork. They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before. So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete  a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the Women's Sports Foundation. What now are you looking to accomplish with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative  BJK  I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at   . At     I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world  and a friend had asked me to play and I said   What's that   Tennis was not in my family    basketball was  other sports. Fast forward to    years old  and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year. So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club  and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was  but also that everybody who played wore white shoes  white clothes  played with white balls    everybody who played was white. And I said to myself  at    years old   Where is everyone else   And that just kept sticking in my brain. And that moment  I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls  men and women  the rest of my life. And that tennis  if I was fortunate enough to become number one    and I knew  being a girl  it would be harder to have influence  already at that age    that I had this platform. And tennis is global. And I thought   You know what  I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had.  I didn't know if I was going to make it    this was only   . I sure wanted it  but making it is a whole other discussion. I just remember I promised myself  and I really try to keep my word. That's who I truly am  just fighting for people. And  unfortunately  women have had less. And we are considered less. And so my attentions  where did they have to go  It was just ... you have to. And learn to stick up for yourself  hear your own voice. You hear the same words keep coming out all the time  and I got really lucky because I had an education. And I think if you can see it you can be it  you know  If you can see it  you can be it. You look at Pat  you look at other leaders  you look at these speakers  look at yourself  because everyone    everyone    can do something extraordinary. Every single person. PM  And your story  Billie  has inspired so many women everywhere. Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative  you're taking on an even bigger cause. Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice  working to find their way into leadership positions. But what you're talking about is even bigger than that. It's inclusive leadership. And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively    BJK  Isn't it great  Look at the technology  It's amazing how it connects us all  It's about connection. It's simply amazing what's possible because of it. But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative is really about the workforce mostly  and trying to change it  so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves. Because most of us have two jobs  One  to fit in    I'll give you a perfect example. An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work  straightens her hair in the bathroom  goes to the bathroom probably four  five  six times a day to keep straightening her hair  to keep making sure she fits in. So she's working two jobs. She's got this other job  whatever that may be  but she's also trying to fit in. Or this poor man who kept his diploma    he went to University of Michigan  but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster  ever    just would not mention it. So he made sure they saw he was well educated. And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL    which means American football for all of you out there  it's a big deal  it's very macho    and he talked about football all the time  because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know. It just goes on and on. So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self       that would be the ultimate. And we catch ourselves    I mean  I catch myself to this day. Even being gay I catch myself  you know  like  a little uncomfortable  a little surge in my gut  feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin. So  I think you have to ask yourself    I want people to be themselves  whatever that is  just let it be. PM  And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that  that these examples you just used    that many of us have the problem of being authentic. But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation  who have benefited from all these equal opportunities    which may not be equal but exist everywhere    BJK  First of all  I'm really lucky. Partnership with Teneo  a strategic company that's amazing. That's really the reason I'm able to do this. I've had two times in my life where I've actually had men really behind me with power. And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims  and this is the second time in my entire life. And then Deloitte. The one thing I wanted was data    facts. So Deloitte sent out a survey  and over       people now have answered  and we're continuing in the workplace. And what do the millennials feel  Well  they feel a lot  but what they're so fantastic about is    you know  our generation was like   Oh  we're going to get representation.  So if you walk into a room  you see everybody represented. That's not good enough anymore  which is so good  So the millennials are fantastic  they want connection  engagement. They just want you to tell us what you're feeling  what you're thinking  and get into the solution. They're problem solvers  and of course  you've got the information at your fingertips  compared to when I was growing up. PM  What did the research show you about millennials  Are they going to make a difference  Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force  BJK  Well  in          percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials. I think they are going to help solve problems. I think they have the wherewithal to do it. I know they care a lot. They have big ideas and they can make big things happen. I want to stay in the now with the young people  I don't want to get behind. PM  I don't think there's any chance  But what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials. BJK  No  well  if we want to talk    OK  I've been doing my little mini survey. I've been talking to the Boomers  who are their bosses  and I go   What do you think about the millennials   And I'm pretty excited  like it's good  and they get this face     Oh  you mean the 'Me' generation   I say   Do you really think so  Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things.  And they go   Oh  Billie  they cannot focus.  They actually have proven that the average focus for an    year old is    seconds. They can't focus. And they don't really care. I just heard a story the other night  a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers. She gets a text from one of the workers  like an intern  she's just starting    she goes   Oh  by the way  I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's.  So she arrives  and this boss says   What's going on   And she says   Oh  I was late  sorry  how's it going   She says   Well  guess what  I'd like you leave  you're finished.  She goes   OK.  No problem  PM  Now Billie  that story    I know  but that's what scares the boomers    I'm just telling you    so I think it's good for us to share. No  it is good for us to share  because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling  so we've got to take it both ways  you know  But I have great faith because    if you've been in sports like I have    every generation gets better. It's a fact. With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still  because we're trying to keep protecting the law  because it's in a tenuous position always  so we really are concerned  and we do a lot of research. That's very important to us. And I want to hear from people. But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide. And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected. And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls  at least in sports  have gone up against    whatever institutions    has won  Title IX is there to protect us. And it is amazing. But we still have to get the hearts and minds    the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge. PM  So what gets you up every morning  What keeps you sustaining your work  sustaining the fight for equality  extending it  always exploring new areas  trying to find new ways ...   BJK  Well  I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one. I'm highly motivated. My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player. My poor parents did not care if we were any good. And we drove them crazy because we pushed  we pushed because we wanted to be the best. And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks. I think to listen to these different women  to listen to different people  to listen to President Carter       years old  by the way  and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never    I'd have to go   Excuse me  wait a minute  I need to get a list out of these figures.  He was rattling off    I mean  that's amazing  I'm sorry. PM  He's an amazing man. BJK  And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson  who's a former president    Thank you  Irish     percent  LGBTQ  Yes  Congress is voting in June on same sex marriage  so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear. But always remember  every one of us is an individual  a human being with a beating heart  who cares and wants to live their authentic life. OK  You don't have to agree with somebody  but everyone has the opportunity. I think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward  always. And these people have been so inspiring. Everyone matters. And every one of you is an influencer. You out there listening  out there in the world  plus the people here    every single person's an influencer. Never  ever forget that. OK  So don't ever give up on yourself. PM  Billie  you have been an inspiration for us. BJK  Thanks  Pat  Thanks  TED  Thanks a lot  What I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about fear and the cost of fear and the age of fear from which we are now emerging. I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety. I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey. I could worry before I could walk. Please  applaud that. Thank you. But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear. We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war. Now even my seven year old brain knew that wasn't going to work. But I also knew that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with. And yet  despite the fact that we lived for    years with the threat of such a war  the response of our government and of our society was to do wonderful things. We created the space program in response to that. We built our highway system in response to that. We created the Internet in response to that. So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response. But sometimes it can produce an un constructive response. On September              guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings. They exacted a horrible toll. It is not for us to minimize what that toll was. But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate    disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged. We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States and of many governments to address a threat that  at the time that those attacks took place  was quite limited. In fact  according to our intelligence services  on September           there were     members of core Al Qaeda. There were just a few thousand terrorists. They posed an existential threat to no one. But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War. We launched two wars. We spent trillions of dollars. We suspended our values. We violated international law. We embraced torture. We embraced the idea that if these    guys could do this  anybody could do it. And therefore  for the first time in history  we were seeing everybody as a threat. And what was the result of that  Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries    hundreds of millions of people    setting aside whether those countries were our allies  setting aside what our interests were. I would argue that    years later  since today there are more terrorists  more terrorist attacks  more terrorist casualties    this by the count of the U.S. State Department    since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history  since the Flood  perhaps  we have not succeeded in our response. Now you have to ask  where did we go wrong  What did we do  What was the mistake that was made  And you might say  well look  Washington is a dysfunctional place. There are political food fights. We've turned our discourse into a cage match. And that's true. But there are bigger problems  believe it or not  than that dysfunction  even though I would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do  because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress. But there are other problems. And the other problems came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now  we're in a creativity crisis. In Washington  in think tanks  where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas  you don't get bold new ideas  because if you offer up a bold new idea  not only are you attacked on Twitter  but you will not get confirmed in a government job. Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate  you get governments that have an us versus them mentality  tiny groups of people making decisions. When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions  what do you get  You get groupthink. Everybody has the same worldview  and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat. That's a danger. You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles. And so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight  that look forward  that do strategy    the parts in other governments that do this    can't do it  because they're reacting to the news cycle. And so we're not looking ahead. On       we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way. Today we have a crisis because  because of       we are still looking in the wrong direction  and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on       far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists  far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today. In fact  the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms. They may be a reaction to bigger trends. And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend  then we've got far bigger problems to deal with. And so what are those trends  Well  to a group like you  the trends are apparent. We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven. If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago    it said that    percent of the people on the planet  by the year       would have a smartphone. They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket. In most of Africa  the cell phone penetration rate is    percent. We passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices  SIM cards  out in the world than there were people. We are within years of a profound moment in our history  when effectively every single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man made system for the first time  able to touch anyone else    touch them for good  touch them for ill. And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about  when they're thinking about these immediate threats. On the security side  we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war  and so we didn't  to a period that I call Cool War  cyber war  where the costs of conflict are actually so low  that we may never stop. We may enter a period of constant warfare  and we know this because we've been in it for several years. And yet  we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard. We don't have the basic ideas formulated. If someone attacks us with a cyber attack  do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack  We don't know. If somebody launches a cyber attack  how do we deter them  When China launched a series of cyber attacks  what did the U.S. government do  It said  we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys  who are never coming to America. They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer who's going to take them into custody. It's a gesture    it's not a deterrent. Special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had. In fact  if you've got a cell phone  you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have  and would have highly classified    years ago. In my cell phone  I have an app that tells me where every plane in the world is  and its altitude  and its speed  and what kind of aircraft it is  and where it's going and where it's landing. They have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do. They're using these tools in new ways. When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist  he went in with a rifle... and an iPad. And the weapon was the iPad. Because he captured people  he terrorized them  he pointed the iPad at them  and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet  and he took over the world's media. But it doesn't just affect the security side. The relations between great powers    we thought we were past the bipolar era. We thought we were in a unipolar world  where all the big issues were resolved. Remember  It was the end of history. But we're not. We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet    that it was going to connect us  weave society together    are not necessarily true. In countries like China  you have the Great Firewall of China. You've got countries saying no  if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders. We control the content. We are going to control our security. We are going to manage that Internet. We are going to say what can be on it. We're going to set a different set of rules. Now you might think  well  that's just China. But it's not just China. It's China  India  Russia. It's Saudi Arabia  it's Singapore  it's Brazil. After the NSA scandal  the Russians  the Chinese  the Indians  the Brazilians  they said  let's create a new Internet backbone  because we can't be dependent on this other one. And so all of a sudden  what do you have  You have a new bipolar world in which cyber internationalism  our belief  is challenged by cyber nationalism  another belief. We are seeing these changes everywhere we look. We are seeing the advent of mobile money. It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect. It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania  where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones. There are  .  million people who don't have financial service access that are going to get it soon. A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell phone soon. It's not just going to give them the ability to bank. It's going to change what monetary policy is. It's going to change what money is. Education is changing in the same way. Healthcare is changing in the same way. How government services are delivered is changing in the same way. And yet  in Washington  we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State. We are trying to determine how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of    years ago  when in fact  we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we're ignoring it  partially because businesses are not willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them. And that gets us to another breakdown that's crucial  and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this  because the growth of America and real American national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War  was a public private partnership between science  technology and government that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things. But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph  it was radar and the Internet. It was Tang  the breakfast drink    probably not the most important of those developments. But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue  and the dialogue has broken down. It's broken down because in Washington  less government is considered more. It's broken down because there is  believe it or not  in Washington  a war on science    despite the fact that in all of human history  every time anyone has waged a war on science  science has won. But we have a government that doesn't want to listen  that doesn't have people at the highest levels that understand this. In the nuclear age  when there were people in senior national security jobs  they were expected to speak throw weight. They were expected to know the lingo  the vocabulary. If you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now and said   Talk to me about cyber  about neuroscience  about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow   you'd get a blank stare. I know  because when I wrote this book  I talked to     people  many from the science and tech side  who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table. Meanwhile  on the tech side  we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things  but they started in garages and they didn't need the government and they don't want the government. Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic  leave me alone. But the world's coming apart. All of a sudden  there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and privacy. And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues  which are philosophical issues. If you can't vote  if you can't have a job  if you can't bank  if you can't get health care  if you can't be educated without Internet access  is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions  If Internet access is a fundamental right  is electricity access for the  .  billion who don't have access to electricity a fundamental right  These are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers  Where's the dialogue  And that brings me to the reason that I'm here. I live in Washington. Pity me. The dialogue isn't happening there. These big issues that will change the world  change national security  change economics  create hope  create threats  can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government. Both sides need each other. And until we recreate that connection  until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow  then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable. The risks associated with      will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent. They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together scientists  technologists  government leaders  at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance  akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras that have happened on Earth  and start coming up with  if not the right answers  then at least the right questions. We are not there yet  but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed. And that's why I believe that groups like TED  discussions like this around the planet  are the place where the future of foreign policy  of economic policy  of social policy  of philosophy  will ultimately take place. And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you. Thank you very  very much. For the last    years  a lot of smart  well resourced people    some of you  no doubt    have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the United States. People have created and invested millions of dollars into non profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor. They've created think tanks that study issues like education  job creation and asset building  and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities. They've written books and columns and given passionate speeches  decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale. And that effort has helped. But it's not enough. Our poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last    years  since the War on Poverty was launched. I'm here to tell you that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource. Here it is  people who are poor. Up in the left hand corner is Jobana  Sintia and Bertha. They met when they all had small children  through a parenting class at a family resource center in San Francisco. As they grew together as parents and friends  they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little. Child care is expensive  more than they'd earn in a job. Their husbands worked  but they wanted to contribute financially  too. So they hatched a plan. They started a cleaning business. They plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends  and soon  they had clients calling. Two of them would clean the office or house and one of them would watch the kids. They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids. And they split the money three ways. It was not a full time gig  no one could watch the little ones all day. But it made a difference for their families. Extra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut. Money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing. A little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence. Up in the top right corner is Theresa and her daughter  Brianna. Brianna is one of those kids with this sparkly  infectious  outgoing personality. For example  when Rosie  a little girl who spoke only Spanish  moved in next door  Brianna  who spoke only English  borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate. I know  right  Rosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English. A few years ago  Brianna started to struggle academically. She was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class. And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening. Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and Brianna was devastated. Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed  and she did not know how to help her. One afternoon  Theresa was catching up with a group of friends  and one of them said   Theresa  how are you   And she burst into tears. After she shared her story  one of her friends said   I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago.  And in that moment  Theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it. So she created a support group for parents like her. The first meeting was her and two other people. But word spread  and soon    people     people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together. She went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter  with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle. And Brianna is doing fantastic    she's doing great academically and socially. That in the middle is my man Baakir  standing in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe  which he runs out of part of his house. As you walk in the door  Baakir greets you with a  Welcome black home.  Once inside  you can order some Algiers jerk chicken  perhaps a vegan walnut burger  or jive turkey sammich. And that's sammich    not sandwich. You must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop  which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe. For real  it's very secret  he won't tell you about it. But BlackStar is much more than a caf . For the kids in the neighborhood  it's a place to go after school to get help with homework. For the grown ups  it's where they go to find out what's going on in the neighborhood and catch up with friends. It's a performance venue. It's a home for poets  musicians and artists. Baakir and his partner Nicole  with their baby girl strapped to her back  are there in the mix of it all  serving up a cup of coffee  teaching a child how to play Mancala  or painting a sign for an upcoming community event. I have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than    years. I have organized against the prison system  which impacts poor folks  especially black  indigenous and Latino folks  at an alarming rate. I have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise  despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools  and police violence in their communities. I have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity to collectively create their own solutions. And they're not just focused on money. They're addressing education  housing  health  community    the things that we all care about. Everywhere I go  I see people who are broke but not broken. I see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas  so that they can create a better life for themselves  their families  their communities. Jobana  Sintia  Bertha  Theresa and Baakir are the rule  not the shiny exception. I am the exception. I was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester  New York. I was bussed to a school in the suburbs  from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous. At eight  I was a latchkey kid. I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores  and wait for my mother to come home. After school  I'd go to the corner store and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli  which I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack. If I had a little extra money  I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie. Cherry. Not as good as a buttermilk drop. We were poor when I was a kid. But now  I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland  California. I've built a career. My husband is a business owner. I have a retirement account. My daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown up at home and she doesn't have to  because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that I had to at her age. My kids' raviolis are organic and full of things like spinach and ricotta  because I have the luxury of choice when it comes to what my children eat. I am the exception  not because I'm more talented than Baakir or my mother worked any harder than Jobana  Sintia or Bertha  or cared any more than Theresa. Marginalized communities are full of smart  talented people  hustling and working and innovating  just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs. They are full of people tapping into their resilience to get up every day  get the kids off to school and go to jobs that don't pay enough  or get educations that are putting them in debt. They are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck  or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet. They are full of people doing for themselves and for others  whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor  or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill  or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop. I am the exception because of luck and privilege  not hard work. And I'm not being modest or self deprecating    I am amazing. But most people work hard. Hard work is the common denominator in this equation  and I'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success  because that allows    Thank you. ... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it  and by implication  those who don't make it don't deserve it. We tell ourselves  in the back of our minds  and sometimes in the front of our mouths   There must be something a little wrong with those poor people.  We have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is. Some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work. Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough  and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path  they could make it. For every story I hear demonizing low income single mothers or absentee fathers  which is how people might think of my parents  I've got    that tell a different story about the same people  showing up every day and doing their best. I'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true  but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are  because they don't paint a full picture. The quarter truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing. What if we recognized that what's working is the people and what's broken is our approach  What if we realized that the experts we are looking for  the experts we need to follow  are poor people themselves  What if  instead of imposing solutions  we just added fire to the already burning flame that they have  Not directing    not even empowering    but just fueling their initiative. Just north of here  we have an example of what this could look like  Silicon Valley. A whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them  we should give them lots and lots and lots of money. Right  But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir  There are no incubators for them  no accelerators  no fellowships. How are Jobana  Sintia and Bertha really all that different from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world  Baakir has experience and a track record. I'd put my money on him. So  consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy. Let's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired  faulty narrative and listen and look for true stories  more beautifully complex stories  about who marginalized people and families and communities are. I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people. We cannot wait for somebody else to get it right. Let us remember what we are capable of  all that we have built with blood  sweat and dreams  all the cogs that keep turning  and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work. Let us remember that we are magic. If you need some inspiration to jog your memory  read Octavia Butler's  Parable of the Sower.  Listen to Reverend King's  Letter from Birmingham Jail.  Listen to Suheir Hammad recite  First Writing Since   or Esperanza Spalding perform  Black Gold.  Set your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley or Favianna Rodriguez. Look at the hands of your grandmother or into the eyes of someone who loves you. We are magic. Individually  we don't have a lot of wealth and power  but collectively  we are unstoppable. And we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us. Instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways  let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth. Let's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us. Desmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu  in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process that they embarked on after apartheid. He says it means   My humanity is caught up  is inextricably bound up  in yours  we belong to a bundle of life.  A bundle of life. The Truth and Reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard. If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all  then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard  of people like Jobana  Sintia and Bertha  Theresa and Baakir. We must leverage their solutions and their ideas. We must listen to their true stories  their more beautifully complex stories. Thank you. I'm here to recruit men to support gender equality. Wait  wait. What  What do men have to do with gender equality  Gender equality is about women  right  I mean  the word gender is about women. Actually  I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man. Now  I wasn't always a middle class white man. It all happened for me about    years ago when I was in graduate school  and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day  and we said  you know  there's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory  but there's no courses yet. So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that. We said  OK  let's have a study group. We'll read a text  we'll talk about it  we'll have a potluck dinner. So every week     women and me got together. We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it. And during one of our conversations  I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever. It was a conversation between two women. One of the women was white  and one was black. And the white woman said    this is going to sound very anachronistic now    the white woman said   All women face the same oppression as women. All women are similarly situated in patriarchy  and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.  And the black woman said   I'm not so sure. Let me ask you a question.  So the black woman says to the white woman   When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror  what do you see   And the white woman said   I see a woman.  And the black woman said   You see  that's the problem for me. Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror   she said   I see a black woman. To me  race is visible. But to you  race is invisible. You don't see it.  And then she said something really startling. She said   That's how privilege works. Privilege is invisible to those who have it.  It is a luxury  I will say to the white people sitting in this room  not to have to think about race every split second of our lives. Privilege is invisible to those who have it. Now remember  I was the only man in this group  so when I witnessed this  I went   Oh no.  And somebody said   Well what was that reaction   And I said   Well  when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror  I see a human being. I'm kind of the generic person. You know  I'm a middle class white man. I have no race  no class  no gender. I'm universally generalizable.  So I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man  that class and race and gender were not about other people  they were about me. I had to start thinking about them  and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long. Now  I wish I could tell you this story ends    years ago in that little discussion group  but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach. I have a colleague  and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters. So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach. I give a guest lecture for her when she teaches. So I walk into her class to give a guest lecture  about     students in the room  and as I walk in  one of the students looks up and says   Oh  finally  an objective opinion.  All that semester  whenever my colleague opened her mouth  what my students saw was a woman. I mean  if you were to say to my students   There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States   they'd say   Well of course you'd say that. You're a woman. You're biased.  When I say it  they go   Wow  is that interesting. Is that going to be on the test  How do you spell 'structural'   So I hope you all can see  this is what objectivity looks like. Disembodied Western rationality. And that  by the way  is why I think men so often wear ties. Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality  you need a signifier  and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals  That is mind body dualism right there. So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality. Now  when men first hear about gender equality  when they first start thinking about it  they often think  many men think  well  that's right  that's fair  that's just  that's the ethical imperative. But not all men. Some men think    the lightning bolt goes off  and they go   Oh my God  yes  gender equality   and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression. They see supporting gender equality something akin to the cavalry  like   Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention  ladies  we'll take it from here.  This results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self congratulation.' There's another group  though  that actively resists gender equality  that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men. I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men. This is the beginning of the book I wrote  'Angry White Men.' These were four angry white men who believed that they  white men in America  were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace. And they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs  qualified for promotions  they didn't get them  they were really angry. And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title of this particular show. It was a quote from one of the men  and the quote was   A Black Woman Stole My Job.  And they all told their stories  qualified for jobs  qualified for promotions  didn't get it  really angry. And then it was my turn to speak  and I said   I have just one question for you guys  and it's about the title of the show  'A Black Woman Stole My Job.' Actually  it's about one word in the title. I want to know about the word 'my.' Where did you get the idea it was your job  Why isn't the title of the show  'A Black Woman Got the Job ' or 'A Black Woman Got A Job '  Because without confronting men's sense of entitlement  I don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality. Look  we think this is a level playing field  so any policy that tilts it even a little bit  we think   Oh my God  water's rushing uphill. It's reverse discrimination against us.  So let me be very clear  white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world. It is called  the history of the world.  So  now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men  but why should we support gender equality  Of course  it's fair  it's right and it's just. But more than that  gender equality is also in our interest as men. If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives  gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live. Gender equality is good for countries. It turns out  according to most studies  that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale. And that's not just because they're all in Europe. Even within Europe  those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness. It is also good for companies. Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender equal companies are  the better it is for workers  the happier their labor force is. They have lower job turnover. They have lower levels of attrition. They have an easier time recruiting. They have higher rates of retention  higher job satisfaction  higher rates of productivity. So the question I'm often asked in companies is   Boy  this gender equality thing  that's really going to be expensive  huh   And I say   Oh no  in fact  what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you. It is extremely expensive.  So it is good for business. And the other thing is  it's good for men. It is good for the kind of lives we want to live  because young men especially have changed enormously  and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children. They expect their partners  their spouses  their wives  to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are. I was talking  to give you an illustration of this change    Some of you may remember this. When I was a lot younger  there was a riddle that was posed to us. Some of you may wince to remember this riddle. This riddle went something like this. A man and his son are driving on the freeway  and they're in a terrible accident  and the father is killed  and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room  and as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room  the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says   Oh  I can't treat him  that's my son.  How is this possible  We were flummoxed by this. We could not figure this out. Well  I decided to do a little experiment with my    year old son. He had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house watching a game on TV recently. So I decided I would pose this riddle to them  just to see  to gauge the level of change. Well     year old boys  they immediately turned to me and said   It's his mom.  Right  No problem. Just like that. Except for my son  who said   Well  he could have two dads.  That's an index  an indicator of how things have changed. Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family. They want to be dual career  dual carer couples. They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners. They want to be involved fathers. Now  it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships  the happier both partners are. Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here. I think we have the persuasive numbers  the data  to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero sum game  but a win win. Here's what the data show. Now  when men begin the process of engaging with balancing work and family  we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do. We pitch in and we help out. And I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical  one word   share.  Because here's what the data show  when men share housework and childcare  their children do better in school. Their children have lower rates of absenteeism  higher rates of achievement. They are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. They are less likely to see a child psychiatrist. They are less likely to be put on medication. So when men share housework and childcare  their children are happier and healthier  and men want this. When men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier. Duh. Not only that  their wives are healthier. Their wives are less likely to see a therapist  less likely to be diagnosed with depression  less likely to be put on medication  more likely to go to the gym  report higher levels of marital satisfaction. So when men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier and healthier  and men certainly want this as well. When men share housework and childcare  the men are healthier. They smoke less  drink less  take recreational drugs less often. They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings. They are less likely to see a therapist  less likely to be diagnosed with depression  less likely to be taking prescription medication. So when men share housework and childcare  the men are happier and healthier. And who wouldn't want that  And finally  when men share housework and childcare  they have more sex. Now  of these four fascinating findings  which one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover   Housework Makes Her Horny. Now  I will say  just to remind the men in the audience  these data were collected over a really long period of time  so I don't want listeners to say   Hmm  OK  I think I'll do the dishes tonight.  These data were collected over a really long period of time. But I think it shows something important  that when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover  they also called  you'll love this   Choreplay.  So  what we found is something really important  that gender equality is in the interest of countries  of companies  and of men  and their children and their partners  that gender equality is not a zero sum game. It's not a win lose. It is a win win for everyone. And what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we engage boys and men. We know this. And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live. In       on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down Fifth Avenue in New York City  a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine  and the title of the article was   Feminism for Men.  And this was the first line of that article   Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free.  Thank you. I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.  To Fall in Love With Anyone  Do This.  And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory  and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer. So the procedure is fairly simple  two strangers take turns asking each other    increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes. So here are a couple of sample questions. Number     If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability  what would it be  Number     When did you last cry in front of another person  By yourself  As you can see  they really do get more personal as they go along. Number     I really like this one  Tell your partner what you like about them  be very honest this time  saying things you might not say to someone you just met. So when I first came across this study a few years earlier  one detail really stuck out to me  and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later  and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony. So I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love  but of course I was intrigued. And when I got the chance to try this study myself  with someone I knew but not particularly well  I wasn't expecting to fall in love. But then we did  and    And I thought it made a good story  so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later. Now  this was published in January  and now it is August  so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering  are we still together  And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months. And this question is really what I want to talk about today. But let's come back to it. So the week before the article came out  I was very nervous. I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years  so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog. But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most  and those were usually just my Facebook friends  and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views. And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship. But as it turned out  I had no idea. So the article was published online on a Friday evening  and by Saturday  this had happened to the traffic on my blog. And by Sunday  both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called. Within a month  the article would receive over   million views  and I was  to say the least  underprepared for this sort of attention. It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love  but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news    and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship. And when people called or emailed  which they did every day for weeks  they always asked the same question first  are you guys still together  In fact  as I was preparing this talk  I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase  Are you still together   and several messages popped up immediately. They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one. I did radio interviews and they asked. I even gave a talk  and one woman shouted up to the stage   Hey Mandy  where's your boyfriend   And I promptly turned bright red. I understand that this is part of the deal. If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper  you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it. But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response. The    questions seem to have taken on a life of their own. In fact  the New York Times published a follow up article for Valentine's Day  which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves  with varying degrees of success. So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship. I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together. I turned down TV interviews  and I said no to every request for photos of the two us. I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love  a position I did not at all feel qualified for. And I get it  people didn't just want to know if the study worked  they wanted to know if it really worked  that is  if it was capable of producing love that would last  not just a fling  but real love  sustainable love. But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering. My own relationship was only a few months old  and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place. What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them  If the answer was no  would it make the experience of doing these    questions any less worthwhile  Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in       and here  the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love. Instead  they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students  by using what Aron called  sustained  escalating  reciprocal  personalistic self disclosure.  Sounds romantic  doesn't it  But the study did work. The participants did feel closer after doing it  and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers. They've used it between members of the police and members of community  and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies. The original version of the story  the one that I tried last summer  that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact  was referenced in this article  but unfortunately it was never published. So a few months ago  I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college  and a student came up to me afterwards and he said  kind of shyly   So  I tried your study  and it didn't work.  He seemed a little mystified by this.  You mean  you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with   I asked.  Well...  He paused.  I think she just wants to be friends.   But did you become better friends   I asked.  Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study   He nodded.  So  then it worked   I said. I don't think this is the answer he was looking for. In fact  I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love. I first came across this study when I was    and I was going through a really difficult breakup. I had been in the relationship since I was     which was basically my entire adult life  and he was my first real love  and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him. So I turned to science. I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love  and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache. I don't know if I realized this at the time    I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing    but it seems really obvious in retrospect. I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love  I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then. And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways. I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed. I am more confident about asking for what I want. But I can also see myself more clearly  and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for. What I want from love is a guarantee  not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow  but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely. Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together. So the story that the media told about the    questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love. There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved  and this is a very appealing story  because falling in love feels amazing  but it's also terrifying. The moment you admit to loving someone  you admit to having a lot to lose  and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly  which is also a mechanism for being known  and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love  to be known  to be seen  to be understood. But I think when it comes to love  we are too willing to accept the short version of the story. The version of the story that asks   Are you still together   and is content with a yes or no answer. So rather than that question  I would propose we ask some more difficult questions  questions like  How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not  How do you stay in love when things get difficult  and how do you know when to just cut and run  How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship  or even harder  how do you live with your partner's doubt  I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions  but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone. So  if you want it  the short version of the story of my relationship is this  a year ago  an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love  and we fell in love  and we are still together  and I am so glad. But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love. Falling in love is the easy part. So at the end of my article  I wrote   Love didn't happen to us. We're in love because we each made the choice to be.  And I cringe a little when I read that now  not because it isn't true  but because at the time  I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice. I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice  and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me. I want it to be enough to have asked and answered    questions  and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America. But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in. And what I want  what perhaps I will spend my life wanting  is for that myth to be true. I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article  which is  incidentally  the only part of the article that I didn't actually write. But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone  and the hope that he will choose to love me back  and it is terrifying  but that's the deal with love. Thank you. Wow  what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like. So eight years ago  I got the worst career advice of my life. I had a friend tell me   Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now. It's all about just building your resume.  And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while  and I'd joined this Fortune     company. I thought   This is fantastic. I'm going to have big impact on the world.  I had all these ideas. And within about two months  I noticed at about   am every morning I had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer. I don't know if anyone's ever felt that. And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role. And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume. Well  as I'm trying to figure out what two story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up  I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett  and he said   Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age.  And I heard that  and that was all I needed. Within two weeks  I was out of there  and I left with one intention  to find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was. I wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was. And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone  it turns out that over    percent of the people around don't enjoy their work. I'm guessing this room is different  but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies. So I wanted to find out  what is it that sets these people apart  the people who do the passionate  world changing work  that wake up inspired every day  and then these people  the other    percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation. So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work  and I read books and did case studies      books altogether on purpose and career and all this  totally just self immersion  really for the selfish reason of    I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do  what that was for me. But as I was doing this  more and more people started to ask me   You're into this career thing. I don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch   I'd say   Sure.  But I would have to warn them  because at this point  my quit rate was also    percent. Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch     percent would quit their job within two months. I was proud of this  and it wasn't that I had any special magic. It was that I would ask one simple question. It was   Why are you doing the work that you're doing   And so often their answer would be   Well  because somebody told me I'm supposed to.  And I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb  and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall  or no wall at all. The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem  I thought  what if we could create a community  a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently  to take the road less traveled  where that was encouraged  and inspire people to change  And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend  which I'll explain in a little bit. But as I've made these discoveries  I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world changers have in common  whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just  you know  the person that has the bakery down the street. But you're doing work that embodies who you are. I want to share those three with you  so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life. The first part of this three step passionate work framework is becoming a self expert and understanding yourself  because if you don't know what you're looking for  you're never going to find it. And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us. There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career. I don't know how that's not a required double major  but don't even get me started on that. I mean  you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. But the point is  it's on us to figure that out  and we need a framework  we need a way to navigate through this. And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are. What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what  whether we're paid or we're not paid  the things that people thank us for  And the Strengths Finder  .  is a book and also an online tool. I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at. And next  what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions  Do we care about the people  our family  health  or is it achievement  success  all this stuff  We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions  so we know what our soul is made of  so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about. And then the next step is our experiences. All of us have these experiences. We learn things every day  every minute about what we love  what we hate  what we're good at  what we're terrible at. And if we don't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives  it's all for nothing. Every day  every week  every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right  what went wrong  and what do I want to repeat  what can I apply more to my life. And even more so than that  as you see people  especially today  who inspire you  who are doing things where you say  Oh God  what Jeff is doing  I want to be like him.  Why are you saying that  Open up a journal. Write down what it is about them that inspires you. It's not going to be everything about their life  but whatever it is  take note on that  so over time we'll have this repository of things that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact. Because when we start to put these things together  we can then define what success actually means to us  and without these different parts of the compass  it's impossible. We end up in the situation    we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere. It's kind of like in Wall Street    if anybody saw that  the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO   What's your number  Everyone's got a number  where if they make this money  they'll leave it all.  He says   Oh  it's simple. More.  And he just smiles. And it's the sad state of most of the people that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them  who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us  but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to. But once we have this framework together  we can start to identify the things that make us come alive. You know  before this  a passion could come and hit you in the face  or maybe in your possible line of work  you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it. But once you do  you can see something that's congruent with my strengths  my values  who I am as a person  so I'm going to grab ahold of this  I'm going to do something with it  and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it. And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify   Wow  this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with.  If we don't know what we're looking for  we're never going to find it  but once we have this framework  this compass  then we can move on to what's next    and that's not me up there    doing the impossible and pushing our limits. There's two reasons why people don't do things. One is they tell themselves they can't do them  or people around them tell them they can't do them. Either way  we start to believe it. Either we give up  or we never start in the first place. The things is  everyone was impossible until somebody did it. Every invention  every new thing in the world  people thought were crazy at first. Roger Bannister and the four minute mile  it was a physical impossibility to break the four minute mile in a foot race until Roger Bannister stood up and did it. And then what happened  Two months later     people broke the four minute mile. The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit. And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything  because we can control that. If you don't think you can run a mile  you show yourself you can run a mile or two  or a marathon  or lose five pounds  or whatever it is  you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world. And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends. We have this little group. We go on physical adventures  and recently  I found myself in a kind of precarious spot. I'm terrified of deep  dark  blue water. I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear ever since they watched Jaws         and   like six times when I was a kid. But anything above here  if it's murky  I can already feel it right now. I swear there's something in there. Even if it's Lake Tahoe  it's fresh water  totally unfounded fear  ridiculous  but it's there. Anyway  three years ago I find myself on this tugboat right down here in the San Francisco Bay. It's a rainy  stormy  windy day  and people are getting sick on the boat  and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit  and I'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death. I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate. And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before. I'm sitting there  and my buddy Jonathan  who had talked me into it  he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in. And he says   Scott  hey man  what's the worst that could happen  You're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink. And If you can't make it  just hop on one of the    kayaks. Plus  if there's a shark attack  why are they going to pick you over the    people in the water   So thanks  that helps. He's like   But really  just have fun with this. Good luck.  And he dives in  swims off. OK. Turns out  the pep talk totally worked  and I felt this total feeling of calm  and I think it was because Jonathan was    years old. And of the    people swimming that day     of them were between the ages of nine and   . Think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in    degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco. What would you have said yes to  What would you have not given up on  What would you have tried  As I'm finishing this swim  I get to Aquatic Park  and I'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished  so they're cheering me on and they're all excited. And I got total popsicle head  if anyone's ever swam in the Bay  and I'm trying to just thaw my face out  and I'm watching people finish. And I see this one kid  something didn't look right. And he's just flailing like this. And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down. And I notice other parents were watching too  and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was  this is why you don't let nine year olds swim from Alcatraz. This was not fatigue. All of a sudden  two parents run up and grab him  and they put him on their shoulders  and they're dragging him like this  totally limp. And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair. And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen. I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he made this accomplishment. I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair. I just had no idea he was going to swim. I mean  where is he going to be in    years  How many people told him he couldn't do that  that he would die if tried that  You prove people wrong  you prove yourself wrong  that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible. You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world  just your own impossibilities  to accomplish those  and it starts with little bitty steps. And the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people. The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them. There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.  You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner. They change everything  and it's a proven fact. In       Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists  and he would measure their times around the track in a group  and also individually. And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster. And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then  and it proves the same thing over again  that the people around you matter  and environment is everything. But it's on you to control it  because it can go both ways. With    percent of people who don't like the work they do  that means most people around us  not in this room  but everywhere else  are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings. I found myself in this situation    personal example  a couple years ago. Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into  unbelievable amount of time  and they so badly want to call it a business  but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime  OK  I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them  and I was doing all I could  and there were only three people paying attention  and they're all right there  my mother  father and my wife  Chelsea. Thank you guys for the support. And this is how badly I wanted it  it grew at zero percent for four years  and I was about to shut it down  and right about then  I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure  of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way. And one of my friends  now  he has a family of eight  and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week. They just came back from a month in Europe  all of them together. This blew my mind. How does this even exist  And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this  and instead of shutting it down  I decided  let's take it seriously. And I did everything I could to spend my time  every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys  hanging out and having beers and workouts  whatever it was. And after four years of zero growth  within six months of hanging around these people  the community at Live Your Legend grew by    times. In another    months  it grew by     times. And today over        people from     countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis. And those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of for Live Your Legend so many years back. The people change everything  and this is why    you know  you ask what was going on. Well  for four years  I knew nobody in this space  and I didn't even know it existed  that people could do this stuff  that you could have movements like this. And then I'm over here in San Francisco  and everyone around me was doing it. It became normal  so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not. And right then  when that happens  that switch goes on in your head  it ripples across your whole world. And without even trying  your standards go from here to here. You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings. That's it  and that's why I love being around this whole group of people  why I go to every TED event I can  and watch them on my iPad on the way to work  whatever it is. Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility. We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more. To sum things up  in terms of these three pillars  they all have one thing in common more than anything else. They are     percent in our control. No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself. No one can tell you you can't push your limits and learn your own impossible and push that. No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down. You can't control a recession. You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident. Most things are totally out of our hands. These three things are totally on us  and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it. And the thing is  it's starting to happen on a widespread level. I just read in Forbes  the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off. They thought this was an anomaly  but it's happened three months straight. In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment  people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life  the things that people say you're supposed to do  in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them. And the thing is  people are waking up to this possibility  that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination. That's not a clich  anymore. I don't care what it is that you're into  what passion  what hobby. If you're into knitting  you can find someone who is killing it knitting  and you can learn from them. It's wild. And that's what this whole day is about  to learn from the folks speaking  and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day  because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary  and we can be around that  it becomes normal. And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs  doing something crazy. It's just about doing something that matters to you  and makes an impact that only you can make. Speaking of Gandhi  he was a recovering lawyer  as I've heard the term  and he was called to a greater cause  something that mattered to him  he couldn't not do. And he has this quote that I absolutely live by.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  then you win.  Everything was impossible until somebody did it. You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done and tell you you're stupid for trying  or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility  the people who are in this room. Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal. And that's already starting to happen. First  do the things that inspire us  so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them. But we can't find that unless we know what we're looking for. We have to do our work on ourself  be intentional about that  and make those discoveries. Because I imagine a world where    percent of people love the work they do. What would that look like  What would the innovation be like  How would you treat the people around you  Things would start to change. And as we finish up  I have just one question to ask you guys  and I think it's the only question that matters. And it's what is the work you can't not do  Discover that  live it  not just for you  but for everybody around you  because that is what starts to change the world. What is the work you can't not do  Thank you guys. My father was five years old when he lost his father  but by the time I was born  he was already a businessman. But it didn't make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl  they were going to go to school. So I guess I was the lucky one. My mother had    pregnancies. From    pregnancies  five of us are alive. You can imagine as a child what I went through. Day to day  I watched women being carried to a graveyard  or watched children going to a graveyard. At that time  when I finished my high school  I really wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children. So I completed my education  but I wanted to go to university. Unfortunately  in my country  there wasn't a dormitory for girls  so I was accepted in medical school  but I could not go there. So as a result  my father sent me to America. I came to America. I completed my education. While I was completing my education  my country was invaded by Russia. And do you know that at the time I was completing my education  I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country. There were months  years  I didn't know about it. My family was in a refugee camp. So as soon as I completed my education  I brought my family to America. I wanted them to be safe. But where was my heart  My heart was in Afghanistan. Day after day  when I listened to the news  when I followed what was going on with my country  my heart was breaking up. I really wanted to go back to my country  but at the same time I knew I could not go there  because there was no place for me. I had a good job. I was a professor at a university. I earned good money. I had a good life. My family was here. I could live with them. But I wasn't happy. I wanted to go back home. So I went to the refugee camp. And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan  there were  .  million refugees.  .  million refugees. About    percent of them were women and children. Most of the men have been killed or they were in war. And you know  in the refugee camp  when I went day to day to do a survey  I found things you never could imagine. I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do. I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere  no education  no entertainment  no place to even live. I saw young men that had lost their father and their home  and they are supporting the family as a    to    year old boy    being the head of the household  trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children. So it was a very devastating situation. My heart was beating for my people  and I didn't know what to do. At that moment  we talk about momentum. At that moment  I felt  what can I do for these people  How could I help these people  I am one individual. What can I do for them  But at that moment  I knew that education changed my life. It transformed me. It gave me status. It gave me confidence. It gave me a career. It helped me to support my family  to bring my family to another country  to be safe. And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health  and that's what I went after. But do you think it was easy  No  because at that time  education was banned for girls  completely. And also  by Russia invading Afghanistan  people were not trusting anyone. It was very hard to come and say   I want to do this.  Who am I  Somebody who comes from the United States. Somebody who got educated here. Did they trust me  Of course not. So I really needed to build the trust in this community. How am I going to do that  I went and surveyed and looked and looked. I asked. Finally  I found one man. He was    years old. He was a mullah. I went to his tent in the camp  and I asked him   I want to make you a teacher.  And he looked at me  and he said   Crazy woman  crazy woman  how do you think I can be a teacher   And I told him   I will make you a teacher.  Finally  he accepted my offer  and once I started a class in his compound  the word spread all over. In a matter of one year  we had    schools set up         children going to school  and it was amazing. Thank you. Thank you. But of course  we're doing all our work  we were giving teacher training. We were training women's rights  human rights  democracy  rule of law. We were giving all kinds of training. And one day  I tell you  one day I was in the office in Peshawar  Pakistan. All of a sudden  I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me   Run away  hide   And you know  as a leader  what do you do  You're scared. You know it's dangerous. You know your life is on the line. But as a leader  you have to hold it together. You have to hold it together and show strength. So I said   What's going on   And these people were pouring into my office. So I invited them to the office. They came  and there were nine of them    nine Taliban. They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see. Very mean looking people  black clothes  black turban  and they pour into my office. And I invited them to have a seat and have tea. They said no. They are not going to drink tea. And of course  with the tone of voice they were using  it was very scary  but I was really shaking up. But also I was strong  holding myself up. And  of course  by that time  you know how I dress    I dress from head to toe in a black hijab. The only thing you could see  my eyes. They asked me   What are you doing  Don't you know that school is banned for girls  What are you doing here   And you know  I just looked at them  and I said   What school  Where is the school   And they look at my face  and they said   You are teaching girls here.  I said   This is a house of somebody. We have some students coming  and they are all learning Koran  Holy Book. And you know  Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book  the woman  they can be a good wife  and they can obey their husband.  And I tell you one thing  that's the way you work with those people  and you know    So by that time  they started speaking Pashto. They talked to each other  and they said   Let's go  leave her alone  she's OK.  And you know  this time  I offered them tea again  and they took a sip and they left. By that time  my staff poured into my office. They were scared to death. They didn't know why they didn't kill me. They didn't know why they didn't take me away. But everybody was happy to see me. Very happy  and I was happy to be alive  of course. Of course  I was happy to be alive. But also  as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban    of course during the Taliban there is another story. We went underground and we provided education for    schoolgirls        students underground  and continuously we trained. With the fall of the Taliban  we went into the country  and we opened school after school. We opened women's learning center. We continuously opened clinics. We worked with mothers and children. We had reproductive health training. We had all kinds of training that you can imagine. I was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work. And one day  with four trainers and one bodyguard  I was going up north of Kabul  and all of a sudden  again  I was stopped in the middle of the road by    young men. Rifles on their shoulders  they blocked the road. And I told my driver   What's going on   And the driver said   I don't know.  He asked them. They said   We have nothing to do with you.  They called my name. They said   We want her.  My bodyguard got out  said   I can answer you. What do you want   They said   Nothing.  They called my name. And by that time  the women are yelling and screaming inside the car. I am very shaken up  and I told myself  this is it. This time  we all are going to be killed. There is no doubt in my mind. But still  the moment comes  and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do. It's in your heart. You believe in your worth  and you can walk on it. So I just hold myself on the side of the car. My leg was shaking  and I got outside. And I asked them   What can I do for you   You know what they said to me  They said   We know who you are. We know where you are going. Every day you go up north here and there. You train women  you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job. You build their skills. How about us    And you know  how about us  What are we going to do   I looked at them  and I said   I don't know.  They said   It's OK. The only thing we can do  what we know  from the time we're born  we just hold the gun and kill. That's all we know.  And you know what that means. It's a trap to me  of course. So I walk out of there. They said   We'll let you go  go.  And so I walked into the car  I sit in the car  and I told the driver   Turn around and go back to the office.  At that time  we only were supporting girls. We only had money for women to train them  to send them to school  and nothing else. By the time I came to the office  of course my trainers were gone. They ran away home. Nobody stayed there. My bodyguard was the only one there  and my voice was completely gone. I was shaken up  and I sat on my table  and I said   What am I going to do   How am I going to solve this problem  Because we had training going on up north already. Hundreds of women were there coming to get training. So I was sitting there  all of a sudden  at this moment  talking about momentum  we are  at that moment  one of my wonderful donors called me about a report. And she asked me   Sakena   And I answered her. She said   It's not you. What's wrong with you   I said   Nothing.  I tried to cover. No matter what I tried to do  she didn't believe me  and she asked me again.  OK  tell me what's going on   I told her the whole story. At that time  she said   OK  you go next time  and you will help them. You will help them.  And when  two days later  I went the same route  and do you know  they were not in here  they were a little back further  the same young men  standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car. So we stopped the car. I got out. I said   OK  let's go with me.  And they said   Yes.  I said   On one condition  that whatever I say  you accept it.  And they said  yes  they do. So I took them to the mosque  and to make a long story short  I told them I'd give them teachers. Today  they are the best trainers. They learn English  they learn how to be teachers  they learn computers  and they are my guides. Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas  they go with me. They are ahead  and we go. And they protect us. And    Thank you. That tells you that education transforms people. When you educate people  they are going to be different  and today all over  we need to work for gender equality. We cannot only train women but forget about the men  because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time. So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women  know how much these potential men has  and how much these women can do the same job they are doing. So we are continuously giving training to men  and I really believe strongly. I live in a country that was a beautiful country. I just want to share this with you. It was a beautiful country  beautiful  peaceful country. We were going everywhere. Women were getting education  lawyer  engineer  teacher  and we were going from house to house. We never locked our doors. But you know what happened to my country. Today  people cannot walk out of their door without security issues. But we want the same Afghanistan we had before. And I want to tell you the other side. Today  the women of Afghanistan are working very  very hard. They are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers. They are training to be doctors  back again. They are training to be teachers  and they are running businesses. So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential  and all of this is going to happen. I want to share this with you  because of love  because of compassion  and because of trust and honesty. If you have these few things with you  you will accomplish. We have one poet  Mawl n  R m . He said that by having compassion and having love  you can conquer the world. And I tell you  we could. And if we could do it in Afghanistan  I am sure     percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world. Thank you very  very much. Thank you. Thank you. For the last year  everyone's been watching the same show  and I'm not talking about  Game of Thrones   but a horrifying  real life drama that's proved too fascinating to turn off. It's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via the Internet. Their names have become familiar  James Foley  Steven Sotloff  David Haines  Alan Henning  Peter Kassig  Haruna Yukawa  Kenji Goto Jogo. Their beheadings by the Islamic State were barbaric  but if we think they were archaic  from a remote  obscure age  then we're wrong. They were uniquely modern  because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch. The headlines called them savages and barbarians  because the image of one man overpowering another  killing him with a knife to the throat  conforms to our idea of ancient  primitive practices  the polar opposite of our urban  civilized ways. We don't do things like that. But that's the irony. We think a beheading has nothing to do with us  even as we click on the screen to watch. But it is to do with us. The Islamic State beheadings are not ancient or remote. They're a global    st century event  a   st century event that takes place in our living rooms  at our desks  on our computer screens. They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us. And whether we like it or not  everyone who watches is a part of the show. And lots of people watch. We don't know exactly how many. Obviously  it's difficult to calculate. But a poll taken in the UK  for example  in August       estimated that  .  million people had watched the beheading of James Foley in the few days after it was released. And that's just the first few days  and just Britain. A similar poll taken in the United States in November      found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos  and a further    percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown. Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch  but it's still a very large crowd. And of course that crowd is growing all the time  because every week  every month  more people will keep downloading and keep watching. If we go back    years  before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born  it was a similar story. When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl  Nick Berg  Paul Johnson  were beheaded  those videos were shown during the Iraq War. Nick Berg's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet. Within a day  it was the top search term across search engines like Google  Lycos  Yahoo. In the week after Nick Berg's beheading  these were the top    search terms in the United States. The Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week  and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May  runner up only to  American Idol.  The al Qaeda linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site. One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from         to         every time a beheading in Iraq was shown. He told reporters    months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times  and that's just one website. A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War. Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before  but if we take another step back in history  we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle. As soon as the camera appeared on the scene  a full lifetime ago on June           it had an immediate and unequivocal effect. That day  the first film of a public beheading was created in France. It was the execution  the guillotining  of a German serial killer  Eugen Weidmann  outside the prison Saint Pierre in Versailles. Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn  as was customary at the time  but his executioner was new to the job  and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare. So Weidmann was executed at      in the morning  by which time on a June morning  there was enough light to take photographs  and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event  unbeknownst to the authorities. Several still photographs were taken as well  and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs. The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution was called  unruly  and  disgusting  by the press  but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again  freeze framed in every detail. The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before  but it's not just about the camera. If we take a bigger leap back in history  we'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings  there have been the crowds to see them. In London  as late as the early   th century  there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging. There could be        or        to see a famous criminal killed. And a beheading  which was a rare event in England at the time  attracted even more. In May       five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government. They were hung and then decapitated. It was a gruesome scene. Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd. And         people  that's        more than can fit into Wembley Stadium  had turned out to watch. The streets were packed. People had rented out windows and rooftops. People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street. People climbed lamp posts. People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days. Evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions  the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or  at best  unmoved. Disgust has been comparatively rare  and even when people are disgusted and are horrified  it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch. Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in      of the guillotine  that famous decapitation machine. To us in the   st century  the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption  but to the first crowds who saw it  it was actually a disappointment. They were used to seeing long  drawn out  torturous executions on the scaffold  where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly. To them  watching the guillotine in action  it was so quick  there was nothing to see. The blade fell  the head fell into a basket  out of sight immediately  and they called out   Give me back my gallows  give me back my wooden gallows.  The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal  but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should. All too often  execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony. Today  a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable  but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore. Take  for example  the incidents of suicide baiting. This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves  and people in the crowd shout and jeer   Get on with it  Go on and jump   This is a well recognized phenomenon. One paper in      found that in    out of    threatened suicide attempts  there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd. And there have been incidents reported in the press this year. This was a very widely reported incident in Telford and Shropshire in March this year. And when it happens today  people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online. When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos  the Internet has created a new kind of crowd. Today  the action takes place in a distant time and place  which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening  a sense of separation. It's nothing to do with me. It's already happened. We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Today  we are all offered front row seats. We can all watch in private  in our own time and space  and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch. This sense of separation    from other people  from the event itself    seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch  and there are several ways in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility. Our activities online are often contrasted with real life  as though the things we do online are somehow less real. We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online. There's a sense of anonymity  a sense of invisibility  so we feel less accountable for our behavior. The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently  things that we would usually avoid in everyday life. Today  a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching. Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time. And when the action is pre recorded and takes place in a distant time and space  watching seems like a passive activity. There's nothing I can do about it now. It's already happened. All these things make it easier as an Internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death  to push our personal boundaries  to test our sense of shock  to explore our sense of shock. But we're not passive when we watch. On the contrary  we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen. When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless  he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show. Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle  that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight  when a beheading is staged  when it's essentially a piece of theater  the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs. In other words  watching is very much part of the event. The event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to. Now the event is stretched out in time and place  and everyone who watches plays their part. We should stop watching  but we know we won't. History tells us we won't  and the killers know it too. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you. Let's move here. While they install for the next performance  I want to ask you the question that probably many here have  which is how did you get interested in this topic  Frances Larson  I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford  which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America. People used to say   Oh  the shrunken head museum  the shrunken head museum   And at the time  I was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls. I was working on the cranial collections  and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory  primitive  savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing  and all the while these vast    I mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums  all across Europe and the States    were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality. So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say   Let's look at us.  We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads. Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things. BG  Thank you for sharing that. FL  Thank you. A question I'm often asked is  where did I get my passion for human rights and justice  It started early. I grew up in the west of Ireland  wedged between four brothers  two older than me and two younger than me. So of course I had to be interested in human rights  and equality and justice  and using my elbows  And those issues stayed with me and guided me  and in particular  when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland  from      to     . I dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland  and bringing together communities from Northern Ireland with those from the Republic  trying to build peace. And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II  and also welcomed to my official residence    which we call   ras an Uachtar in   the house of the president    members of the royal family  including  notably  the Prince of Wales. And I was aware that at the time of my presidency  Ireland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress. We were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union. Indeed  when Ireland first joined the European Union in       there were parts of the country that were considered developing  including my own beloved native county  County Mayo. I led trade delegations here to the United States  to Japan  to India  to encourage investment  to help to create jobs  to build up our economy  to build up our health system  our education    our development. What I didn't have to do as president was buy land on mainland Europe  so that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater. What I didn't have to think about  either as president or as a constitutional lawyer  was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change. But that is what President Tong  of the Republic of Kiribati  has to wake up every morning thinking about. He has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy  what he calls   migration with dignity   because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands. As I listened to President Tong describing the situation  I really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face. And as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems  I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt. I thought about her and those who worked with her on the Commission on Human Rights  which she chaired in       and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For them  it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human induced climate change. I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer  and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers. It was because of the impact on people  and the impact on their rights    their rights to food and safe water  health  education and shelter. And I say this with humility  because I came late to the issue of climate change. When I served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from      to       climate change wasn't at the front of my mind. I don't remember making a single speech on climate change. I knew that there was another part of the United Nations    the UN Convention on Climate Change    that was dealing with the issue of climate change. It was later when I started to work in African countries on issues of development and human rights. And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence   Oh  but things are so much worse now  things are so much worse.  And then I explored what was behind that  it was about changes in the climate    climate shocks  changes in the weather. I met Constance Okollet  who had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda  and she told me that when she was growing up  she had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry  they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come  they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest  and so they had enough food. But  in recent years  at the time of this conversation  they had nothing but long periods of drought  and then flash flooding  and then more drought. The school had been destroyed  livelihoods had been destroyed  their harvest had been destroyed. She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together. And this was a reality that really struck me  because of course  Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem. Indeed  I was very struck about the situation in Malawi in January of this year. There was an unprecedented flooding in the country  it covered about a third of the country  over     people were killed  and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods. And the average person in Malawi emits about    kg of CO  a year. The average US citizen emits about   .  metric tons. So those who are suffering disproportionately don't drive cars  don't have electricity  don't consume very significantly  and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of the changes in the climate  the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly  and knowing how to look after their future. I think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly. And I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice because we're not on course for a safe world. Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen  and have repeated it at every conference on climate  that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming above pre Industrial standards. But we're on course for about four degrees. So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet. And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the   st century. And that brought me then to climate justice. Climate justice responds to the moral argument    both sides of the moral argument    to address climate change. First of all  to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected. And secondly  to make sure that they're not left behind again  when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action  as we are doing. In our very unequal world today  it's very striking how many people are left behind. In our world of  .  billion people  about   billion are left behind.  .  billion don't have access to electricity  and they light their homes with kerosene and candles  both of which are dangerous. And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting.  .  billion people cook on open fires    on coal  wood and animal dung. And this causes about   million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation  and of course  most of those who die are women. So we have a very unequal world  and we need to change from  business as usual.  And we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed  because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about       if we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming. And that means we have to leave about two thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground. It's a very big change  and it means that obviously  industrialized countries must cut their emissions  must become much more energy efficient  and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy. For developing countries and emerging economies  the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions  because they must develop  they have very poor populations. So they must develop without emissions  and that is a different kind of problem. Indeed  no country in the world has actually grown without emissions. All the countries have developed with fossil fuels  and then may be moving to renewable energy. So it is a very big challenge  and it requires the total support of the international community  with the necessary finance and technology  and systems and support  because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change. This is an issue that requires complete human solidarity. Human solidarity  if you like  based on self interest    because we are all in this together  and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by     . The good news is that change is happening  and it's happening very fast. Here in California  there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions. In Hawaii  they're passing legislation to have     percent renewable energy by     . And governments are very ambitious around the world. In Costa Rica  they have committed to being carbon neutral by     . In Ethiopia  the commitment is to be carbon neutral by     . Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy. And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power  in order that we can leave the coal in the ground. And that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly. But it's still not enough  and the political will is still not enough. Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati. They actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution  but it would take a lot of political will. President Tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live. This  of course  is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself. It would require great solidarity and support from other countries  and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air. But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory  and be part of the community of nations  That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about. Yes  the challenges of the transformation we need are big  but they can be solved. We are actually  as a people  very capable of coming together to solve problems. I was very conscious of this as I took part this year in commemoration of the   th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in     .      was an extraordinary year. It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems    the devastation of the world wars  particularly the Second World War  the fragile peace that had been brought about  the need for a whole economic regeneration. But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this. They had the capacity  they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem. And they had to build structures for peace and security. And what did we get  What did they achieve  The Charter of the United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutions  as they're called  The World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund. A Marshall Plan for Europe  a devastated Europe  to reconstruct it. And indeed a few years later  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.      is a year that is similar in its importance to       with similar challenges and similar potential. There will be two big summits this year  the first one  in September in New York  is the summit for the sustainable development goals. And then the summit in Paris in December  to give us a climate agreement. The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to live sustainably  in tune with Mother Earth  not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems  but rather  to live in harmony with Mother Earth  by living under sustainable development. And the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on January        . The climate agreement    a binding climate agreement    is needed because of the scientific evidence that we're on a trajectory for about a four degree world and we have to change course to stay below two degrees. So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed  so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions  and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy  so that we have a safe world. The reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the United Nations. It's an issue for all of us  and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum. Indeed  the face of the environmentalist has changed  because of the justice dimension. It's now an issue for faith based organizations  under very good leadership from Pope Francis  and indeed  the Church of England  which is divesting from fossil fuels. It's an issue for the business community  and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly    except for the fossil fuel industries    Even they are beginning to slightly change their language    but only slightly. But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy  but is urging politicians to give them more signals  so that they can move even more rapidly. It's an issue for the trade union movement. It's an issue for the women's movement. It's an issue for young people. I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan  one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit ins  said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people. So  lunch counter moment for young people of the   st century    the sort of real human rights issue of the   st century  because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world. I recall very much the Climate March last September  and that was a huge momentum  not just in New York  but all around the world. and we have to build on that. I was marching with some of The Elders family  and I saw a placard a little bit away from me  but we were wedged so closely together    because after all  there were         people out in the streets of New York    so I couldn't quite get to that placard  I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it  because it said   Angry Grannies   That's what I felt. And I have five grandchildren now  I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren  and I think about their world  and what it will be like when they will share that world with about   billion other people in     . We know that inevitably it will be a climate constrained world  because of the emissions we've already put up there  but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer  and much better for health  and better for jobs and better for energy security  than the world we have now  if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy  and no one is left behind. No one is left behind. And just as we've been looking back this year    in      to       looking back    years    I would like to think that they will look back  that world will look back    years from          years to       and that they will say   Weren't they good to do what they did in       We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference  and that put the world on the right pathway  and we benefit now from that pathway   that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities  we did what was done in      in similar terms  we didn't miss the opportunity  we lived up to our responsibilities. That's what this year is about. And somehow for me  it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much. She was a mentor of mine  she was a friend  she died much too young  she was an extraordinary personality  a great champion of the environment  Wangari Maathai. Wangari said once   In the course of history  there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness  to reach a higher moral ground.  And that's what we have to do. We have to reach a new level of consciousness  a higher moral ground. And we have to do it this year in those two big summits. And that won't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say   We want action now  we want to change course  we want a safe world  a safe world for future generations  a safe world for our children and our grandchildren  and we're all in this together.  Thank you. When I was only three or four  I fell in love with poetry  with the rhythms and the music of language  with the power of metaphor and of imagery  poetry being the essence of communication    the discipline  the distillation. And all these years later  the poems I'll read today are from my just finished seventh book of poetry. Well  five years ago  I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Though there's no cure yet  advances in treatment are really impressive. But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials  despite gender specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men    who happen to have different reproductive systems. Gender specific medicine is good for men  too. But you bring to a crisis the person you already are  including the  yes  momentum that you've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action  both of which require but also create energy. So as an activist  I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation    that's pdf.org    to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map. And as a poet  I began working with this subject matter  finding it tragic  hilarious  sometimes even joyful. I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's  I feel distilled by it  and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.  No Signs of Struggle  Growing small requires enormity of will  just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out  watching it stoop  stare at you while you try not to look. Rare is an exchange  a smile of brief  wry recognition. You are the new kid on the block. Everyone here was you once. You are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can't fit into yet  acceptance of irritating help from those who love you  giving way and over  but not up. You've swallowed hard the contents of the  Drink Me  bottle  and felt yourself shrink. Now  familiar furniture looms  floors tilt  and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands. It demands colossal patience  all this growing small  your diminished sleep at night  your handwriting  your voice  your height. You are more the incredible shrinking woman than the Buddhist mystic  serene  making do with less. Less is not always more. Yet in this emptying space  space glimmers  becoming visible. Here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment. It is a place of merciless poetry  a gift of presence previously ignored  drowned in the daily clutter. Here every gesture needs intention  is alive with consciousness. Nothing is automatic. You can spot it in the provocation of a button  an arm poking at a sleeve  a balancing act at a night time curb while negotiating the dark. Feats of such modest valor  who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate  fierce discipline  a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware  Such understated power here  in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant. Such quiet beauty here  in these  my soft voiced  stiff limbed people  such resolve masked by each placid face. There is immensity required in growing small  so bent on such unbending grace. Thank you. This one is called  On Donating My Brain to Science.  Not a problem. Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people. Already a universal donor  kidneys  corneas  liver  lungs  tissue  heart  veins  whatever. Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research  maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have. Flattering  that. So fill in the forms  drill through the answers  trill out a blithe spirit. And slice me  dice me  spread me on your slides. Find what I'm trying to tell you. Earn me  learn me  scan me  squint through your lens. Uncover what I'd hint at if I could. Be my guest  do your best  harvest me  track the clues. This was a good brain while alive. This was a brain that paid its dues. So slice me  dice me  smear me on your slides  stain me  explain me  drain me like a cup. Share me  hear me  I want to be used I want to be used I want to be used up. And this one's called  The Ghost Light.  Lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter. Some life forms    certain mushrooms  snails  jellyfish  worms    glow bioluminescent  and people as well  we emit infra red light from our most lucent selves. Our tragedy is we can't see it. We see by reflecting. We need biofluorescence to show our true colors. External illumination can distort  though. When gravity bends light  huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes  elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs    a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine. A glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard's part  as if  besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble  I could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk on stare. Stare as long as you need to. If you think about it  walking  even standing  is illogical    such tiny things  feet     especially when one's body is not al dente anymore. Besides  creature of extremes and excess  I've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring  and a bit of a dumb blonde. Dionysians don't do balance. Balance  in other words  has never been my strong point. But I digress. More and more these days  digression seems the most direct route through from where I've lost or found myself out of place  mind  turn  time. Place your foot just so  mind how you turn  too swift a swivel can bring you down. Take your time ushering the audience out  saying goodbye to the actors. The ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater. In the empty theater of such a night  waking to meet no external radiance  this is the final struggle left to win  this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin  this the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin  lit from within. And this is the last one.  This Dark Hour  Late summer    A.M. The rain slows to a stop  dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark. Barefoot  careful on the slick slate slabs  I need no light  I know the way  stoop by the mint bed  scoop a fistful of moist earth  then grope for a chair  spread a shawl  and sit  breathing in the wet green August air. This is the small  still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade  the phone shrills  the computer screen blinks and glares awake. There is this hour  poem in my head  soil in my hand  unnamable fullness. This hour  when blood of my blood bone of bone  child grown to manhood now    stranger  intimate  not distant but apart    lies safe  off dreaming melodies while love sleeps  safe  in his arms. To have come to this place  lived to this moment  immeasurable lightness. The density of black starts to blur umber. Tentative  a cardinal's coloratura  then the mourning dove's elegy. Sable glimmers toward grey  objects emerge  trailing shadows  night ages toward day. The city stirs. There will be other dawns  nights  gaudy noons. Likely  I'll lose my way. There will be stumbling  falling  cursing the dark. Whatever comes  there was this hour when nothing mattered  all was unbearably dear. And when I'm done with daylights  should those who loved me grieve too long a while  let them remember that I had this hour    this dark  perfect hour    and smile. Thank you. In the year       a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life. Her doctor was called Alois. Alois didn't know how to help Auguste  but he watched over her until  sadly  she passed away in     . After she died  Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain    the likes of which he'd never seen before. Now here's the even more striking thing. If Auguste had instead been alive today  we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to     years ago. Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. Since       medicine has advanced greatly. We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections  many treatments for cancer  antiretrovirals for HIV  statins for heart disease and much more. But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease. I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. So I think about this all the time. Alzheimer's now affects    million people worldwide. But by       it will affect     million people    which  by the way  will include many of you. If you're hoping to live to be    or older  your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two. In other words  odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's. Already in the United States alone  Alzheimer's care costs     billion dollars every year. One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. It is today the most expensive disease  and costs are projected to increase fivefold by       as the baby boomer generation ages. It may surprise you that  put simply  Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. But we've done relatively little to address it. Today  of the top    causes of death worldwide  Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent  cure or even slow down. We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. The US government spends    times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer. The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause  a lack of awareness. Because here's what few people know but everyone should  Alzheimer's is a disease  and we can cure it. For most of the past     years  everyone  including scientists  mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging. We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old. But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities  the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal. Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. For almost a century  we didn't know much about these. Today we know they're made from protein molecules. You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami. There are spots on the paper that are sticky. And when it folds correctly  these sticky bits end up on the inside. But sometimes things go wrong  and some sticky bits are on the outside. This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other  forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles. That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. We've spent the past    years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works. There are many steps  and identifying which step to try to block is complex    like defusing a bomb. Cutting one wire might do nothing. Cutting others might make the bomb explore. We have to find the right step to block  and then create a drug that does it. Until recently  we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best. But now we've got together a diverse group of people    medics  biologists  geneticists  chemists  physicists  engineers and mathematicians. And together  we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease. Now let me show you some of our latest results. No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms. So these are healthy worms  and you can see they're moving around normally. These worms  on the other hand  have protein molecules sticking together inside them    like humans with Alzheimer's. And you can see they're clearly sick. But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage  then we see that they're healthy  and they live a normal lifespan. This is just an initial positive result  but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure. After     years of waiting  there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next    or    years. But to grow that hope  to finally beat Alzheimer's  we need help. This isn't about scientists like me    it's about you. We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try  we can beat it. In the case of other diseases  patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments  the pharmaceutical industry  scientists and regulators. That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late     s. Today  we see that same drive to beat cancer. But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves. And their families  the hidden victims  caring for their loved ones night and day  are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change. So  it really is down to you. Alzheimer's isn't  for the most part  a genetic disease. Everyone with a brain is at risk. Today  there are    million patients like Auguste  who can't create the change they need for themselves. Help speak up for them  and help demand a cure. Thank you. Last year  I went on my first book tour. In    months  I flew to    countries and gave some hundred talks. Every talk in every country began with an introduction  and every introduction began  alas  with a lie   Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria   or  Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States.  Whenever I heard this opening sentence  no matter the country that concluded it    England  America  Ghana  Nigeria    I thought   But that's not true.  Yes  I was born in England and grew up in the United States. My mum  born in England  and raised in Nigeria  currently lives in Ghana. My father was born in Gold Coast  a British colony  raised in Ghana  and has lived for over    years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this reason  my introducers also called me  multinational.   But Nike is multinational   I thought   I'm a human being.  Then  one fine day  mid tour  I went to Louisiana  a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the role of locality in writing  when suddenly it hit me. I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all. How could I come from a nation  How can a human being come from a concept  It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades. From newspapers  textbooks  conversations  I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal  singular  naturally occurring things  but I wondered  to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute  some fixed point in place in time  a constant thing  but was it  In my lifetime  countries had disappeared    Czechoslovakia  appeared    Timor Leste  failed    Somalia. My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born. To me  a country    this thing that could be born  die  expand  contract    hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being. And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state. What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood  an idea that came into fashion only     years ago. When I learned this  beginning my masters degree in international relations  I felt a sort of surge of relief. It was as I had suspected. History was real  cultures were real  but countries were invented. For the next    years  I sought to re  or un define myself  my world  my work  my experience  beyond the logic of the state. In       I wrote an essay   What is an Afropolitan   sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country. It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience  and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.  How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana   one such critic asked   when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport   Now  if I'm honest  I knew just what she meant. I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana. Her parents are third generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent. Layla  who speaks fluent Twi  knows Accra like the back of her hand  but when we first met years ago  I thought   She's not from Ghana.  In my mind  she came from Lebanon  despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra. I  like my critics  was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports. I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets    the privileging of a fiction  the singular country  over reality  human experience. Speaking with Colum McCann that day  the penny finally dropped.  All experience is local   he said.  All identity is experience   I thought.  I'm not a national   I proclaimed onstage.  I'm a local. I'm multi local.  See   Taiye Selasi comes from the United States   isn't the truth. I have no relationship with the United States  all    of them  not really. My relationship is with Brookline  the town where I grew up  with New York City  where I started work  with Lawrenceville  where I spend Thanksgiving. What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent  but these very particular experiences and the places they occur. Despite my pride in Ewe culture  the Black Stars  and my love of Ghanaian food  I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana  writ large. My relationship is with Accra  where my mother lives  where I go each year  with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours. These are the places that shape my experience. My experience is where I'm from. What if we asked  instead of  Where are you from       Where are you a local   This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are. Tell me you're from France  and I see what  a set of clich s  Adichie's dangerous single story  the myth of the nation of France  Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris  better yet  Goutte d'Or  and I see a set of experiences. Our experience is where we're from. So  where are you a local  I propose a three step test. I call these the three  R s   rituals  relationships  restrictions. First  think of your daily rituals  whatever they may be  making your coffee  driving to work  harvesting your crops  saying your prayers. What kind of rituals are these  Where do they occur  In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face  As a child  I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston  with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos. We took off our shoes in the house  we were unfailingly polite with our elders  we ate slow cooked  spicy food. In snowy North America  ours were rituals of the global South. The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy  I was shocked by how at home I felt. The rituals were familiar.  R  number one  rituals. Now  think of your relationships  of the people who shape your days. To whom do you speak at least once a week  be it face to face or on FaceTime  Be reasonable in your assessment  I'm not talking about your Facebook friends. I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience. My mother in Accra  my twin sister in Boston  my best friends in New York  these relationships are home for me.  R  number two  relationships. We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships  but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions. By restrictions  I mean  where are you able to live  What passport do you hold  Are you restricted by  say  racism  from feeling fully at home where you live  By civil war  dysfunctional governance  economic inflation  from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child  This is the least sexy of the R s  less lyric than rituals and relationships  but the question takes us past  Where are you now   to  Why aren't you there  and why   Rituals  relationships  restrictions. Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns  then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can. A very different picture of your life in local context  of your identity as a set of experiences  may emerge. So let's try it. I have a friend named Olu. He's    years old. His parents  born in Nigeria  came to Germany on scholarships. Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age   . When his family moved to Lagos  he studied in London  then came to Berlin. He loves going to Nigeria    the weather  the food  the friends    but hates the political corruption there. Where is Olu from  I have another friend named Udo. He's also    years old. Udo was born in C rdoba  in northwest Argentina  where his grandparents migrated from Germany  what is now Poland  after the war. Udo studied in Buenos Aires  and nine years ago came to Berlin. He loves going to Argentina     the weather  the food  the friends    but hates the economic corruption there. Where is Udo from  With his blonde hair and blue eyes  Udo could pass for German  but holds an Argentinian passport  so needs a visa to live in Berlin. That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history. That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin  that has to do with life. Olu  who looks Nigerian  needs a visa to visit Nigeria. He speaks Yoruba with an English accent  and English with a German one. To claim that he's  not really Nigerian   though  denies his experience in Lagos  the rituals he practiced growing up  his relationship with family and friends. Meanwhile  though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes  Olu always feels restricted there  not least by the fact that he's gay. Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries  from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur. To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience. Their rituals  their relationships  and their restrictions are the same. Of course  when we ask   Where are you from   we're using a kind of shorthand. It's quicker to say  Nigeria  than  Lagos and Berlin   and as with Google Maps  we can always zoom in closer  from country to city to neighborhood. But that's not quite the point. The difference between  Where are you from   and  Where are you a local   isn't the specificity of the answer  it's the intention of the question. Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs. Even that most glorious expression of countryhood  the World Cup  gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players. As a unit of measurement for human experience  the country doesn't quite work. That's why Olu says   I'm German  but my parents come from Nigeria.  The  but  in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units  one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.  I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin   suggests overlapping experiences  layers that merge together  that can't be denied or removed. You can take away my passport  but you can't take away my experience. That I carry within me. Where I'm from comes wherever I go. To be clear  I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries. There's much to be said for national history  more for the sovereign state. Culture exists in community  and community exists in context. Geography  tradition  collective memory  these things are important. What I'm questioning is primacy. All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation  as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was. What are we really seeking  though  when we ask where someone comes from  And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer  Here's one possibility  basically  countries represent power.  Where are you from   Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power. America. Germany. Japan. More power. China. Russia. Ambiguous. It's possible that without realizing it  we're playing a power game  especially in the context of multi ethnic countries. As any recent immigrant knows  the question  Where are you from   or  Where are you really from   is often code for  Why are you here   Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges.  Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan    never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers.  I'm with him. To call one student American  another Pakistani  then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu. The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum. A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies. Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them. I'm often asked if I plan to  go back  to Ghana. I go to Accra every year  but I can't  go back  to Ghana. It's not because I wasn't born there. My father can't go back  either. The country in which he was born  that country no longer exists. We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it. Something  somewhere will always have changed  most of all  ourselves. People. Finally  what we're talking about is human experience  this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair. In creative writing  locality bespeaks humanity. The more we know about where a story is set  the more local color and texture  the more human the characters start to feel  the more relatable  not less. The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories. In fact  all of us are multi    multi local  multi layered. To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together  I think  not further apart. So the next time that I'm introduced  I'd love to hear the truth   Taiye Selasi is a human being  like everybody here. She isn't a citizen of the world  but a citizen of worlds. She is a local of New York  Rome and Accra.  Thank you. So I've had the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places  photographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures all over the world. I love my job. But people think it's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows  when in reality  it looks more something like this. This is my office. We can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night  so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors. As long as we can stay dry  that's a bonus. We also can't afford the fanciest restaurants. So we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu. And if you're in the Ecuadorian P ramo  you're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy. But what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments  and those times of despair  we think   Hey  there might be an image to be made here  there might be a story to be told.  And why is storytelling important  Well  it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage. And in the Southeast  there's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place. We're visual creatures  so we use what we see to teach us what we know. Now the majority of us aren't going to willingly go way down to a swamp. So how can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection  We can't. So my job  then  is to use photography as a communication tool  to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics  to get people talking  to get them thinking  and to hopefully  ultimately  get them caring. I started doing this    years ago right here in Gainesville  right here in my backyard. And I fell in love with adventure and discovery  going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep. There are a lot of beautiful places to find. Despite all these years that have passed  I still see the world through the eyes of a child and I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as I can. And we're pretty lucky because here in the South  we're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences. It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us. See  a lot of people look at this and they say   Oh yeah  wow  that's a pretty tree.  But I don't just see a tree    I look at this and I see opportunity. I see an entire weekend. Because when I was a kid  these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore  dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have. And folks  I've been photographing all over the world and I promise you  what we have here in the South  what we have in the Sunshine State  rivals anything else that I've seen. But yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things. Before most kids are     they'll have been to Disney World more times than they've been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky. And I have nothing against Disney or Mickey  I used to go there  too. But they're missing out on those fundamental connections that create a real sense of pride and ownership for the place that they call home. And this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky. When our ancestors first came here  they warned   Stay out of these areas  they're haunted. They're full of evil spirits and ghosts.  I don't know where they came up with that idea. But it's actually led to a very real disconnect  a very real negative mentality that has kept the public disinterested  silent  and ultimately  our environment at risk. We're a state that's surrounded and defined by water  and yet for centuries  swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome. And so we've treated them as these second class ecosystems  because they have very little monetary value and of course  they're known to harbor alligators and snakes    which  I'll admit  these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors. So it became assumed  then  that the only good swamp was a drained swamp. And in fact  draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago. But now we're backpedaling  because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes  the more secrets we're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats  watersheds and flyways. Take this bird  for example  this is the prothonotary warbler. I love this bird because it's a swamp bird  through and through  a swamp bird. They nest and they mate and they breed in these old growth swamps in these flooded forests. And so after the spring  after they raise their young  they then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico into Central and South America. And then after the winter  the spring rolls around and they come back. They fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico. And where do they go  Where do they land  Right back in the same tree. That's nuts. This is a bird the size of a tennis ball    I mean  that's crazy  I used a GPS to get here today  and this is my hometown. It's crazy. So what happens  then  when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back  and it comes back to this  a freshly sodded golf course  This is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling here in this state. And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years and we're just now learning about it. So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first. Now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps  they still have a bad name. Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading into Florida's blackwater. I can understand that. But what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State is that for so many of us  we live with this latent but very palpable fear that when we put our toes into the water  there might be something much more ancient and much more adapted than we are. Knowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort  I think. How often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable  or consider that the world may not have been made for just us  So for the last decade  I began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest and the pines turn to cypress  and I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles  all these discomforts  as affirmations that I'd found true wilderness  and I embrace them wholly. Now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater  it's only fitting that I'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all  the Everglades. Growing up here in North Central Florida  it always had these enchanted names  places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee  Corkscrew  Big Cypress. I started what turned into a five year project to hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light  in a more inspired light. But I knew this would be a tall order  because here you have an area that's roughly a third the size the state of Florida  it's huge. And when I say Everglades  most people are like   Oh  yeah  the national park.  But the Everglades is not just a park  it's an entire watershed  starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north  and then as the rains would fall in the summer  these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee  and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward  ever slowly  with the topography  and get into the river of grass  the Sawgrass Prairies  before meting into the cypress slews  until going further south into the mangrove swamps  and then finally    finally    reaching Florida Bay  the emerald gem of the Everglades  the great estuary  the     square mile estuary. So sure  the national park is the southern end of this system  but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in  the fresh water that starts     miles north. So no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water. And unfortunately  that's precisely what we've done. Over the last    years  we have drained  we have dammed  we have dredged the Everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today. So this story is not all sunshine and rainbows  unfortunately. For better or for worse  the story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship with the natural world. But I'll show you these beautiful pictures  because it gets you on board. And while I have your attention  I can tell you the real story. It's that we're taking this  and we're trading it for this  at an alarming rate. And what's lost on so many people is the sheer scale of which we're discussing. Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for   million Floridians  today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year round tomatoes and oranges for over     million Americans. And it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built the river of grass       years ago. Ironically  today  it's also responsible for the over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane. These are the same fields that are responsible for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed  forever changing the system. But in order for you to not just understand how this system works  but to also get personally connected to it  I decided to break the story down into several different narratives. And I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee  the beating heart of the Everglade system. And to do that  I picked an ambassador  an iconic species. This is the Everglade snail kite. It's a great bird  and they used to nest in the thousands  thousands in the northern Everglades. And then they've gone down to about     nesting pairs today. And why is that  Well  it's because they eat one source of food  an apple snail  about the size of a ping pong ball  an aquatic gastropod. So as we started damming up the Everglades  as we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands  we lost the habitat for the snail. And thus  the population of the kites declined. And so  I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship between wetland  snail and bird  but I also wanted a photo that would communicate how incredible this relationship was  and how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other  this healthy wetland and this bird. And to do that  I brainstormed this idea. I started sketching out these plans to make a photo  and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee    this is an endangered bird  so it takes special permission to do. So I built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water. And I spent months planning this crazy idea. And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee and I spent over a week in the water  wading waist deep    hour shifts from dawn until dusk  to get one image that I thought might communicate this. And here's the day that it finally worked   Video   Mac Stone narrating  After setting up the platform  I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails. And I see him scanning and searching. And he gets right over the trap  and I see that he's seen it. And he beelines  he goes straight for the trap. And in that moment  all those months of planning  waiting  all the sunburn  mosquito bites    suddenly  they're all worth it. You can believe how excited I was when that happened. But what the idea was  is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it  these photos  these new perspectives  will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible  so valuable  so important. Now  I know I can't come here to Gainesville and talk to you about animals in the Everglades without talking about gators. I love gators  I grew up loving gators. My parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators. But what I like about them is  they're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks. They're feared  they're hated  and they are tragically misunderstood. Because these are a unique species  they're not just apex predators. In the Everglades  they are the very architects of the Everglades  because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season  they start excavating these holes called gator holes. And they do this because as the water drops down  they'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage. And now this isn't just affecting them  other animals also depend on this relationship  so they become a keystone species as well. So how do you make an apex predator  an ancient reptile  at once look like it dominates the system  but at the same time  look vulnerable  Well  you wade into a pit of about     of them  then you hope that you've made the right decision. I still have all my fingers  it's cool. But I understand  I know I'm not going to rally you guys  I'm not going to rally the troops to  Save the Everglades for the gators   It won't happen because they're so ubiquitous  we see them now  they're one of the great conservation success stories of the US. But there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are  you can't help but love  too  and that's the roseate spoonbill. These birds are great  but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades  because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay  and at the turn of the   th century  they got down to two    two nesting pairs. And why  That's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky. Then we banned the plume trade  and their numbers started rebounding. And as their numbers started rebounding  scientists began to pay attention  they started studying these birds. And what they found out is that these birds' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw down cycle of water in the Everglades  the thing that defines the Everglades watershed. What they found out is that these birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down  because they're tactile feeders  so they have to touch whatever they eat. And so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish to be able to feed enough to feed their young. So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades    an indicator species of the overall health of the system. And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid   th century    shooting up to                             just as that started happening  we started draining the southern Everglades. And we stopped two thirds of that water from moving south. And it had drastic consequences. And just as those numbers started reaching their peak  unfortunately  today  the real spoonbill story  the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this. And we're down to less than    nesting pairs in Florida Bay today  because we've disrupted the system so much. So all these different organizations are shouting  they're screaming   The Everglades is fragile  It's fragile   It is not. It is resilient. Because despite all we've taken  despite all we've done and we've drained and we've dammed and we've dredged it  pieces of it are still here  waiting to be put back together. And this is what I've loved about South Florida  that in one place  you have this unstoppable force of mankind meeting the immovable object of tropical nature. And it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal. What is wilderness worth  What is the value of biodiversity  or our drinking water  And fortunately  after decades of debate  we're finally starting to act on those questions. We're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay. But it's up to us as citizens  as residents  as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises. What can you do to help  It's so easy. Just get outside  get out there. Take your friends out  take your kids out  take your family out. Hire a fishing guide. Show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense  but economic sense as well. It's a lot of fun  just do it    put your feet in the water. The swamp will change you  I promise. Over the years  we've been so generous with these other landscapes around the country  cloaking them with this American pride  places that we now consider to define us  Grand Canyon  Yosemite  Yellowstone. And we use these parks and these natural areas as beacons and as cultural compasses. And sadly  the Everglades is very commonly left out of that conversation. But I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic of who we are as a country as any of these other wildernesses. It's just a different kind of wild. But I'm encouraged  because maybe we're finally starting to come around  because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland  today is a World Heritage site. It's a wetland of international importance. And we've come a long way in the last    years. And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project  the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State. Because if we can heal this system  it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world. But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to. They say that the Everglades is our greatest test. If we pass it  we get to keep the planet. I love that quote  because it's a challenge  it's a prod. Can we do it  Will we do it  We have to  we must. But the Everglades is not just a test. It's also a gift  and ultimately  our responsibility. Thank you. Imagine being unable to say   I am hungry    I am in pain    thank you   or  I love you.  Being trapped inside your body  a body that doesn't respond to commands. Surrounded by people  yet utterly alone. Wishing you could reach out  to connect  to comfort  to participate. For    long years  that was my reality. Most of us never think twice about talking  about communicating. I've thought a lot about it. I've had a lot of time to think. For the first    years of my life  I was a normal  happy  healthy little boy. Then everything changed. I contracted a brain infection. The doctors weren't sure what it was  but they treated me the best they could. However  I progressively got worse. Eventually  I lost my ability to control my movements  make eye contact  and finally  my ability to speak. While in hospital  I desperately wanted to go home. I said to my mother   When home   Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice. I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness. My parents were told I was as good as not there. A vegetable  having the intelligence of a three month old baby. They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until I died. My parents  in fact my entire family's lives  became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how. Their friends drifted away. One year turned to two  two turned to three. It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear. The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away. I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one. I had become a ghost  a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved. Meanwhile  my mind began knitting itself back together. Gradually  my awareness started to return. But no one realized that I had come back to life. I was aware of everything  just like any normal person. I could see and understand everything  but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know. My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body  a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis. The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself  totally alone. I was trapped with only my thoughts for company. I would never be rescued. No one would ever show me tenderness. I would never talk to a friend. No one would ever love me. I had no dreams  no hope  nothing to look forward to. Well  nothing pleasant. I lived in fear  and  to put it bluntly  was waiting for death to finally release me  expecting to die all alone in a care home. I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words what it's like not to be able to communicate. Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted  stifled and muted within you. For me  the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness. I simply existed. It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense  you have vanished. Other people controlled every aspect of my life. They decided what I ate and when. Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair. I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV watching Barney reruns. I think because Barney is so happy and jolly  and I absolutely wasn't  it made it so much worse. I was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people's perceptions of me. I was a silent  invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching. Unfortunately  I wasn't only an observer. With no way to communicate  I became the perfect victim  a defenseless object  seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires. For more than    years  people who were charged with my care abused me physically  verbally and sexually. Despite what they thought  I did feel. The first time it happened  I was shocked and filled with disbelief. How could they do this to me  I was confused. What had I done to deserve this  Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight. Hurt  sadness and anger flooded through me. I felt worthless. There was no one to comfort me. But neither of my parents knew this was happening. I lived in terror  knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when. All I knew was that I would never be the same. I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing   No matter what they take from me  they can't take away my dignity.  And I thought to myself   You want to bet   Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped. But the years of constant caretaking  having to wake up every two hours to turn me  combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son  had taken a toll on my mother and father. Following yet another heated argument between my parents  in a moment of despair and desperation  my mother turned to me and told me that I should die. I was shocked  but as I thought about what she had said  I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother  yet I could do nothing about it. There were many moments when I gave up  sinking into a dark abyss. I remember one particularly low moment. My dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store. A random stranger walked past  looked at me and he smiled. I may never know why  but that simple act  the fleeting moment of human connection  transformed how I was feeling  making me want to keep going. My existence was tortured by monotony  a reality that was often too much to bear. Alone with my thoughts  I constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor. I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were. As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed  I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home. Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day. My mind became a tool that I could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies. I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life. But I had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves  and in my place was the person people expected me to be. To some I was Martin  a vacant shell  the vegetable  deserving of harsh words  dismissal and even abuse. To others  I was the tragically brain damaged boy who had grown to become a man. Someone they were kind to and cared for. Good or bad  I was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected. It took someone new to see me in a different way. An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week. Whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice  she became convinced that I could understand what was being said. She urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication. And within a year  I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate. It was exhilarating  but frustrating at times. I had so many words in my mind  that I couldn't wait to be able to share them. Sometimes  I would say things to myself simply because I could. In myself  I had a ready audience  and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes  others would listen  too. But as I began to communicate more  I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself. I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in. I stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies. As simple as this may sound  it was amazing. My new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening. I was like a man child  and as liberating as it often was  I struggled. I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads. While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair. I realized that some people would only listen to me if what I said was in line with what they expected. Otherwise  it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best. I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message. It is about getting the message heard and respected. Still  things were going well. My body was slowly getting stronger. I had a job in computing that I loved  and had even got Kojak  the dog I had been dreaming about for years. However  I longed to share my life with someone. I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work  thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to. Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life  I met Joan. Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me  but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself. Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me. However  after all I had been through  I still couldn't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who I am. I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man. The first time someone referred to me as a man  it stopped me in my tracks. I felt like looking around and asking   Who  me   That all changed with Joan. We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly. I felt safe  and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought. I started to feel whole again  a man worthy of love. I began to reshape my destiny. I spoke up a little more at work. I asserted my need for independence to the people around me. Being given a means of communication changed everything. I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those I had of myself. Communication is what makes us human  enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us    telling our own stories  expressing wants  needs and desires  or hearing those of others by really listening. All this is how the world knows who we are. So who are we without it  True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world. Once  I was perceived to be an inanimate object  a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today  I am so much more. A husband  a son  a friend  a brother  a business owner  a first class honors graduate  a keen amateur photographer. It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this. We are told that actions speak louder than words. But I wonder  do they  Our words  however we communicate them  are just as powerful. Whether we speak the words with our own voices  type them with our eyes  or communicate them non verbally to someone who speaks them for us  words are among our most powerful tools. I have come to you through a terrible darkness  pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself. The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light. We are shining here together. If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating  it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude. It all sounds the same. But if you will  please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can  Thank you. Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   Now if you had to guess  how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question  You can just hold up fingers. Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK. Now  raise your hand if the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   has ever caused you any anxiety. Any anxiety at all. I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   See  the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests    it's that I had too many. In high school  I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe you've heard of us. This continued after high school  and at a certain point  I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in  become all consumed  and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was  and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try and persist anyway  because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But eventually this sense of boredom  this feeling of  like  yeah  I got this  this isn't challenging anymore    it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go. But then I would become interested in something else  something totally unrelated  and I would dive into that  and become all consumed  and I'd be like   Yes  I found my thing   and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored. And eventually  I would let it go. But then I would discover something new and totally different  and I would dive into that. This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety  for two reasons. The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career. I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing  deny all of my other passions  and just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal. I worried that there was something wrong with this  and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was afraid of commitment  or that I was scattered  or that I was self sabotaging  afraid of my own success. If you can relate to my story and to these feelings  I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you where you learned it  you learned it from the culture. We are first asked the question  What do you want to be when you grow up   when we're about five years old. And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age. It's considered an innocuous question  posed to little kids to elicit cute replies  like   I want to be an astronaut   or  I want to be a ballerina   or  I want to be a pirate.  Insert Halloween costume here. But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms    for instance  high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college. And at some point   What do you want to be when you grow up   goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why  See  while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be  it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be. In fact  it does just the opposite  because when someone asks you what you want to be  you can't reply with    different things  though well meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like   Oh  how cute  but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose.  This is Dr. Bob Childs    and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng  a magazine editor turned illustrator  entrepreneur  teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear about people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling  the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth  and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it. But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way  What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about  and many different things you want to do  Well  there is no room for someone like you in this framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't have a purpose. And you might feel like there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you. What you are is a multipotentialite. A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful to say. It might help if you break it up into three parts  multi  potential  and ite. You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea  such as polymath  the Renaissance person. Actually  during the Renaissance period  it was considered the ideal to be well versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as  scanners.  Use whichever term you like  or invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community  we cannot agree on a single identity. It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome. But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website  is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way. Here are three multipotentialite super powers. One  idea synthesis. That is  combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography  data visualization  travel  mathematics and design  when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically inspired jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite  but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites  with all of their backgrounds  are able to access a lot of these points of intersection. The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. When multipotentialites become interested in something  we go hard. We observe everything we can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners  because we've been beginners so many times in the past  and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more  many skills are transferable across disciplines  and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue  so we're rarely starting from scratch. Nora Dunn is a full time traveler and freelance writer. As a child concert pianist  she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now  she's the fastest typist she knows. Before becoming a writer  Nora was a financial planner. She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice  and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to  even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely  in a way that you couldn't have anticipated. The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability  that is  the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director  sometimes a web designer  sometimes a Kickstarter consultant  sometimes a teacher  and sometimes  apparently  James Bond. He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles  depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the   st century. The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive. Idea synthesis  rapid learning and adaptability  three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at  and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus. As a society  we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex  multidimensional problems in the world right now  and we need creative  out of the box thinkers to tackle them. Now  let's say that you are  in your heart  a specialist. You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. Don't worry    there's nothing wrong with you  either. In fact  some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together. The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas  while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly  multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers. So with that said  if there is one thing you take away from this talk  I hope that it is this  embrace your inner wiring  whatever that may be. If you're a specialist at heart  then by all means  specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the multipotentialites in the room  including those of you who may have just realized in the last    minutes that you are one    to you I say  embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes. Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier  more authentic life. And perhaps more importantly    multipotentialites  the world needs us. Thank you. Over our lifetimes  we've all contributed to climate change. Actions  choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And I think that that's quite a powerful thought. But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to  how often and how  about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces  or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy. But we can also turn that thought on its head  and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already  then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to. So we have a choice. We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously  and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions  and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future. Alternatively  we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem. But if we do that  we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future. And not only that. As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions  we're making that choice on behalf of others as well. But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future. Over the last two decades  our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change  and they've been focused on avoiding a two degree centigrade warming above pre industrial levels. That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators  to humans and to the environment. So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change. But dangerous climate change can be subjective. So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world  and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure  where there are people that are well insured and so on  then that impact can be disruptive. It can cause upset  it could cause cost. It could even cause some deaths. But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure  or where people are not well insured  or they're not having good support networks  then that same climate change impact could be devastating. It could cause a significant loss of home  but it could also cause significant amounts of death. So this is a graph of the CO  emissions at the left hand side from fossil fuel and industry  and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day. And what's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially. If we focus in on a shorter period of time from       we have established in      the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  the Rio Earth Summit in       then rolling on a few years  in      we had the Copenhagen Accord  where it established avoiding a two degree temperature rise in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity. And then in       we had the Rio    event. And all the way through  during all of these meetings and many others as well  emissions have continued to rise. And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years  and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy  then we are much more on track for a four degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two degree centigrade. Now  let's just pause for a moment and think about this four degree global average temperature. Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea. Now  because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land  the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea. The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures. We experience hot days  cold days  rainy days  especially if you live in Manchester like me. So now put yourself in a city center. Imagine somewhere in the world  Mumbai  Beijing  New York  London. It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced. There's sun beating down  there's concrete and glass all around you. Now imagine that same day    but it's six  eight  maybe    to    degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave. That's the kind of thing we're going to experience under a four degree global average temperature scenario. And the problem with these extremes  and not just the temperature extremes  but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts  is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events. So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world. And this is going to be extremely challenged. Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient. And our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range. And this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four degree type scenario. Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this. So if we go back  also thinking about four degrees  it's not just the direct impacts  but also some indirect impacts. So if we take food security  for example. Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to    percent lower under a four degree scenario  rice up to    percent lower. This will be absolutely devastating for global food security. So all in all  the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living. So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees. Is it reasonable still to focus on the two degree path  There are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it's now too late to avoid a two degree warming. But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems  on food systems  aviation and also shipping  just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two degree dangerous climate change. But we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it. So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs  the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four degree pathway to the two degree green pathway is immediate. And that's because of cumulative emissions  or the carbon budget. So in other words  because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now  the CO  that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption lasts a very long time. Some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century  maybe much longer. It will accumulate  and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative. And that tells us something about these trajectories. First of all  it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter  not where we reach at a particular date in future. And that's important  because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of       just in the nick of time to sort things out. Because in the meantime  emissions will have accumulated. So if we continue on this red  four degree centigrade scenario pathway  the longer we continue on it  that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget  to keep the same area under the curve  which means that that trajectory  the red one there  becomes steeper. So in other words  if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term  then we'll have to make more significant year on year emission reductions. We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system. But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term  then we will have to do that even sooner. So this poses really big challenges for us. The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy. If you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high  it points us towards reducing energy demand. And that's because with all the will in the world  the large scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time. So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage  upscale our biofuel production  or go for a much bigger roll out of wind turbines and wave turbines. All of that will take time. So because it's the area under the curve that matters  we need to focus on energy efficiency  but also on energy conservation    in other words  using less energy. And if we do that  that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply side technology  we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption  because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side. Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well being and equity. There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise. Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel  as those economies grow so will emissions. And now  if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget  that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise  then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce. So that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations. Because according to our research  if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high    so North America  Europe  Australia    emissions reductions of the order of    percent per year  and starting immediately  will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two degree target. Let me just put that into context. The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval. So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth  because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place  it means that if our economies grow  then so do our emissions. So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in      where we said that to avoid the two degree framing of dangerous climate change  economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations. This is a really difficult message to take  because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently. This is not about just incremental change. This is about doing things differently  about whole system change  and sometimes it's about doing less things. And this applies to all of us  whatever sphere of influence we have. So it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work  or talking with our friends and family  or  quite simply  changing our lifestyles. Because we really need to make significant change. At the moment  we're choosing a four degree scenario. If we really want to avoid the two degree scenario  there really is no time like the present to act. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Alice  basically what you're saying  the talk is  unless wealthy nations start cutting    percent per year the emissions now  this year  not in      or '    we are going to go straight to the four plus degree scenario. I am wondering what's your take on the cut by    percent for     . Alice Bows Larkin  Yeah  it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees. One of the things that often    when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do  is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions. So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that. The more we do that  because it's the cumulative emissions  the short term stuff that really matters. So it does make a huge difference. If a big country like China  for example  continues to grow even for just a few extra years  that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize. So I don't think we can even say when it will be  because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term. But I think we've just got huge scope  and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand  which is a shame. BG  Alice  thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data. ABL  Thank you. I want to talk to you about the future of medicine. But before I do that  I want to talk a little bit about the past. Now  throughout much of the recent history of medicine  we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model. In fact  the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words  have disease  take pill  kill something. Now  the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution. Many of you might not know this  but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States. But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative. Here you had a chemical  either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory  and it would course through your body  it would find its target  lock into its target    a microbe or some part of a microbe    and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness  exquisite specificity. And you would end up taking a previously fatal  lethal disease    a pneumonia  syphilis  tuberculosis    and transforming that into a curable  or treatable illness. You have a pneumonia  you take penicillin  you kill the microbe and you cure the disease. So seductive was this idea  so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something  that it really swept through biology. It was a transformation like no other. And we've really spent the last     years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases  in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease. And it's worked  but it's only worked partly. Let me show you. You know  if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body  every chemical reaction that your body is capable of  most people think that that number is on the order of a million. Let's call it a million. And now you ask the question  what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted by the entire pharmacopoeia  all of medicinal chemistry  That number is    . The rest is chemical darkness. In other words   .    percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism. You know  if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces  then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge  the outer edge  of that network. It's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in Wichita  Kansas who is tinkering with about    or    telephone lines. So what do we do about this idea  What if we reorganized this approach  In fact  it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one might think about illness in a radically different way  rather than disease  medicine  target. In fact  the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards  not downwards  but upwards  and we begin with a self regulating  semi autonomous unit called a cell. These self regulating  semi autonomous units give rise to self regulating  semi autonomous units called organs  and these organs coalesce to form things called humans  and these organisms ultimately live in environments  which are partly self regulating and partly semi autonomous. What's nice about this scheme  this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards  is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way. Take a disease like cancer. Since the     s  we've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer. We've tried to kill cells using a variety of chemotherapies  or targeted therapies  and as most of us know  that's worked. It's worked for diseases like leukemia. It's worked for some forms of breast cancer  but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach. And it's only in the last    years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system  remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum. It actually grows in a human organism. And could you use the organismal capacity  the fact that human beings have an immune system  to attack cancer  In fact  it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer. And finally there's the level of the environment  isn't there  You know  we don't think of cancer as altering the environment. But let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment. It's called a prison. You take loneliness  you take depression  you take confinement  and you add to that  rolled up in a little white sheet of paper  one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know  called nicotine  and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know  and you have a pro carcinogenic environment. But you can have anti carcinogenic environments too. There are attempts to create milieus  change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer  for instance. We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer. Or take another disease  like depression. Again  working upwards  since the     s and     s  we've tried  again  desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells    serotonin  dopamine    and tried to cure depression that way  and that's worked  but then that reached the limit. And we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ  the brain  rewire it  remodel it  and that  of course  we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that  and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines  pills  really is much more effective than either one alone. Can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression  Can you lock out the signals that elicit depression  Again  moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization. What's really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor. Rather than killing something  in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases    kidney failure  diabetes  hypertension  osteoarthritis    maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something. And that's the key  perhaps  to reframing our thinking about medicine. Now  this idea of changing  of creating a perceptual shift  as it were  came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about    years ago. About    years ago    I've been a runner most of my life    I went for a run  a Saturday morning run  I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move. My right knee was swollen up  and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone. And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs. And I had an MRI the next week  and it looked like that. Essentially  the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered. Now  if you're looking at me and feeling sorry  let me tell you a few facts. If I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience     percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this.    percent of all women by the age of    would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration.    to    percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs. So this is a very common disease. Well  the second perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments. So about    years ago we began  we brought this process into the laboratory  and we began to do simple experiments  mechanically trying to fix this degeneration. We tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse cartilage degeneration  and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process  essentially it came to naught. Nothing happened. And then about seven years ago  we had a research student from Australia. The nice thing about Australians is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down. And so Dan suggested to me   You know  maybe it isn't a mechanical problem. Maybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem.  In other words  he had two hypotheses. Number one  there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell    a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton  bone  cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton  just like there's a stem cell in blood  just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system. And two  that maybe that  the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what's causing osteochondral arthritis  a very common ailment. So really the question was  were we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell. So we switched our models  and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells. And to cut again a long story short  about five years ago  we found these cells. They live inside the skeleton. Here's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them. The white stuff is bone  and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell    columns of cartilage  columns of bone coming out of a single cell. These cells are fascinating. They have four properties. Number one is that they live where they're expected to live. They live just underneath the surface of the bone  underneath cartilage. You know  in biology  it's location  location  location. And they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage. That's one. Here's an interesting property. You can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton  you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory  and they are dying to form cartilage. Remember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money  These cells are dying to form cartilage. They form their own furls of cartilage around themselves. They're also  number three  the most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered. This is a little bone  a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself. These stem cells have come in and repaired  in yellow  the bone  in white  the cartilage  almost completely. So much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture  fixing it locally and then stopping their work. Now  the fourth one is the most ominous  and that is that their numbers decline precipitously  precipitously  tenfold  fiftyfold  as you age. And so what had happened  really  is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift. We had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories. And in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea  cells  organisms  environments  because we were now thinking about bone stem cells  we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease. And then the next question was  are there organs  Can you build this as an organ outside the body  Can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma  And perhaps most interestingly  can you ascend right up and create environments  You know  we know that exercise remodels bone  but come on  none of us is going to exercise. So could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage  And perhaps more interesting  and more importantly  the question is  can you apply this model more globally outside medicine  What's at stake  as I said before  is not killing something  but growing something. And it raises a series of  I think  some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future. Could your medicine be a cell and not a pill  How would we grow these cells  What we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells  We heard about the problems of unleashing growth. Could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing  Could your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body and then implanted into the body  Could that stop some of the degeneration  What if the organ needed to have memory  In cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory. How could we implant those memories back in  Could we store these organs  Would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back  And perhaps most puzzlingly  could your medicine be an environment  Could you patent an environment  You know  in every culture  shamans have been using environments as medicines. Could we imagine that for our future  I've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models. So let me end with some thoughts about model building. That's what we do as scientists. You know  when an architect builds a model  he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature. But when a scientist is building a model  he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor. He or she is trying to create a new way of seeing. The former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift. Now  antibiotics created such a perceptual shift in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored  distorted  very successfully  the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years. But we need new models to think about medicine in the future. That's what's at stake. You know  there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful enough drugs  and that's partly true. But perhaps the real reason is that we don't have powerful enough ways of thinking about medicines. It's certainly true that it would be lovely to have new medicines. But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's  mechanisms  models  metaphors. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I really like this metaphor. How does it link in  There's a lot of talk in technologyland about the personalization of medicine  that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically  your genome  your current context. Does that apply to this model you've got here  Siddhartha Mukherjee  It's a very interesting question. We've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics. That's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor  again  to use that same word  in medicine today  that we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine. But of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being  as it were. That chain of being  really the first organized unit of that  is the cell. So  if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way  we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies  and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies  and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment. So I think at every stage  you know    there's that metaphor  there's turtles all the way. Well  in this  there's personalization all the way. CA  So when you say medicine could be a cell and not a pill  you're talking about potentially your own cells. SM  Absolutely. CA  So converted to stem cells  perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something  and prepared. SM  And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing. This is what's happening  and in fact  we're slowly moving  not away from genomics  but incorporating genomics into what we call multi order  semi autonomous  self regulating systems  like cells  like organs  like environments. CA  Thank you so much. SM  Pleasure. Thanks. Two twin domes  two radically opposed design cultures. One is made of thousands of steel parts  the other of a single silk thread. One is synthetic  the other organic. One is imposed on the environment  the other creates it. One is designed for nature  the other is designed by her. Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble  he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not chiseled. They grow. And in our smallest units of life  our cells  we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate. Tools also have consequences. At least since the Industrial Revolution  the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production. Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts  framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions. But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature. Take human skin  for example. Our facial skins are thin with large pores. Our back skins are thicker  with small pores. One acts mainly as filter  the other mainly as barrier  and yet it's the same skin  no parts  no assemblies. It's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity. So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view  the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene  between machine and organism  between assembly and growth  between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin. These two worldviews  my left brain and right brain  analysis and synthesis  will play out on the two screens behind me. My work  at its simplest level  is about uniting these two worldviews  moving away from assembly and closer into growth. You're probably asking yourselves  Why now  Why was this not possible    or even five years ago  We live in a very special time in history  a rare time  a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we've never had access to before. These fields are computational design  allowing us to design complex forms with simple code  additive manufacturing  letting us produce parts by adding material rather than carving it out  materials engineering  which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution  and synthetic biology  enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA. And at the intersection of these four fields  my team and I create. Please meet the minds and hands of my students. We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales  from the large scale  like this robotic arm with an    foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings  to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark. Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya  an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture  and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it. In our next project  we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt    this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen    like a second skin that are made of a single part  stiff at the contours  flexible around the waist. Together with my long term  D printing collaborator Stratasys  we  D printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells  and I'll show more objects like it. This helmet combines stiff and soft materials in    micron resolution. This is the resolution of a human hair. It's also the resolution of a CT scanner. That designers have access to such high resolution analytic and synthetic tools  enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies  but also the physiological makeup of our tissues. Next  we designed an acoustic chair  a chair that would be at once structural  comfortable and would also absorb sound. Professor Carter  my collaborator  and I turned to nature for inspiration  and by designing this irregular surface pattern  it becomes sound absorbent. We printed its surface out of    different properties  varying in rigidity  opacity and color  corresponding to pressure points on the human body. Its surface  as in nature  varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly  but by continuously and delicately varying material property. But is nature ideal  Are there no parts in nature  I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home  but when I was young  my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible  and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about. As she recounts   On the third day of Creation  God commands the Earth to grow a fruit bearing fruit tree.  For this first fruit tree  there was to be no differentiation between trunk  branches  leaves and fruit. The whole tree was a fruit. Instead  the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers. The land created a world made of parts. I often ask myself   What would design be like if objects were made of a single part  Would we return to a better state of creation   So we looked for that biblical material  that fruit bearing fruit tree kind of material  and we found it. The second most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin  and some     million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps  crabs  scorpions and butterflies. We thought if we could tune its properties  we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part. So that's what we did. We called Legal Seafood    we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells  we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste. By varying chemical concentrations  we were able to achieve a wide array of properties    from dark  stiff and opaque  to light  soft and transparent. In order to print the structures in large scale  we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles. The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these    foot long structures made of a single material      percent recyclable. When the parts are ready  they're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air. So why are we still designing with plastics  The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet  .  billion year ago  as we learned yesterday. Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT  we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar. For the first time  we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh  and if scaled even larger  to windows. A fruit bearing fruit tree. Working with an ancient material  one of the first lifeforms on the planet  plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology  we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree. And here's the best part  for objects designed to biodegrade  put them in the sea  and they will nourish marine life  place them in soil  and they will help grow a tree. The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system. We looked for the possibility of creating life sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages. To do that  we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow. So like the periodic table  we came up with our own table of the elements  new lifeforms that were computationally grown  additively manufactured and biologically augmented. I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy  only instead of transmuting precious metals  you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels. It's called microfluidics. We  D printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures. In our first piece of clothing  we combined two microorganisms. The first is cyanobacteria. It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds. And the second  E. coli  the bacterium that inhabits the human gut. One converts light into sugar  the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment. Now  these two microorganisms never interact in nature. In fact  they never met each other. They've been here  engineered for the first time  to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing. Think of it as evolution not by natural selection  but evolution by design. In order to contain these relationships  we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract  that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way. We then started growing these channels on the human body  varying material properties according to the desired functionality. Where we wanted more photosynthesis  we would design more transparent channels. This wearable digestive system  when it's stretched end to end  spans    meters. This is half the length of a football field  and    times as long as our small intestines. And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED    our first photosynthetic wearable  liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing. Thank you. Mary Shelley said   We are unfashioned creatures  but only half made up.  What if design could provide that other half  What if we could create structures that would augment living matter  What if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins  repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies  Think of this as a form of edited biology. This entire collection  Wanderers  that was named after planets  was not to me really about fashion per se  but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond  to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies  the microorganisms that we inhabit  our products and even our buildings. I call this material ecology. To do this  we always need to return back to nature. By now  you know that a  D printer prints material in layers. You also know that nature doesn't. It grows. It adds with sophistication. This silkworm cocoon  for example  creates a highly sophisticated architecture  a home inside which to metamorphisize. No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication. It does so by combining not two materials  but two proteins in different concentrations. One acts as the structure  the other is the glue  or the matrix  holding those fibers together. And this happens across scales. The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment    it creates a tensile structure    and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon. Tension and compression  the two forces of life  manifested in a single material. In order to better understand how this complex process works  we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm  to the spinneret. We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors  and that allowed us to create this   dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon. However  when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch  not inside a box  we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily metamorphisize. So we started designing different environments  different scaffolds  and we discovered that the shape  the composition  the structure of the cocoon  was directly informed by the environment. Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons  their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry. We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon. They would healthily metamorphisize  and we would be able to create these things. So we scaled this process up to architectural scale. We had a robot spin the template out of silk  and we placed it on our site. We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas  so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure. We then created holes  or apertures  that would lock in the rays of light and heat  distributing those silkworms on the structure. We were ready to receive the caterpillars. We ordered       silkworms from an online silk farm. And after four weeks of feeding  they were ready to spin with us. We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold  and as they spin they pupate  they mate  they lay eggs  and life begins all over again    just like us but much  much shorter. Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity  and he was right. As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk  they give this entire pavilion its integrity. And over two to three weeks        silkworms spin       kilometers. In a curious symmetry  this is also the length of the Silk Road. The moths  after they hatch  produce  .  million eggs. This could be used for     additional pavilions for the future. So here they are  the two worldviews. One spins silk out of a robotic arm  the other fills in the gaps. If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us  to form a two material ecology  then designers must unite these two worldviews. Which brings us back  of course  to the beginning. Here's to a new age of design  a new age of creation  that takes us from a nature inspired design to a design inspired nature  and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too long There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead But I was just thinking  merely thinking I've got loads of pictures  I've got the one of you in that dancing dress But man I feel silly in that dim light Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights  I am sinking  merely sinking I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe I'm a singer without a song If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger and I ...

Singing is sharing. When you sing  you have to know what you're talking about intimately  and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself. I look for this intention to share in everything  and I ask  what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product or this restaurant or this meal  And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end  then you are taking  not giving. And this is a song that's about    it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of. This song is called  Home   and it's sort of a  This is where I'm from  nice to meet you all   kind of song. Home is the sound of birds early in the morning Home is a song I've always remembered Home is the memory of my first day in school Home is the books that I carry around Home is an alley in a faraway town Home is the places I ve been and where I d like to go Home I'm always gonna feel at home No matter where I may roam I'm always gonna find my way back home No matter how far I m gone I m always gonna feel this longing No matter where I might stay Home is a feather twirling in the air Home is flowers in a windowsill Home is all the things she said to me Home is a photo I never threw away Home is the smile on my face when I die Home is the taste of an apple pie I met a woman  she always lived in the same place And she said home is where you re born and raised And I met a man  he sat looking out to the sea And he said home is where you want to be I met a girl in some downtown bar And she said I'll have whatever he's having And I asked her how come we never met before  And she said all my life I ve been trying to get a place of my own I m always gonna feel at home No matter where I may roam Always gonna find my way back home No matter how far I m gone I'm always gonna feel this longing No matter where I might stay In my lab  we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here. Unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today  this robot doesn't have any GPS on board. So without GPS  it's hard for robots like this to determine their position. This robot uses onboard sensors  cameras and laser scanners  to scan the environment. It detects features from the environment  and it determines where it is relative to those features  using a method of triangulation. And then it can assemble all these features into a map  like you see behind me. And this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision free manner. What I want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory  where this robot was able to go for longer distances. So here you'll see  on the top right  what the robot sees with the camera. And on the main screen    and of course this is sped up by a factor of four    on the main screen you'll see the map that it's building. So this is a high resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory. And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab  which is recognizable by the clutter that you see. But the main point I want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building high resolution maps at five centimeters resolution  allowing somebody who is outside the lab  or outside the building to deploy these without actually going inside  and trying to infer what happens inside the building. Now there's one problem with robots like this. The first problem is it's pretty big. Because it's big  it's heavy. And these robots consume about     watts per pound. And this makes for a very short mission life. The second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive    a laser scanner  a camera and the processors. That drives up the cost of this robot. So we asked ourselves a question  what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive  that's lightweight  that has sensing onboard and computation  And we invented the flying phone. So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf  and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store. And you can see this robot reading the letters   TED  in this case  looking at the corners of the  T  and the  E  and then triangulating off of that  flying autonomously. That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy  Giuseppe can kill it. In addition to building these small robots  we also experiment with aggressive behaviors  like you see here. So this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second  pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction. The main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments. And in this next video  just like you see this bird  an eagle  gracefully coordinating its wings  its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water  our robot can go fishing  too. In this case  this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air. So you can see this robot going at about three meters per second  which is faster than walking speed  coordinating its arms  its claws and its flight with split second timing to achieve this maneuver. In another experiment  I want to show you how the robot adapts its flight to control its suspended payload  whose length is actually larger than the width of the window. So in order to accomplish this  it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through. But of course we want to make these even smaller  and we're inspired in particular by honeybees. So if you look at honeybees  and this is a slowed down video  they're so small  the inertia is so lightweight    that they don't care    they bounce off my hand  for example. This is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior. And smaller is better  because along with the small size you get lower inertia. Along with lower inertia    along with lower inertia  you're resistant to collisions. And that makes you more robust. So just like these honeybees  we build small robots. And this particular one is only    grams in weight. It consumes only six watts of power. And it can travel up to six meters per second. So if I normalize that to its size  it's like a Boeing     traveling ten times the speed of sound. And I want to show you an example. This is probably the first planned mid air collision  at one twentieth normal speed. These are going at a relative speed of two meters per second  and this illustrates the basic principle. The two gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling  but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions. And so small also means safe. In my lab  as we developed these robots  we start off with these big robots and then now we're down to these small robots. And if you plot a histogram of the number of Band Aids we've ordered in the past  that sort of tailed off now. Because these robots are really safe. The small size has some disadvantages  and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages. The basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups  or swarms. So  similarly  in our lab  we try to create artificial robot swarms. And this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots. And within each robot  you have to think about the interplay of sensing  communication  computation    and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage. So from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms. The first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors. They need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors. So this video illustrates the basic idea. You have four robots    one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator  literally. But because the robots interact with each other  they sense their neighbors  they essentially follow. And here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers. So again  it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go. It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors. So the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle. And this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity. Here the key idea is that the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors. They're asked to form a circular shape  and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation  or how many robots you pull out  each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor. It's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape  but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination. Now if you put these ideas together  the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute. And these shapes can be varying as a function of time  and you'll see these robots start from a circular formation  change into a rectangular formation  stretch into a straight line  back into an ellipse. And they do this with the same kind of split second coordination that you see in natural swarms  in nature. So why work with swarms  Let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in. The first one has to do with agriculture  which is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide. As you well know  one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished. Most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated. And the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving  but our production system efficiency is actually declining. And that's mostly because of water shortage  crop diseases  climate change and a couple of other things. So what can robots do  Well  we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community. And the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards  and then we build precision models of individual plants. So just like personalized medicine  while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually  what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs    the inputs in this case being water  fertilizer and pesticide. Here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard  and in a minute you'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side. And what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard. Within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard. Let's see what those maps look like. In the next video  you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot. On the top left is essentially a standard color camera. On the left center is an infrared camera. And on the bottom left is a thermal camera. And on the main panel  you're seeing a three dimensional reconstruction of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees. Armed with information like this  we can do several things. The first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple  count the number of fruits on every tree. By doing this  you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard  optimizing the production chain downstream. The second thing we can do is take models of plants  construct three dimensional reconstructions  and from that estimate the canopy size  and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant. And this is called the leaf area index. So if you know this leaf area index  you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant  which again tells you how healthy each plant is. By combining visual and infrared information  we can also compute indices such as NDVI. And in this particular case  you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops. This is easily discernible from imagery  not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery. And then lastly  one thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis    and this is an orange tree    which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves. But robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard. Systems like this can really help  and we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent and  more importantly  decrease the amount of inputs such as water by    percent by using aerial robot swarms. Lastly  I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future  Yash Mulgaonkar  Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno  who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw. Thank you. We all go to doctors. And we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence    evidence that's designed to help us. However  the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone. What if I told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population  I'm an emergency medicine doctor. I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency. It's about saving lives. How cool is that  OK  there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes  but no matter who walks through the door to the ER  we order the same tests  we prescribe the same medication  without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients. Why would we  We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women. A recent Government Accountability study revealed that    percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women. So let's think about that for a minute. Why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market  Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory  to animal studies  to then clinical trials on humans  finally to go through a regulatory approval process  to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you  Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process. So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through  What's happening  Well  it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory  they're male cells  and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals  and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men. How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research  Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media  and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien. Ambien was released on the market over    years ago  and since then  hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written  primarily to women  because women suffer more sleep disorders than men. But just this past year  the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only  because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men  causing them to wake up in the morning with more of the active drug in their system. And then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car  and they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents. And I can't help but think  as an emergency physician  how many of my patients that I've cared for over the years were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon    years ago when this drug was first released. How many other things need to be analyzed by gender  What else are we missing  World War II changed a lot of things  and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent. So some much needed guidelines or rules were set into place  and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies. There was fear  what if something happened to the fetus during the study  Who would be responsible  And so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise  because let's face it    men's bodies are pretty homogeneous. They don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men. It was easier. It was cheaper. Not to mention  at this time  there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way  apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones. So it was decided  medical research was performed on men  and the results were later applied to women. What did this do to the notion of women's health  Women's health became synonymous with reproduction  breasts  ovaries  uterus  pregnancy. It's this term we now refer to as  bikini medicine.  And this stayed this way until about the     s  when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice  in that apart from reproductive issues  virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient. Since that time  an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way. You know  we have this saying in medicine  children are not just little adults. And we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults. And it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light. And we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives. And I know the same thing can be said about women. Women are not just men with boobs and tubes. But they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity. Let's take the cardiovascular system  for example. This area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks. Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women  but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men. Men will complain of crushing chest pain    an elephant is sitting on their chest. And we call this typical. Women have chest pain  too. But more women than men will complain of  just not feeling right    can't seem to get enough air in    just so tired lately.  And for some reason we call this atypical  even though  as I mentioned  women do make up half the population. And so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences  If we look at the anatomy  the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men  and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men. And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack  well  they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men  and so aren't as good at determining that in women. And then if we think about the medications    common medications that we use  like aspirin. We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack  but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman  it's actually harmful  What this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface. Emergency medicine is a fast paced business. In how many life saving areas of medicine  like cancer and stroke  are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing  Or even  why is it that some people get those runny noses more than others  or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others  The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex. What does this mean  Sex is DNA. Gender is how someone presents themselves in society. And these two may not always match up  as we can see with our transgendered population. But it's important to realize that from the moment of conception  every cell in our bodies    skin  hair  heart and lungs    contains our own unique DNA  and that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become male or female  man or woman. It used to be thought that those sex determining chromosomes pictured here    XY if you're male  XX if you're female    merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes  and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex. But we now know that that theory was wrong    or it's at least a little incomplete. And thankfully  scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute  who works on the Y chromosome  and Doctor Yang from UCLA  they have found evidence that tells us that those sex determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs  or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases. This new knowledge is the game changer  and it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence  but it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data at the bedside  today. Right now. And to help do this  I'm a co founder of a national organization called Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative  and we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching and for patient care. And we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table. That's a big job. It's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception. But I believe in them. I know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum. It's about training the future health care providers correctly. And regionally  I'm a co creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine here at Brown University  called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine  and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions  like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse  but we also believe that education is paramount. We've created a     degree model of education. We have programs for the doctors  for the nurses  for the students and for the patients. Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders. We all have a role in making a difference. But I must warn you  this is not easy. In fact  it's hard. It's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health and research. It's changing our relationship to the health care system. But there's no going back. We now know just enough to know that we weren't doing it right. Martin Luther King  Jr. has said   Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability  but comes through continuous struggle.  And the first step towards change is awareness. This is not just about improving medical care for women. This is about personalized  individualized health care for everyone. This awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women. And from now on  I want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender. They may not know the answer    yet. But the conversation has begun  and together we can all learn. Remember  for me and my colleagues in this field  your sex and gender matter. Thank you. So this right here is the tiny village of Elle  close to Lista. It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway. And on January   this year  an elderly guy who lives in the village  he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm. And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge  he found a wetsuit. It was grey and black  and he thought it looked cheap. Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones. It was clearly the remains of a human being. And usually  in Norway  dead people are identified quickly. So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area  national missing reports  and looked for accidents with a possible connection. They found nothing. So they ran a DNA profile  and they started searching internationally through Interpol. Nothing. This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing. It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave. But then  after a month  the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands. A couple of months earlier  they had found a body  in an identical wetsuit  and they had no idea who this person was. But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit. So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time  October          in the French city of Calais by the English Channel. But this was all they were able to figure out. The customer paid cash. There was no surveillance footage from the shop. So it became a cold case. We heard this story  and it triggered me and my colleague  photographer Tomm Christiansen  and we of course had the obvious question  who were these people  At the time  I'd barely heard about Calais  but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things. It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain  and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain. And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people  and the police made this theory as well. Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France  people would just know. Your friends or family would report you missing  the police would come search for you  the media would know  and there would be pictures of you on lampposts. It's difficult to disappear without a trace. But if you just fled the war in Syria  and your family  if you have any family left  don't necessarily know where you are  and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day. Well  if you disappear one day  nobody will notice. The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone. And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year  and after three months of investigation  we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria  ended up stuck in Calais  bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England. It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name  everybody has a story  everybody is someone. But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today. So this is where we started our search. This is in Calais. Right now  between       and       people are living here under horrible conditions. It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe. Limited access to food  limited access to water  limited access to health care. Disease and infections are widespread. And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum. And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry  or the Eurotunnel  or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains. Most want to go to Britain because they know the language  and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there. They want to work  they want to study  they want to be able to continue their lives. A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers. If you go to Calais and talk to refugees  you'll meet lawyers  politicians  engineers  graphic designers  farmers  soldiers. You've got the whole spectrum. But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants  because we usually do that in statistics. So you have    million refugees globally. About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year  and roughly       are staying in Calais. But these are numbers  and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are  where they came from  or why they're here. And first  I want to tell you about one of them. This is    year old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies. And after a while  we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England  and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months. And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October        . That was the same date the wetsuits were bought. So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him  and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative who now lives in Jordan. The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi. And while we were doing all this investigation  we got to know Mouaz's story. He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in     . He was raised in a middle class family  and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent    years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria. While his father was in prison  Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters. They said he was that kind of guy. Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus. So a couple of years into the Syrian war  the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country  Jordan. Their father had problems finding work in Jordan  and Mouaz could not continue his studies  so he figured   OK  the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work.  So he goes to Turkey. In Turkey  he's not accepted at a university  and once he had left Jordan as a refugee  he was not allowed to reenter. So then he decides to head for the UK  where his uncle lives. He makes it into Algeria  walks into Libya  pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat  and from there on he heads to Dunkirk  the city right next to Calais by the English Channel. We know he made at least    failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck. But at some point  he must have given up all hope. The last night we know he was alive  he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk. We found his name in the records  and he seems to have stayed there alone. The day after  he went into Calais  entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before   o'clock in the evening  along with Shadi Kataf. They both bought wetsuits  and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive. We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz  but we weren't able to do that. But they do have a similar story. We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his  living in Germany  had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook. So we got in touch with him. Shadi  a couple of years older than Mouaz  was also raised in Damascus. He was a working kind of guy. He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company. He lived with his extended family  but their house got bombed early in the war. So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk. Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth. They've been bombed by the military  they've been besieged  they've been stormed by ISIS and they've been cut off from supplies for years. There was a UN official who visited last year  and he said   They ate all the grass so there was no grass left.  Out of a population of          only        are believed to still be left in Yarmouk. Shadi and his sisters got out. The parents are still stuck inside. So Shadi and one of his sisters  they fled to Libya. This was after the fall of Gaddafi  but before Libya turned into full blown civil war. And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya  Shadi took up scuba diving  and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater. He fell completely in love with the ocean  so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya  late August       he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy. Reality was not that easy. We don't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family  but we do know that he struggled. And by the end of September  he was living on the streets somewhere in France. On October    he calls his cousin in Belgium  and explains his situation. He said   I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop. I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain  but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim.  His cousin  of course  tried to warn him not to  but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat  and his phone was never switched on again. What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later      kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway. He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway  and none of his family will be able to attend. Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death  but I don't agree. To me  this is a story about two questions that I think we all share  what is a better life  and what am I willing to do to achieve it  And to me  and probably a lot of you  a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful  whether that be spending more time with your family and friends  travel to an exotic place  or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers. And this is all within our reach pretty easily. But if you are fleeing a war zone  the answers to those two questions are dramatically different. A better life is a life in safety. It's a life in dignity. A better life means not having your house bombed  not fearing being kidnapped. It means being able to send your children to school  go to university  or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none  and that's a strong motivation. And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second grade citizen  living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid  racist name like  The Jungle   most of us would be willing to do just about anything. If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel  they would probably say   This is worth the risk   because they could no longer see any other option. And that's desperation  but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in     . Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Anders. This is Tomm Christiansen  who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together. Tomm  you two have been back to Calais recently. This was the third trip. It was after the publication of the article. What has changed  What have you seen there  Tomm Christiansen  The first time we were in Calais  it was about       refugees there. They had a difficult time  but they were positive  they had hope. The last time  the camp has grown  maybe four or five thousand people. It seemed more permanent  NGOs have arrived  a small school has opened. But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time  and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better  so now The Jungle is growing  along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees. BG  Are you planning to go back  And continue the reporting  TC  Yes. BG  Anders  I'm a former journalist  and to me  it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis  Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story  which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility  but how did you sell it to your editors  Anders Fjellberg  It wasn't easy at first  because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out. As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was  we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted  just travel wherever you need to go  do whatever you need to do  just get this done. BG  That's an editor taking responsibility. The story  by the way  has been translated and published across several European countries  and certainly will continue to do. And we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm. As a singer songwriter  people often ask me about my influences or  as I like to call them  my sonic lineages. And I could easily tell you that I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with  by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors  or by the     s pop on my childhood radio stations. But beyond genre  there is another question  how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make  I believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting  and to look at this idea a little bit more closely  I'm going to talk today about three things  nature  language and silence    or rather  the impossibility of true silence. And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world already alive with musical expression  with each of us serving as active participants  whether we know it or not. I'm going to start today with nature  but before we do that  let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up. Here it is. It's beautiful  isn't it  Gotcha  That is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up. That is the sound of a bird slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own. It was released as part of Peter Sz ke's      Hungarian recording  The Unknown Music of Birds   where he records many birds and slows down their pitches to reveal what's underneath. Let's listen to the full speed recording. Now  let's hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them. It's incredible. Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong. As humans  we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers. In Ethiopia  birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself. The story goes like this        years ago  a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum  a major trading center of the ancient world. His name was Yared. When Yared was seven years old his father died  and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle  who was a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition  one of the oldest churches in the world. Now  this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning  and Yared had to study and study and study and study  and one day he was studying under a tree  when three birds came to him. One by one  these birds became his teachers. They taught him music    scales  in fact. And Yared  eventually recognized as Saint Yared  used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns for worship and celebration. And he used these scales to compose and to create an indigenous musical notation system. And these scales evolved into what is known as ki it  the unique  pentatonic  five note  modal system that is very much alive and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today. Now  I love this story because it's true at multiple levels. Saint Yared was a real  historical figure  and the natural world can be our musical teacher. And we have so many examples of this  the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them. Musician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low  medium and high frequency bands  in exactly the same way as a symphony does. And countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song. Yes  the natural world can be our cultural teacher. So let's go now to the uniquely human world of language. Every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees  whether it's Mandarin Chinese  where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning  to a language like English  where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ... As an Ethiopian American woman  I grew up around the language of Amharic  Amhari a. It was my first language  the language of my parents  one of the main languages of Ethiopia. And there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language  its depth of poetics  its double entendres  its wax and gold  its humor  its proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life. But there's also this melodicism  a musicality built right in. And I find this distilled most clearly in what I like to call emphatic language    language that's meant to highlight or underline or that springs from surprise. Take  for example  the word   indey.  Now  if there are Ethiopians in the audience  they're probably chuckling to themselves  because the word means something like  No   or  How could he   or  No  he didn't.  It kind of depends on the situation. But when I was a kid  this was my very favorite word  and I think it's because it has a pitch. It has a melody. You can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth.  Indey     it dips  and then raises again. And as a musician and composer  when I hear that word  something like this is floating through my mind. Or take  for example  the phrase for  It is right  or  It is correct      Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu.  It's an affirmation  an agreement.  Lickih nehu.  When I hear that phrase  something like this starts rolling through my mind. And in both of those cases  what I did was I took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions. And I like to write bass lines  so they both ended up kind of as bass lines. Now  this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others who work intimately with music and language  but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid  how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us. It was from them and from Amhari a that I learned that we are awash in musical expression with every word  every sentence that we speak  every word  every sentence that we receive. Perhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now. Finally  we go to the     s United States and the most seminal work of   th century avant garde composition  John Cage's         written for any instrument or combination of instruments. The musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score  which was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art    the score  that is. And this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and    seconds. And  at once enraging and enrapturing  Cage shows us that even when there are no strings being plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys  still there is music  still there is music  still there is music. And what is this music  It was that sneeze in the back. It is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves  their coughs  their sighs  their rustles  their whispers  their sneezes  the room  the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting  creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold  the pipes clanking and contributing. And controversial though it was  and even controversial though it remains  Cage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence. Even in the most silent environments  we still hear and feel the sound of our own heartbeats. The world is alive with musical expression. We are already immersed. Now  I had my own moment of  let's say  remixing John Cage a couple of months ago when I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils. And it was late one night and it was time to stir  so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot  and I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me  and it started to roll back and forth making this sound. And it stopped me cold. I thought   What a weird  cool swing that cooking pan lid has.  So when the lentils were ready and eaten  I hightailed it to my backyard studio  and I made this. Now  John Cage wasn't instructing musicians to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music. He was saying that on its own  the environment is musically generative  that it is generous  that it is fertile  that we are already immersed. Musician  music researcher  surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and he studies music and the brain. And he has a theory that it is possible    it is possible    that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music  because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone. And if that's true  it means that we're hard wired for music  that we can find it anywhere  that there is no such thing as a musical desert  that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis  and that is marvelous. We can add to the soundtrack  but it's already playing. And it doesn't mean don't study music. Study music  trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration. But there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong. So the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration  look no further than your tires  as they roll over the unusual grooves of the freeway  or the top right burner of your stove and that strange way that it clicks as it is preparing to light. When seeking melodic inspiration  look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language. We are the audience and we are the composers and we take from these pieces we are given. We make  we make  we make  we make  knowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape  there is no end to the inspiration    if we are listening. Thank you. Father Daniel Berrigan once said that  writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead.  I think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts. They're unseen and unheard. It's easy to simply ignore them and it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden. As a journalist  I think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching  are precisely the stories that we need to tell. That's why I began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States  for so called  second tier  terrorists. The government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs. Prisoners and guards call them  Little Guantanamo.  They are islands unto themselves. But unlike Gitmo they exist right here  at home  floating within larger federal prisons. There are   CMUs. One was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute  Indiana  and the other is inside this prison  in Marion  Illinois. Neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened. CMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes. Some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence. I'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner. I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said   When the prisons and gates slam shut  prisoners do not lose their human quality.  Every prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison  phone calls  letters and visits from family. CMUs aren't solitary confinement  but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States. Their phone calls can be limited to    minutes a month  compared to the     minutes other prisoners receive. Their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper. Their visits can be limited to four hours per month  compared to the    hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph receive in the supermax. On top of that  CMU visits are non contact which means prisoners are not allowed to even hug their family. As one CMU prisoner said   We're not being tortured here  except psychologically.  The government won't say who is imprisoned here. But through court documents  open records requests and interviews with current and former prisoners  some small windows into the CMUs have opened. There's an estimated    to    prisoners here  and they're overwhelmingly Muslim. They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir  who violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there. They've included people like Yassin Aref. Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees. He was arrested in      as part of an FBI sting. Aref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan  which is a tradition in Islamic culture. It turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack. Aref didn't know. For that  he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group. The CMUs also include some non Muslim prisoners. The guards call them  balancers   meaning they help balance out the racial numbers  in hopes of deflecting law suits. These balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like Daniel McGowan. McGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the Earth Liberation Front. During his sentencing  he was afraid that he would be sent to a rumored secret prison for terrorists. The judge dismissed all those fears  saying that they weren't supported by any facts. But that might be because the government hasn't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a CMU  and who is responsible for these decisions. When McGowan was transferred  he was told it's because he is a  domestic terrorist   a term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists. Now  keep in mind there are about     prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists  and only a handful of them are in the CMUs. In McGowan's case  he was previously at a low security prison and he had no communications violations. So  why was he moved  Like other CMU prisoners  McGowan repeatedly asked for an answer  a hearing  or some opportunity for an appeal. This example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed.  Wants a transfer.   Told him no.  At one point  the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer out of the CMU citing his good behavior  but the warden was overruled by the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit  working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI. Later I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU not because of what he did  but what he has said. A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's  anti government beliefs.  While imprisoned  he continued writing about environmental issues  saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other. Now  in fairness  if you've spent any time at all in Washington  DC  you know this is really a radical concept for the government. I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU. And I was approved. That came as quite a shock. First  because as I've discussed on this stage before  I learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work. Second  because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU. I had even learned through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit  that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs  like this one. So how could I possibly be approved to visit  A few days before I went out to the prison  I got an answer. I was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend  not a journalist. Journalists are not allowed here. McGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions or published any story  that he would be punished for my reporting. When I arrived for our visit  the guards reminded me that they knew who I was and knew about my work. And they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan  the visit would be terminated. The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as  self contained housing units.  But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes. When you visit a CMU  you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect. But then the walk to the visitation room is silent. When a CMU prisoner has a visit  the rest of the prison is on lockdown. I was ushered into a small room  so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall. There was a grapefruit sized orb in the ceiling for the visit to be live monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit in West Virginia. The unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners  which is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families. There is a thick sheet of foggy  bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan. We spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies. We did our best to find reasons to laugh. To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU  McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington  DC For the record  I'm not. But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names. During our visit  McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily  his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them  to never be able to hold their hands. Three months after our visit  McGowan was transferred out of the CMU and then  without warning  he was sent back again. I had published leaked CMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them. He wanted to see what the government was saying about him  and for that he was sent back to the CMU. When he was finally released at the end of his sentence  his story got even more Kafkaesque. He wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined   Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech.  The next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech. His attorneys quickly secured his release  but the message was very clear  Don't talk about this place. Today  nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration  the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created. According to the Bureau of Prisons  they are for prisoners with  inspirational significance.  I think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons for political prisoners. Prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race  their religion or their political beliefs. Now  if you think that characterization is too strong  just look at some of the government's own documents. When some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU  the sender was told it's because the letters were intended  for political prisoners.  When another prisoner  animal rights activist Andy Stepanian  was sent to a CMU  it was because of his anti government and anti corporate views. Now  I know all of this may be hard to believe  that it's happening right now  and in the United States. But the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs. In the     s  before Marion was home to the CMU  it was home to the notorious Control Unit. Prisoners were locked down in solitary for    hours a day. The warden said the unit was to  control revolutionary attitudes.  In the     s  another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit held women connected to the Weather Underground  Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles. The prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation  and constant light for so called  ideological conversion.  Those prisons were eventually shut down  but only through the campaigning of religious groups and human rights advocates  like Amnesty International. Today  civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights are challenging CMUs in court for depriving prisoners of their due process rights and for retaliating against them for their protected political and religious speech. Many of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit. The message of these groups and my message for you today is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners. Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls. This story is not just about prisoners. It is about us. It is about our own commitment to human rights. It is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past. If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead  they will soon become the stories of ourselves. Thank you. Tom Rielly  I have a couple questions. When I was in high school  I learned about the Bill of Rights  the Constitution  freedom of speech  due process and  about    other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this. How could this possibly be happening  Will Potter  I think that's the number one question I get throughout all of my work  and the short answer is that people don't know. I think the solution to any of these types of situations  any rights abuses  are really dependent on two things. They're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening and then a means and efficacy to actually make a change. And unfortunately with these prisoners  one  people don't know what's happening at all and then they're already disenfranchised populations who don't have access to attorneys  not native English speakers. In some of these cases  they have great representation that I mentioned  but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening. TR  Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council  WP  There's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime  no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate  that whatever happens to them after that is warranted. And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have  that allows these types of things to happen  as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it. TR  All those documents on screen were all real documents  word for word  unchanged at all  right  WP  Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website. It's willpotter.com CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk  so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets. You can see the full version. I relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners  with people that are dealing with this situation every day. And like I said  I've been there myself  as well. TR  You're doing courageous work. WP  Thank you very much. Thank you all. A few years ago  with my colleague  Emmanuelle Charpentier  I invented a new technology for editing genomes. It's called CRISPR Cas . The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease. You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections. Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment  and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb    a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed. So  many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR  that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it. Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas   that's able to seek out  cut and eventually degrade viral DNA in a specific way. And it was through our research to understand the activity of this protein  Cas   that we realized that we could harness its function as a genetic engineering technology    a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells with incredible precision    that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven't been possible in the past. The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys  other organisms as well. Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos. And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells. The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider  because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells  but also in the embryos of organisms  including our own species. And so  together with my colleagues  I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co invented  so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this. What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is  what it can do  where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology. When viruses infect a cell  they inject their DNA. And in a bacterium  the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus  and inserted in little bits into the chromosome    the DNA of the bacterium. And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. A big mouthful    you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR. It's a mechanism that allows cells to record  over time  the viruses they have been exposed to. And importantly  those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny  so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation  but over many generations of cells. This allows the cells to keep a record of infection  and as my colleague  Blake Wiedenheft  likes to say  the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells. Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome  the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA  which is orange in this picture  that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA. RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA  and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence. So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate    they bind    to protein called Cas   which is white in the picture  and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell. It searches through all of the DNA in the cell  to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs. And when those sites are found    as you can see here  the blue molecule is DNA    this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas  cleaver to cut up the viral DNA. It makes a very precise break. So we can think of the Cas  RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA    it makes a double stranded break in the DNA helix. And importantly  this complex is programmable  so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences  and make a break in the DNA at that site. As I'm going to tell you now  we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering  to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced. That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word processing program to fix a typo in a document. The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it. So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double stranded break in its DNA  it can fix that break  either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little  tiny change in the sequence of that position  or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut. So if we have a way to introduce double stranded breaks into DNA at precise places  we can trigger cells to repair those breaks  by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information. So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis  for example  we could trigger cells to repair that mutation. Genome engineering is actually not new  it's been in development since the     s. We've had technologies for sequencing DNA  for copying DNA  and even for manipulating DNA. And these technologies were very promising  but the problem was that they were either inefficient  or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories  or certainly for many clinical applications. So  the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal  because of its relative simplicity. We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software  whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome  we can program it easily  using these little bits of RNA. So once a double stranded break is made in DNA  we can induce repair  and thereby potentially achieve astounding things  like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease. I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood  where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells  compared to solid tissues. Right now  a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease  such as mice. The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or  in this case  an entire organism. Now in this example  the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice. Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome  and they're otherwise completely normal. And when we sequence the DNA from these animals  we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it  using the CRISPR technology. Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease  such as monkeys. And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues  for example  figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells. We also want to understand better how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut  and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off target  or unintended effects of using the technology. I think that we will see clinical application of this technology  certainly in adults  within the next    years. I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time  which is a very exciting thing to think about. And because of the excitement around this technology  there's a lot of interest in start up companies that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology  and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies. But we have to also consider that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement. Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties  such as stronger bones  or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable  like a different eye color or to be taller  things like that.  Designer humans   if you will. Right now  the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known. But it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes  once that knowledge becomes available. This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider  and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos  to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so. And actually  there is an important precedent for such a pause from the     s  when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning  until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated. So  genome engineered humans are not with us yet  but this is no longer science fiction. Genome engineered animals and plants are happening right now. And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility  to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Jennifer  this is a technology with huge consequences  as you pointed out. Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible. There are  of course  the therapeutic results of this  but then there are the un therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction  particularly in the media. This is one of the latest issues of The Economist     Editing humanity.  It's all about genetic enhancement  it's not about therapeutics. What kind of reactions did you get back in March from your colleagues in the science world  when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it  Jennifer Doudna  My colleagues were actually  I think  delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly. It's interesting that as I talk to people  my scientific colleagues as well as others  there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion. BG  There's a big meeting happening in December that you and your colleagues are calling  together with the National Academy of Sciences and others  what do you hope will come out of the meeting  practically  JD  Well  I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly. It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view  but I think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward. BG  Now  colleagues of yours  like George Church  for example  at Harvard  they say   Yeah  ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. We test and test and test again  in animals and in labs  and then once we feel it's safe enough  we move on to humans.  So that's kind of the other school of thought  that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it. Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this  I mean  are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns  and some others just going forward because some countries under regulate or don't regulate at all  JD  Well  I think with any new technology  especially something like this  there are going to be a variety of viewpoints  and I think that's perfectly understandable. I think that in the end  this technology will be used for human genome engineering  but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible. BG  There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially  pretty much like yours. I'm thinking about artificial intelligence  autonomous robots and so on. No one seems    aside from autonomous warfare robots    nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields  in calling for a moratorium. Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields  JD  Well  I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory. Speaking for myself  it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that. But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility. And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way  just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology. BG  Jennifer  thanks for coming to TED. JD  Thank you. I'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place  please. Yes  your happy place  I know you've got one even if it's fake. OK  so  comfortable  Good. Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions. Is there any strip lighting in your happy place  Any plastic tables  Polyester flooring  Mobile phones  No  I think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural  outdoors    on a beach  fireside. We'll be reading or eating or knitting. And we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements. Natural things make us happy. And happiness is a great motivator  we strive for happiness. Perhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything  in the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural. So let's start there    with the idea that good design should feel natural. Your phone is not very natural. And you probably think you're addicted to your phone  but you're really not. We're not addicted to devices  we're addicted to the information that flows through them. I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world. I'm interested in how we access that information  how we experience it. We're moving from a time of static information  held in books and libraries and bus stops  through a period of digital information  towards a period of fluid information  where your children will expect to be able to access anything  anywhere at any time  from quantum physics to medieval viticulture  from gender theory to tomorrow's weather  just like switching on a lightbulb    Imagine that. Humans also like simple tools. Your phone is not a very simple tool. A fork is a simple tool. And we don't like them made of plastic  in the same way I don't really like my phone very much    it's not how I want to experience information. I think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens. I don't hate screens  but I don't feel    and I don't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them. Fortunately  the big tech companies seem to agree. They're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture  and also in senses    things that can turn dumb objects  like cups  and imbue them with the magic of the Internet  potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move. The parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read  as well as family safe app stores. And I think  actually  that's already really happening. Reality is richer than screens. For example  I love books. For me they are time machines    atoms and molecules bound in space  from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience. But frankly  the content's identical on my phone. So what makes this a richer experience than a screen  I mean  scientifically. We need screens  of course. I'm going to show film  I need the enormous screen. But there's more than you can do with these magic boxes. Your phone is not the Internet's door bitch. We can build things    physical things  using physics and pixels  that can integrate the Internet into the world around us. And I'm going to show you a few examples of those. A while ago  I got to work with a design agency  Berg  on an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like. And they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses and physical objects to really bring the Internet to life  to make it tangible. Like this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player. And this was an inspiration to me. Next I worked with the Japanese agency  AQ  on a research project into mental health. We wanted to create an object that could capture the subjective data around mood swings that's so essential to diagnosis. This object captures your touch  so you might press it very hard if you're angry  or stroke it if you're calm. It's like a digital emoji stick. And then you might revisit those moments later  and add context to them online. Most of all  we wanted to create an intimate  beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved. The binoculars are actually a birthday present for the Sydney Opera House's   th anniversary. Our friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars  the kind you might find on the Empire State Building  and they fitted them with     degree views of other iconic world heritage sights    using Street View. And then we stuck them under the steps. So  they became this very physical  simple reappropriation  or like a portal to these other icons. So you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut. Basically  it's virtual reality circa     . In our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs. This is incredibly simple  it's like your Opal card. You basically put a website on the little chip in here  and then you do this and ... bosh     the website appears on your phone. It's about    cents. Treehugger is a project that we're working on with Grumpy Sailor and Finch  here in Sydney. And I'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees  and that my children might have an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand  where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions  and be asked questions in return. As you can see  we're at the cardboard stage with this one. But I'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens  but with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips. And we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year. So let's recap. Humans like natural solutions. Humans love information. Humans need simple tools. These principles should underpin how we design for the future  not just for the Internet. You may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into. You may feel challenged  rather than simply excited. Guess what  Me too. It's a really extraordinary period of human history. We are the people that actually build our world  there are no artificial intelligences... yet. It's us    designers  architects  artists  engineers. And if we challenge ourselves  I think that actually we can have a happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb. And although it may seem inevitable  that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets  maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks. Thank you very much. I would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent. It is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth. It is largely unexplored  poorly understood  and the stuff of legends. But it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber  and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds. Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries    actually  we know also thanks to satellite technology  of course    we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface. However  we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth. Because a cave landscape  like this deep shaft in Italy  is hidden  the potential of cave exploration    the geographical dimension    is poorly understood and unappreciated. Because we are creatures living on the surface  our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed  as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere. However  since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago  we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world. A single cave system  like Mammoth Cave  which is in Kentucky  can be as long as more than     kilometers. And an abyss like Krubera Voronya  which is in the Caucasus region  actually the deepest cave explored in the world  can go as far as more than       meters below the surface. That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer. Caves form in karstic regions. So karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks  fractures  can easily dissolve soluble lithologies  forming a drainage system of tunnels  conduits    a three dimensional network  actually. Karstic regions cover almost    percent of the continents' surface  and we know actually that speleologists in the last    years have explored roughly        kilometers of cave passages around the world  which is a big number. But geologists have estimated that what is still missing  to be discovered and mapped  is something around    million kilometers. That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know  that we have explored  there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages. That means that this is really an endless continent  and we will never be able to explore it completely. And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves  like  for example  inside glaciers or even volcanic caves  which are not karstic  but are formed by lava flows. And if we have a look at other planets like  for example  Mars  you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet. However  I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds. I'm a speleologist  that means a cave explorer. And I started with this passion when I was really young in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy  in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites. But soon  the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet  searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent. And in       I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains  which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them. They are surrounded by vertical  vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest. They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness  with a soul older than millions and millions of years. And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Conan Doyle's  The Lost World  novel in     . And they are  really  a lost world. Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time  being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago. They are surrounded by up to       meter high walls  resembling a fortress  impregnable by humans. And  in fact  only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top. These mountains contain also a scientific paradox  They are made by quartz  which is a very common mineral on the earth's crust  and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite  and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth. So we do not expect at all to find a cave there. Despite this  in the last    years  speleologists from Italy  Slovakia  Czech Republic  and  of course  Venezuela and Brazil  have explored several caves in this area. So how can it be possible  To understand this contradiction  we have to consider the time factor  because the history of the tepuis is extremely long  starting about  .  billion years ago with the formation of the rock  and then evolving with the uplift of the region     million years ago  after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces  but also to open the fractures and form stone cities  rock cities  fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis. But nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame. And so I was focusing in      on one of those massifs  the Auy n tepui  which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls  which is the highest waterfall in the world    about     meters of vertical drop. And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems through satellite images  and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface    so  big boulders  rock piles    and that means that there was a void below. It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain. So we did several attempts to reach this area  by land and with a helicopter  but it was really difficult because    you have to imagine that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year  by fog. There are strong winds  and there are almost       millimeters of rainfall per year  so it's really  really difficult to find good conditions. And only in      we finally landed on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave. The cave is huge. It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau  and in only ten days of expedition  we explored more than    kilometers of cave passages. And it's a huge network of underground rivers  channels  big rooms  extremely deep shafts. So it's really an incredible place. And we named it Imawar  Yeuta. That means  in the Pem n indigenous language   The House of the Gods.  You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there. It was impossible for them to reach this area. However  there were legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain. So when we started the exploration  we had to explore with a great respect  both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people  but also because it was really a sacred place  because no human had entered there before. So we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence  and we tried also to share with the community  with the indigenous community  our discoveries. And the caves represent  really  a snapshot of the past. The time needed for their formation could be as long as    or even     million years  which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth. What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world. When you enter a quartzite cave  you have to completely forget what you know about caves    classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world. Because what seems a simple stalactite here is not made by calcium carbonate  but is made by opal  and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed. But you can find even stranger forms  like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder. And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave. We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things  things like those monster eggs. And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery  and we didn't want to find a dinosaur. We didn't find a dinosaur. Anyway  actually  we know that this kind of formation  after several studies  we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms. They are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures resembling stromatolites. Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth. And here in the tepuis  the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from the external surface  and without being in contact with humans. They have never been in contact with humans. So the implications for science are enormous  because here you could find  for example  microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine  or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties. And  in fact  we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science  which is rossiantonite  a phosphate sulfate. So whatever you find in the cave  even a small cricket  has evolved in the dark in complete isolation. And  really  everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world. So as we explore this dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness  we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world. What seems only a dark  empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information. With a team of Italian  Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists  which is called La Venta Teraphosa  we will be back soon to Latin America  because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon. There are still very unknown mountains  like Marahuaca  which is almost       meters high above sea level  or Arac   which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil. And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems  and each one with its own undiscovered world. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget. Francesco  you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life  and indeed  last time we spoke  you were in Sardinia and you were training European astronauts. So what do you  a speleologist  tell and teach to the astronauts  Francesco Sauro  Yeah  we are    it's a program of training for not only European  but also NASA  Roskosmos  JAXA astronauts  in a cave. So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation. They have to work together in a real  real dangerous environment  and it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual. It's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks. And it's very similar to a journey to Mars or the International Space Station. BG  In principle. FS  Yes. BG  I want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show  and it's just representative of the other photos    Weren't those photos amazing  Yeah  Audience  Yeah  FS  I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta  because all of those photos are from the photographers. BG  You bring  actually  photographers with you in the expedition. They're professionals  they're speleologists and photographers. But when I look at these pictures  I wonder  there is zero light down there  and yet they look incredibly well exposed. How do you take these pictures  How do your colleagues  the photographers  take these pictures  FS  Yeah. They are working in a darkroom  basically  so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment. BG  So you're basically    FS  Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment. The final result is what you want to achieve. BG  You spray the environment with light and that's what you get. Maybe we can try this at home someday  I don't know. BG  Francesco  grazie. FS  Grazie. I want to tell you three stories about the power of relationships to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century. You know  sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty  inequality  ill health  unemployment  violence  addiction    they're right there in one person's life. So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know. I'm going to call her Ella. Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate. The shops are closed  the pub's gone  the playground's pretty desolate and never used  and inside Ella's house  the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening. The TV's on at full volume. One of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters. Another son  Ryan  is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen  and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining. Ella is stuck. She has lived with crisis for    years. She knows nothing else  and she knows no way out. She's had a whole series of abusive partners  and  tragically  one of her children has been taken into care by social services. The three children that still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems  and none of them are in education. And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother's life before her. But when I met Ella  there were    different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives     different services run out of    departments in one city  and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them. They think nothing of calling social services to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out. And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers  youth workers  a health officer  a housing officer  a home tutor and the local policemen. And the governments say that there are         families in Britain today like Ella's  struggling to break the cycle of economic  social and environmental deprivation. And they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes. None of these well meaning visitors are making a difference. This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's. This shows    years of intervention in that family's life. And just as with Ella  not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan. There's no end goal in sight. None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues. These are just containment measures  ways of managing a problem. One of the policemen says to me   Look  I just deliver the message and then I leave.  So  I've spent time living with families like Ella's in different parts of the world  because I want to know  what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren't working  I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family. I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently. Well  the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept. Because when the government says that a family like Ella's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage  what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year. Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family in a way that makes a difference. Instead  the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families  keeping them stuck at its heart  exactly where they are. And I also spent time with the frontline workers  and I learned that it is an impossible situation. So Tom  who is the social worker for Ella's    year old son Ryan  has to spend    percent of his time servicing the system  meetings with colleagues  filling out forms  more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms  and maybe most shockingly  the    percent of the time he has to be with Ryan is spent getting data and information for the system. So he says to Ryan   How often have you been smoking  Have you been drinking  When did you go to school   And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation. It rules out the possibility of what's needed to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan. When we made this chart  the frontline workers  the professionals    they stared at it absolutely amazed. It snaked around the walls of their offices. So many hours  so well meant  but ultimately so futile. And there was this moment of absolute breakdown  and then of clarity  we had to work in a different way. So in a really brave step  the leaders of the city where Ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio. So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's would spend    percent of their time working with the families and only    percent servicing the system. And even more radically  the families would lead and they would decide who was in a best position to help them. So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel  to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them. And many  many people wanted to join us  because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system  you go in because you can and you want to make a difference. So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door   What will you do when my son starts kicking me   And so the first person who comes in says   Well  I'll look around for the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly  and if the noise is still going on  I'll call my supervisor.  And the mothers go   You're the system. Get out of here   And then the next person who comes is a policeman  and he says   Well  I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do.  And the mothers say   Thank you.  So  they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers  who said    well  they weren't going to talk in jargon. They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin  even though they wouldn't be soft with them. So these new teams and the families were then given a sliver of the former budget  but they could spend the money in any way they chose. And so one of the families went out for supper. They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time. Another family asked the team if they would help them do up their home. And one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise. And in a really short space of time  something new started to grow  a relationship between the team and the workers. And then some remarkable changes took place. Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards. But today  she's completed an IT training course  she has her first paid job  her children are back in school  and the neighbors  who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them  are fine. They've made some new friendships. And all the same people have been involved in this transformation    same families  same workers. But the relationship between them has been supported to change. So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems. But today  our relationships are all but written off by our politics  our social policies  our welfare institutions. And I've learned that this really has to change. So what do I mean by relationships  I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us  a kind of authentic sense of connection  of belonging  the bonds that make us happy  that support us to change  to be brave like Ella and try something new. And  you know  it's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions that are supposed to support Ella and her family don't talk about relationships  because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world. The contemporaries of William Beveridge  who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report  had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man. Instead  they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system. And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just can't be underestimated. The Beveridge Report sold over         copies in the first weeks of publication alone. People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy  and it was read across the country  across the colonies  across Europe  across the United States of America  and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe. The cultures  the bureaucracies  the institutions    they are global  and they've come to seem like common sense. They've become so ingrained in us  that actually we don't even see them anymore. And I think it's really important to say that in the   th century  they were remarkably successful  these institutions. They led to longer lifespans  the eradication of mass disease  mass housing  almost universal education. But at the same time  Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges. So let me tell you a second story. What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking  It's loneliness. According to government statistics  one person over       one in three    doesn't speak to or see another person in a week. One person in     that's         people  doesn't speak to anyone else in a month. And we're not the only people with this problem  this problem touches the whole of the Western world. And it's even more acute in countries like China  where a process of rapid urbanization  mass migration  has left older people alone in the villages. And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported    they can't address this kind of problem. Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge  and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response. So some years ago  wanting to understand this problem  I started to work with a group of about    older people in South London  where I live. I went shopping  I played bingo  but mainly I was just observing and listening. I wanted to know what we could do differently. And if you ask them  people tell you they want two things. They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb  or to be there when they come out of hospital. They want on demand  practical support. And they want to have fun. They want to go out  do interesting things with like minded people  and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives. So we rented a phone line  hired a couple of handymen  and started a service we called  Circle.  And Circle offers its local membership a toll free       number that they can call on demand for any support. And people have called us for so many reasons. They've called because their pets are unwell  their DVD is broken  they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone  or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there. And Circle also offers a rich social calendar    knitting  darts  museum tours  hot air ballooning    you name it. But here's the interesting thing  the really deep change  over time  the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer. So let me tell you about Belinda. Belinda's a Circle member  and she was going into hospital for a hip operation  so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit. And Damon  who runs the local Circle  calls her back and says   How can I help   And Belinda says   Oh no  I'm fine    Jocelyn is doing the shopping  Tony's doing the gardening  Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat.  So five Circle members had organized themselves to take care of Belinda. And Belinda's     although she says that she feels    inside  but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle. But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed  friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services. It's relationships that are making the difference. So I think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems today. Firstly  the nature of the problems    they've changed  and they require different solutions. Secondly  the cost  human as much as financial  of doing business as usual. And thirdly  technology. I've talked about the first two factors. It's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people. So the technology we've used is really simple  it's made up of available things like databases  mobile phones. Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it  enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand. And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the     s  when this kind of scale just wasn't possible  neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide. So it's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads. The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources  anonymously managing access. In my work at the front line  I've seen again and again how up to    percent of resource is spent keeping people out. So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service or managing the queue. And Circle  like the relational services that we and others have designed  inverts this logic. What it says is  the more people  the more relationships  the stronger the solution. So I want to tell you my third and final story  which is about unemployment. In Britain  as in most places in the world  our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work  to educate them for this  and to keep them healthy. But here  too  the systems are failing. And so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional    to speed up processing times  divide people into ever smaller categories  try and target services at them more efficiently    in other words  the very opposite of relational. But guess how most people find work today  Through word of mouth. It turns out that in Britain today  most new jobs are not advertised. So it's friends that tell you about a job  it's friends that recommend you for a job  and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work. Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking   But I found my job through an advert   but if you think back  it was probably a friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply. But not surprisingly  people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it. So knowing this  and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems  we designed something new with relationships at its heart. We designed a service that encourages people to meet up  people in and out of work  to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities. And  well  it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models  but it looks like  with our first       members  we outperformed existing services by a factor of three  at a fraction of the cost. And here  too  we've used technology  but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do. We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other  building real relationships and supporting people to find work. At the end of his life  in       Beveridge wrote a third report. And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake. He had left people and their communities out. And this omission  he said  led to seeing people  and people starting to see themselves  within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions. And human relationships were already withering. But unfortunately  this third report was much less read than Beveridge's earlier work. But today  we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services  in an approach that I call  Relational Welfare.  We need to leave behind these old  transactional  unsuitable  outdated models  and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like Ella's  that can address an issue like loneliness  that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market  that can also address challenges of education  of health care systems  and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies. It is all about relationships. Relationships are the critical resource we have. Thank you. When I was a kid  my parents would tell me   You can make a mess  but you have to clean up after yourself.  So freedom came with responsibility. But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places  where everything was possible. So I grew up in a bubble of innocence    or a bubble of ignorance  I should say  because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth. And growing up  I found out that adults make a mess  and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves. Fast forward  I am an adult now  and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School. And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash. So as good citizens  we clean up the beaches    and no  he is not drinking alcohol  and if he is  I did not give it to him. And so it's sad to say  but today more than    percent  of the oceans have plastic in them. It's a horrifying fact. And in past decades  we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets  and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope  and we sort them  and then we put this data onto a map. But that takes forever  it's very expensive  and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out. So with my students  ages six to     we've been dreaming of inventing a better way. So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop. And so we started building this small workbench  with different heights  so even really short kids can participate. And let me tell you  kids with power tools are awesome and safe. Not really. And so  back to plastic. We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean  which is very small because it breaks down. And so this is how we work. I let the imaginations of my students run wild. And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work. And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits  we are going to collect only the data. So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot    so robots  kids get very excited. And the next thing we do    we do what we call  rapid prototyping.  We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it. And we hack table lamps and webcams  into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there    and this is the image that we get in the robot. So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor  and the computer on board will process this image  and measure the size of each particle  so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water. So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables  in the hope that somebody would make it even better. What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem  and boom    they are trying to immediately address it.  I can investigate my local problem  But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids. And they watch the news  they watch the Internet  and they came across this image. This was a child  probably under     cleaning up an oil spill bare handed  in the Sundarbans  which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh. So they were very shocked  because this is the water they drink  this is the water they bathe in  this is the water they fish in    this is the place where they live. And also you can see the water is brown  the mud is brown and oil is brown  so when everything is mixed up  it's really hard to see what's in the water. But  there's a technology that's rather simple  that's called spectrometry  that allows you see what's in the water. So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer  and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums  so that can help you identify what's in the water. So we packed this prototype of a sensor  and we shipped it to Bangladesh. So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem  or looking at a local problem  my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help  remotely  other kids.  I can investigate a remote problem  So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments  and I wanted to take it even further    maybe addressing an even harder problem  and it's also closer to my heart. So I'm half Japanese and half French  and maybe you remember in      there was a massive earthquake in Japan. It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves    they are called tsunami    and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan. More than        people died in an instant. Also  it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima  the nuclear power plant just by the water. And today  I read the reports and an average of     tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium    . If you go outside on the West Coast  you can measure Fukushima everywhere. But if you look at the map  it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast  and most of it is now    it looks like it's safe  it's blue. Well  reality is a bit more complicated than this. So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident  and I measure independently and with other scientists  on land  in the river    and this time we wanted to take the kids. So of course we didn't take the kids  the parents wouldn't allow that to happen. But every night we would report to  Mission Control     different masks they're wearing. It could look like they didn't take the work seriously  but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life. And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day  and talk about where we should be going next    strategy  itinerary  etc... And to do this  we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant. And so we built the elevation map  we sprinkled pigments to represent real time data for radioactivity  and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall. And with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system  and leaking into the ocean. So it was a rough estimate. But with this in mind  we organized this expedition  which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant. We are sailing  .  kilometers away from the nuclear power plant  and with the help of the local fisherman  we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built. We pack the sediment into small bags  we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities  and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity  especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce  and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi. You can see a progression here    we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem. And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales  with also very simple  open source technologies. But at the same time  it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done. We haven't even started to try to solve the problems. And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things. And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small  so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong  and we turned it into the largest mega space focused on social and environmental impact. It's in central Hong Kong  and it's a place we can work with wood  metal  chemistry  a bit of biology  a bit of optics  basically you can build pretty much everything there. And its a place where adults and kids can play together. It's a place where kids' dreams can come true  with the help of adults  and where adults can be kids again. Student  Acceleration  Acceleration  Cesar Harada  We're asking questions such as  can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy  For example. Or  can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool  electric vehicles  So plastic  oil and radioactivity are horrible  horrible legacies  but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies. We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions. So citizen scientists  makers  dreamers    we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people  and that can actually do something about it. Thank you. Interpreter  Piano   p   is my favorite musical symbol. It means to play softly. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a  p  in the score  you need to play softer. Two p's    even softer. Four p's    extremely soft. This is my drawing of a p tree  which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be  you'll never reach complete silence. That's my current definition of silence  a very obscure sound. I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language  ASL  plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early     s  and as time went by  mixed with local signs  it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. So it has a history of about     years. I was born deaf  and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. And I believed it to be true. Yet  I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. Sound was very much a part of my life  really  on my mind every day. As a Deaf person living in a world of sound  it's as if I was living in a foreign country  blindly following its rules  customs  behaviors and norms without ever questioning them. So how is it that I understand sound  Well  I watch how people behave and respond to sound. You people are like my loudspeakers  and amplify sound. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time  I've learned that I create sound  and I've seen how people respond to me. Thus I've learned  for example ...  Don't slam the door    Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato chip bag    Don't burp  and when you're eating  make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate.  All of these things I term  sound etiquette.  Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. I'm hyper vigilant around sound. And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound  about what's to come next. Hence  this drawing. TBD  to be decided. TBC  to be continued. TBA  to be announced. And you notice the staff    there are no notes contained in the lines. That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears. In Deaf culture  movement is equivalent to sound. This is a sign for  staff  in ASL. A typical staff contains five lines. Yet for me  signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. That's why you'll notice in my drawings  I stick to four lines on paper. In the year       I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin  Germany  for an artist residency there. Prior to this time  I had been working as a painter. During this summer  I visited different museums and gallery spaces  and as I went from one place to the next  I noticed there was no visual art there. At that time  sound was trending  and this struck me ... there was no visual art  everything was auditory. Now sound has come into my art territory. Is it going to further distance me from art  I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. I actually know sound. I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. It could be felt tactually  or experienced as a visual  or even as an idea. So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. And everything that I had been taught regarding sound  I decided to do away with and unlearn. I started creating a new body of work. And when I presented this to the art community  I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. I realized  sound is like money  power  control    social currency. In the back of my mind  I've always felt that sound was your thing  a hearing person's thing. And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork  or it could empower me. I chose to be empowered. There's a massive culture around spoken language. And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate  in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. And that way  I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today. So at school  at work and institutions  I work with many different ASL interpreters. And their voice becomes my voice and identity. They help me to be heard. And their voices hold value and currency. Ironically  by borrowing out their voices  I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency  kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. If I didn't continue this practice  I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency. So with sound as my new art medium  I delved into the world of music. And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. For example  a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. They're both highly spatial and highly inflected    meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds. I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor  to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. So  envision a piano. ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano    such as facial expression  body movement  speed  hand shape and so on  as you play the piano    English is a linear language  as if one key is being pressed at a time. However  ASL is more like a chord    all    fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. If just one of those keys were to change the chord  it would create a completely different meaning. The same applies to music in regards to pitch  tone and volume. In ASL  by playing around with these different grammatical parameters  you can express different ideas. For example  take the sign TO LOOK AT. This is the sign TO LOOK AT. I'm looking at you. Staring at you. Oh    busted. Uh oh. What are you looking at  Aw  stop. I then started thinking   What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens   If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over  it could become like a piece of visual music. For example  this is the sign for  day   as the sun rises and sets. This is  all day.  If I was to repeat it and slow it down  visually it looks like a piece of music. All ... day. I feel the same holds true for  all night.   All night.  This is ALL NIGHT  represented in this drawing. And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights   last night    overnight   I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two. This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. For example   H is one hand   H is two hand  present tense happens closest and in front of the body  future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. So  the first example is  a long time ago.  Then  past    used to  and the last one  which is my favorite  with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it   once upon a time.   Common time  is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. Yet when I see the word  common time   what automatically comes to mind for me is  at the same time.  So notice RH  right hand  LH  left hand. We have the staff across the head and the chest.  Head  RH  Flash claw   Common time   Chest  LH  Flash claw  I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the  flash claw.  Can you please follow along with me  Everybody  hands up. Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest  kind of like  common time  or at the same time. Yes  got it. That means  to fall in love  in International  Sign . International  Sign   as a note  is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world. The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this    please follow along with me again. And now this. This is  colonization  in ASL. Now the third    please follow along again. And again. This is  enlightenment  in ASL. So let's do all three together.  Fall in love    colonization  and  enlightenment.  Good job  everyone. Notice how all three signs are very similar  they all happen at the head and the chest  but they convey quite different meanings. So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving  just like music is. However  in this day and age  we live in a very audio centric world. And just because ASL has no sound to it  it automatically holds no social currency. We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency    without sound. And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL  nor do you have to be hearing to learn music. ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. And I'd like to invite you to open your ears  to open your eyes  take part in our culture and experience our visual language. And you never know  you might just fall in love with us. Thank you. Denise Kahler Braaten  Hey  that's me. A year ago  we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin to present our art projects. We are used to invitations  but this invitation really thrilled us. The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special. It is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the Second World War  and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery. No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats. The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag    Germany's parliament    and the Brandenburg Gate  and right next to the gate there are other embassies  in particular the US and the British Embassy. Although Germany is an advanced democracy  citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district. The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there. And this is interesting from an artistic point of view. The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation. With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations  we can gain a new perspective. The given terms and conditions shape our perception  our actions and our lives. And this is crucial in another context. Over the last couple of years  we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy  the secret services have been listening to the entire district  including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel. The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome  while the listening post of the American NSA is covered by radio transparent screens. But how to address these hidden and disguised forces  With my colleague  Christoph Wachter  we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy. And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation. If people are spying on us  it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying. On the roof of the Swiss Embassy  we installed a series of antennas. They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British. They were makeshift can antennas  not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible. The Academy of Arts joined the project  and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop  exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ. Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation. A helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made  and on the roof of the US Embassy  security officers patrolled. Although the government district is governed by a strict police order  there are no specific laws relating to digital communication. Our installation was therefore perfectly legal  and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it. We named the project  Can You Hear Me   The antennas created an open and free Wi Fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any Wi Fi enabled device without any hindrance  and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted. Text messages  voice chat  file sharing    anything could be sent anonymously. And people did communicate. Over        messages were sent. Here are some examples.  Hello world  hello Berlin  hello NSA  hello GCHQ.   NSA Agents  Do the Right Thing  Blow the whistle    This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track          nonymous is watching  NSA  GCHQ   we are part of your organizations.   expect us. We will  shutdown   This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks.   Agents  what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren     NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike.   Make Love  Not cyberwar.  We invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network  too  and to our surprise  they did. Files appeared on the network  including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission  which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult  even for members of a parliament. We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on site. The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies  and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication. If we become aware of the constellation  the terms and conditions of communication  it not only broadens our horizon  it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview  our specific social  political or aesthetic conventions. Let's look at an actual example. The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of Paris is hidden and faded from view. It's a vicious circle. It's not poverty  not racism  not exclusion that are new. What is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange. Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal  and therefore those living in them don't have a chance of making their voices heard. On the contrary  every time they appear  every time they risk becoming visible  merely gives grounds for further persecution  expulsion and suppression. What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side. We were searching for an interface and we found one. It's not a digital interface  but a physical one  it's a hotel. We named the project  Hotel Gelem.  Together with Roma families  we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe  for example  in Freiburg in Germany  in Montreuil near Paris  and also in the Balkans. These are real hotels. People can stay there. But they aren't a commercial enterprise. They are a symbol. You can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem  in their homes  eating  working and living with the Roma families. Here  the Roma families are not the travelers  the visitors are. Here  the Roma families are not a minority  the visitors are. The point is not to make judgments  but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions. In the world of globalization  the continents are drifting closer to each other. Cultures  goods and people are in permanent exchange  but at the same time  the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing. We were recently in Australia. For us  it was no problem to enter the country. We have European passports  visas and air tickets. But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison. The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities. These procedures are declared to be secret military operations. After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones  men  women and children are detained by Australia without trial  sometimes for years. During our stay  however  we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned  despite strict screening and isolation. From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane. On the face of it  it was a very simple installation. On the floor  a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center  accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility. But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity. Above every floor marking  there was a headset. Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation. In the protected context of the art exhibition  asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves  their story and their situation  without fear of consequences. Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart  about dramatic escapes from war zones  about suicide attempts  about the fate of children in detention. Emotions ran deep. Many wept. Several revisited the exhibition. It was a powerful experience. Europe is now facing a stream of migrants. The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses. We have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece. They are all about providing basic information    medical costs  legal information  guidance. But they are significant. Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored  and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized. This brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin and the  Can You Hear Me   project. We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected. We should start making our own connections  fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world. This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces. It is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you  Mathias. The other half of your artistic duo is also here. Christoph Wachter  come onstage. First  tell me just a detail  the name of the hotel is not a random name. Gelem means something specific in the Roma language. Mathias Jud  Yes   Gelem  Gelem  is the title of the Romani hymn  the official  and it means  I went a long way.  BG  That's just to add the detail to your talk. But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently  you're just back a couple of days ago  in Greece  where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months. What did you see there and what did you do there  Christoph Wachter  Well  Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey  and during our stay  many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies  and after landing  they were left completely on their own. They are denied many services. For example  they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room  so many families literally sleep in the streets. And we installed networks there to allow basic communication  because I think  I believe  it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees  I think we need to start talking to them. And by doing so  we can realize that it is about human beings  about their lives and their struggle to survive. BG  And allow them to talk as well. Christoph  thank you for coming to TED. Mathias  thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story. A few years ago  I broke into my own house. I had just driven home  it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter  I had been visiting my friend  Jeff  across town  and the thermometer on the front porch read minus    degrees    and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit  minus    is where the two scales meet    it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets  I found I didn't have my keys. In fact  I could see them through the window  lying on the dining room table where I had left them. So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows  and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith    at least I had my cellphone  but at midnight  it could take a while for a locksmith to show up  and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning  and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase. So  desperate and freezing cold  I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window  cleared out the shards of glass  I crawled through  I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening  figuring that in the morning  on the way to the airport  I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive  but probably no more expensive than a middle of the night locksmith  so I figured  under the circumstances  I was coming out even. Now  I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate  it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning  when I woke up on too little sleep  worrying about the hole in the window  and a mental note that I had to call my contractor  and the freezing temperatures  and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe  and  you know  with all the cortisol in my brain  my thinking was cloudy  but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy. And it wasn't until I got to the airport check in counter  that I realized I didn't have my passport. So I raced home in the snow and ice     minutes  got my passport  raced back to the airport  I made it just in time  but they had given away my seat to someone else  so I got stuck in the back of the plane  next to the bathrooms  in a seat that wouldn't recline  on an eight hour flight. Well  I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep. And I started wondering  are there things that I can do  systems that I can put into place  that will prevent bad things from happening  Or at least if bad things happen  will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that  but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague  Danny Kahneman  the Nobel Prize winner  and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window  and  you know  forgotten my passport  and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight. It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein  who had written about it a few years before  also called the pre mortem. Now  you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster  a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong  right  Well  in the pre mortem  Danny explained  you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong  and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening  or to minimize the damage. So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre mortem. Some of them are obvious  some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones. Around the home  designate a place for things that are easily lost. Now  this sounds like common sense  and it is  but there's a lot of science to back this up  based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus  that evolved over tens of thousands of years  to keep track of the locations of important things    where the well is  where fish can be found  that stand of fruit trees  where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering  somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels  and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell  they were using the hippocampus  this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things that don't move around much  not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports. So in the home  designate a spot for your keys    a hook by the door  maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport  a particular drawer. For your reading glasses  a particular table. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it  your things will always be there when you look for them. What about travel  Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards  your driver's license  your passport  mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen  you can facilitate replacement. Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember  when you're under stress  the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic  and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best  and you should put systems in place. And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make. And at some point  all of us are going to be in that position  where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one  to help them with a decision. And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision making  and indeed for financial decision making  and social decision making    any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts. So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says   I just got your lab work back  your cholesterol's a little high.  Now  you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease  heart attack  stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing  and so the doctor says   You know  I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol  a statin.  And you've probably heard of statins  you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today  you probably even know people who take them. And so you're thinking   Yeah  Give me the statin.  But there's a question you should ask at this point  a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about  and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now  what is this  the NNT  It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking  what kind of crazy statistic is that  The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually  medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault  if it's anybody's fault  it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that    percent of the drugs work in only    to    percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin  what do you suppose it is  How many people have to take it before one person is helped     . This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband  independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself.     people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack  stroke or other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking   Well  OK  one in     chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not  doc  Give me the prescription anyway.  But you should ask at this point for another statistic  and that is   Tell me about the side effects.  Right  So for this particular drug  the side effects occur in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things    debilitating muscle and joint pain  gastrointestinal distress    but now you're thinking   Five percent  not very likely it's going to happen to me  I'll still take the drug.  But wait a minute. Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time  so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.     people take the drug  right  One person's helped  five percent of those     have side effects  that's    people. You're    times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug. Now  I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it  it's part of the principle of informed consent. You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not. Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value  but in fact it's rather typical  this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of     removal of the prostate for cancer  the number needed to treat is   . That's right     surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case occur in    percent of the patients. They include impotence  erectile dysfunction  urinary incontinence  rectal tearing  fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky  and you're one of the    percent who has these  they'll only last for a year or two. So the idea of the pre mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot. And you also want to think about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes  do you I want a shorter life that's pain free  or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end  These are things to talk about and think about now  with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind in the heat of the moment  but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking. Remember  our brain under stress releases cortisol  and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face to face with a predator  you don't need your digestive system  or your libido  or your immune system  because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly  you might become the lion's lunch  and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately  one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational  logical thinking  as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations. I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be  to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage  or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place. Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal  when I got back from my trip  I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door  with a key to the front door in it  an easy to remember combination. And I have to admit  I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted  and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized  but I see organization as a gradual process  and I'm getting there. Thank you very much. A girl I've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people. I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org. It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people. In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States. And we're not homophobic. And it's true    the way we communicate with young people is by text  because that's how young people communicate. So we'll run over     campaigns this year  things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries  or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound. And we'll text them. And we'll have a    percent open rate. It'll over index Hispanic and urban. We collected         jars of peanut butter and over         Valentine's Day cards. This is big scale. OK    But there's one weird side effect. Every time we send out a text message  we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens    but text messages about being bullied  text messages about being addicted to pot. And the worst message we ever got said exactly this   He won't stop raping me. It's my dad. He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there   We couldn't believe this was happening. We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being  and that she would share it with us    something so intimate  so personal. And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain. So we launched Crisis Text Line  very quietly  in Chicago and El Paso    just a few thousand people in each market. And in four months  we were in all     area codes in America. Just to put that into perspective  that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched. Text is unbelievably private. No one hears you talking. So we spike everyday at lunch time    kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall  but she's actually texting us about her bulimia. And we don't get the word  like  or  um  or hyperventilating or crying. We just get facts. We get things like   I want to die. I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me.  And so the crisis counselor says   How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text   And they go back and forth for a while. And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address  because if you're texting a text line  you want help. So she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth. And then it goes quiet       minutes with no response from this girl. And the next message that comes in says    it's the mom     I had no idea  and I was in the house  we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital.  As a mom that one just    The next message comes a month later.  I just got out of the hospital. I was diagnosed as bipolar  and I think I'm going to be OK.  I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange  but we're doing on average  .   active rescues a day. Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression    huge. The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues  and getting them from hot moments to cold moments. It's exciting  and I will tell you that we have done a total of more than  .  million text messages in less than two years. But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this  the thing that really gets me psyched is the data   .  million messages    that's the volume  velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus. We can do things like predictive work. We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set. So we can be better  and the world can be better. So how do we use the data to make us better  Alright  chances are someone here  someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life    you do not have to raise your hand. How do you know that person's any good  Oh  they have a degree from Harvard on the wall  Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom    percent  When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor  I thought she was a genius when she said   I'll see you guys in two weeks    but I need to see you next week  sir.  We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. We know that if you text the words  numbs  and  sleeve   there's a    percent match for cutting. We know that if you text in the words  mg  and  rubber band   there's a    percent match for substance abuse. And we know that if you text in  sex    oral  and  Mormon   you're questioning if you're gay. Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop up says      percent match for cutting    try asking one of these questions  to prompt the counselor. Or     percent match for substance abuse  here are three drug clinics near the texter.  It makes us more accurate. On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide  people flooded hotlines all over this country. It was sad to see an icon  a funnyman  commit suicide  and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country. We had a spike in volume also. The difference was if you text us   I want to die   or  I want to kill myself   the algorithm reads that  you're code orange  and you become number one in the queue. So we can handle severity  not chronological. This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real time crises. Think about it  those  .  million messages  auto tagging through natural language processes  all of these data points    I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders  Monday. The worst time of day for substance abuse   am. And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there  because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation. And we've made this data public and free and open. We've pulled all the personally identifiable information. And it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org. Because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders  so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays. And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at  am. I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana. Data  evidence makes policy  research  journalism  policing  school boards    everything better. I don't think of myself as a mental health activist. I think of myself as a national health activist. I get really excited about this data  I'm a little nerdy. Yeah  that sounded too girly. I'm nerdy. I love data. And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat funded companies  is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at  am in Dallas  or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately  or swipe right and get laid. I'm inspired    I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place. I want to use it to help that girl  who texted in about  being raped by her father. Because the truth is we never heard from her again. And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy  and I hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line and inspires me every freaking day. Every day  I listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives  across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas. But there's one story that keeps me awake at night  and it's about Doaa. A Syrian refugee     years old  she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb. And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them. And one day  men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her. Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future  now she was scared all the time. But she was also full of hope  because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem. Bassem was also struggling in Egypt  and he said to Doaa   Let's go to Europe  seek asylum  safety. I will work  you can study    the promise of a new life.  And he asked her father for her hand in marriage. But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives  traveling across the Mediterranean Sea  putting their hands in smugglers'  notorious for their cruelty. And Doaa was terrified of the water. She always had been. She never learned to swim. It was August that year  and already       people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean  but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe  and she thought   Maybe we can  too.  So she asked her parents if they could go  and after a painful discussion  they consented  and Bassem paid his entire life savings          dollars each    to the smugglers. It was a Saturday morning when the call came  and they were taken by bus to a beach  hundreds of people on the beach. They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat      of them crammed onto that boat      below        above. There were Syrians  Palestinians  Africans  Muslims and Christians      children  including Sandra    little Sandra  six years old    and Masa     months. There were families on that boat  crammed together shoulder to shoulder  feet to feet. Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest  Bassem holding her hand. Day two on the water  they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea. Day three  Doaa had a premonition. And she said to Bassem   I fear we're not going to make it. I fear the boat is going to sink.  And Bassem said to her   Please be patient. We will make it to Sweden  we will get married and we will have a future.  Day four  the passengers were getting agitated. They asked the captain   When will we get there   He told them to shut up  and he insulted them. He said   In    hours we will reach the shores of Italy.  They were weak and weary. Soon they saw a boat approach    a smaller boat     men on board  who started shouting at them  hurling insults  throwing sticks  asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller  more unseaworthy boat. The parents were terrified for their children  and they collectively refused to disembark. So the boat sped away in anger  and a half an hour later  came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat  just below where she and Bassem were sitting. And she heard how they yelled   Let the fish eat your flesh   And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank. The     people below deck were doomed. Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank  and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller. Bassem said to her   Please let go  or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you  too.  And remember    she can't swim. But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs  thinking   This is swimming.  And miraculously  Bassem found a life ring. It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas. And Doaa climbed onto the ring  her arms and her legs dangling by the side. Bassem was a good swimmer  so he held her hand and tread water. Around them there were corpses. Around     people survived initially  and they started coming together in groups  praying for rescue. But when a day went by and no one came  some people gave up hope  and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water. One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder  nine months old    Malek. He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat  and he said to them   I fear I am not going to survive. I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore.  And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa  and they perched her onto the life ring. So now they were three  Doaa  Bassem and little Malek. And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question  why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks  Millions of refugees are living in exile  in limbo. They're living in countries  fleeing  from a war that has been raging for four years. Even if they wanted to return  they can't. Their homes  their businesses  their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed. This is a UNESCO World Heritage City  Homs  in Syria. So people continue to flee into neighboring countries  and we build refugee camps for them in the desert. Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these  and thousands and thousands more  millions  live in towns and cities. And the communities  the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed. There are simply not enough schools  water systems  sanitation. Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment. The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders  but over seven million people are on the run inside the country. That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee. Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many. They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them. And days have turned into months  months into years. A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary. Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water. It was their second day  and Bassem was getting very weak. And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem   My love  please hold on to hope  to our future. We will make it.  And he said to her   I'm sorry  my love  that I put you in this situation. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.  And he released himself into the water  and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes. Later that day  a mother came up to Doaa with her small    month old daughter  Masa. This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier  with the life vests. Her older sister Sandra had just drowned  and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. And she said to Doaa   Please take this child. Let her be part of you. I will not survive.  And then she went away and drowned. So Doaa  the    year old refugee who was terrified of the water  who couldn't swim  found herself in charge of two little baby kids. And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated  and she tried her best to amuse them  to sing to them  to say words to them from the Quran. Around them  the bodies were bloating and turning black. The sun was blazing during the day. At night  there was a cold moon and fog. It was very frightening. On the fourth day in the water  this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children. A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child    a little boy  just four years old. When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned  she said to the sobbing child   She just went away to find you water and food.  But his heart soon stopped  and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water. Later that day  she looked up into the sky with hope  because she saw two planes crossing in the sky. And she waved her arms  hoping they would see her  but the planes were soon gone. But that afternoon  as the sun was going down  she saw a boat  a merchant vessel. And she said   Please  God  let them rescue me.  She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours. And it had become dark  but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope  astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies. They pulled them onto the boat  they got oxygen and blankets  and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete. But Doaa looked down and asked   What of Malek   And they told her the little baby did not survive    she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic. But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat  that little baby girl had been smiling. Only    people survived that wreck  of the    . There was never an international investigation into what happened. There were some media reports about mass murder at sea  a terrible tragedy  but that was only for one day. And then the news cycle moved on. Meanwhile  in a pediatric hospital on Crete  little Masa was on the edge of death. She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing. Her glucose levels were dangerously low. The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them  and the Greek nurses never left her side  holding her  hugging her  singing her words. My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic. Amazingly  little Masa survived. And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby  who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink  and offers to adopt her came from all over the country. And meanwhile  Doaa was in another hospital on Crete  thin  dehydrated. An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released. And soon word went around about Doaa's survival  and a phone number was published on Facebook. Messages started coming in.  Doaa  do you know what happened to my brother  My sister  My parents  My friends  Do you know if they survived   One of those messages said   I believe you saved my little niece  Masa.  And it had this photo. This was from Masa's uncle  a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister. Soon  we hope  Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden  and until then  she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens. And Doaa  Well  word went around about her survival  too. And the media wrote about this slight woman  and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea  and still save another life. The Academy of Athens  one of Greece's most prestigious institutions  gave her an award of bravery  and she deserves all that praise  and she deserves a second chance. But she wants to still go to Sweden. She wants to reunite with her family there. She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well  and I believe she will succeed. She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice. She is an extraordinary survivor. But I have to ask  what if she didn't have to take that risk  Why did she have to go through all that  Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe  Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden  Why couldn't Bassem have found work  Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees  the victims of the worst war of our times  The world did this for the Vietnamese in the     s. Why not now  Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees  And why  the root question  is so little being done to stop the wars  the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe  Until these issues are resolved  people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum. And what happens next  Well  that is largely Europe's choice. And I understand the public fears. People are worried about their security  their economies  the changes of culture. But is that more important than saving human lives  Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest  and it is about our common humanity. No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety. One thing is for sure  that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are. And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children. And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate. So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those     people who drowned with them  can we make sure that they did not die in vain  Could we be inspired by what happened  and take a stand for a world in which every life matters  Thank you. This is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth. This is a tapir. Now this  this is a baby tapir  the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom. By far. There is no competition here. I have dedicated the past    years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil  and it has been absolutely amazing. But at the moment  I've been thinking really  really hard about the impact of my work. I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made for the conservation of these animals I love so much. Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival  Am I doing enough  I guess the big question here is  am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation  or am I just documenting their extinction  The world is facing so many different conservation crises. We all know that. It's all over the news every day. Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed  climate change  so many species on the brink of extinction  tigers  lions  elephants  rhinos  tapirs. This is the lowland tapir  the tapir species I work with  the largest terrestrial mammal of South America. They're massive. They're powerful. Adults can weigh up to     kilos. That's half the size of a horse. They're gorgeous. Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon  and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive. But their habitat is being destroyed  and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution. And you see  this is very  very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found. They're herbivores. Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit  and when they eat the fruit  they swallow the seeds  which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. They play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest  and for that reason  tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest. Isn't that amazing  If you think about it  the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole. I started my tapir work in       still very young  fresh out of college  and it was a pioneer research and conservation program. At that point  we had nearly zero information about tapirs  mostly because they're so difficult to study. They're nocturnal  solitary  very elusive animals  and we got started getting very basic data about these animals. But what is it that a conservationist does  Well  first  we need data. We need field research. We need those long term datasets to support conservation action  and I told you tapirs are very hard to study  so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them. We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collars around their necks and follow their movements  which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world. And then we can gather information about how they use space  how they move through the landscape  what are their priority habitats  and so much more. Next  we must disseminate what we learn. We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are. And it's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. In fact  many people think this is a tapir. Let me tell you  this is not a tapir. This is a giant anteater. Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever. And then next we have to provide training  capacity building. It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future. We are losing several conservation battles  and we need more people doing what we do  and they need the skills  and they need the passion to do that. Ultimately  we conservationists  we must be able to apply our data  to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action. Our first tapir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil  one of the most threatened biomes in the world. The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early     s  when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil  beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America. This forest was almost completely cleared for timber  agriculture  cattle ranching and the construction of cities  and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing. And tapirs are found in very  very small  isolated  disconnected populations. In the Atlantic Forest  we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest. So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest  reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely. After    years in the Atlantic Forest  in       we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay. This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world  an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America. And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing because we found large  healthy tapir populations in the area  and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we'll ever find  very much free of threats. In the Pantanal  besides the GPS collars  we are using another technique  camera traps. This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it. So thanks to these amazing devices  we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies. And right now        we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado  the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil. Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country  where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats  including once again cattle ranching  large sugarcane and soybean plantations  poaching  roadkill  just to name a few. And somehow  tapirs are still there  which gives me a lot of hope. But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face. When you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be  and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them  it really breaks your heart. The situation in the Cerrado made me realize    it gave me the sense of urgency. I am swimming against the tide. It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work trying to save these animals  we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing. We have to find ways to solve all these problems. We really do  and you know what  We really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box. We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now. And I told you  roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado  so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. These are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision. Tapirs cross the highways after dark  so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway  and maybe they will slow down a little bit. For now  this is just a crazy idea. We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill. But the point is  maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done. And although I'm struggling with all these questions in my mind right now  I have a pact with tapirs. I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause. This is my passion. I am not alone. I have this huge network of supporters behind me  and there is no way I'm ever going to stop. I will continue doing this  most probably for the rest of my life. And I'll keep doing this for Patr cia  my namesake  one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest many  many years ago  for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal. And I'll keep doing this for Ted  a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal. And I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future. These animals deserve to be cared for. They need me. They need us. And you know  We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species  now and in the future. Thank you so much. I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off the shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. There is no Wi Fi involved  it's just light. And you may wonder  what's the point  And the point is this  There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide  and also to allow for what we call  The Internet of Things     tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet. In my view  such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy neutral. This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in. I demonstrated for the first time  at TED in       Li Fi  or Light Fidelity. Li Fi uses off the shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast  and also in a safe and secure manner. Data is transported by the light  encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. If we look around  we have many LEDs around us  so there's a rich infrastructure of Li Fi transmitters around us. But so far  we have been using special devices    small photo detectors  to receive the information encoded in the data. I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li Fi lights. And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels. A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED  so if the incoming light fluctuates  so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell  because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted. Of course the question is  can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness  such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights  And the answer to that is yes  we can. We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to    megabytes per second from a standard  off the shelf solar cell. And this is faster than most broadband connections these days. Now let me show you in practice. In this box is a standard  off the shelf LED lamp. This is a standard  off the shelf solar cell  it is connected to the laptop. And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. And this instrument shows something at the moment. This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light. Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light  and I'll simply  only switch on the light  for a moment  and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. So the solar cell  for a moment  is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. If I turn it off  we see it drops. I turn it on ... So we harvest energy with the solar cell. But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. And I've done this by pressing this button. So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way  and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye  because the changes are too fast to recognize. But in order to prove the point  I can block the light of the solar cell. So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. If I remove the blockage  the video will restart. And I can repeat that. So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver. But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light  and there's fog. And so I want to simulate fog  and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me. And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. First you notice the energy harvested drops  as expected  but now the video still continues. This means  despite the blockage  there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell  so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information  in this case  a high definition video. What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high speed wireless signals encoded in light  while it maintains its primary function as an energy harvesting device. That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill  or indeed  lamp post. And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows  solar cells integrated into street furniture  or indeed  solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. Because simply  we don't want to charge these devices regularly  or worse  replace the batteries every few months. As I said to you  this is the first time I've shown this in public. It's very much a lab demonstration  a prototype. But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide  and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption    because of the solar cells  quite the opposite. Thank you. Jenni Chang  When I told my parents I was gay  the first thing they said to me was   We're bringing you back to Taiwan.  In their minds  my sexual orientation was America's fault. The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas  and if only my parents had never left Taiwan  this would not have happened to their only daughter. In truth  I wondered if they were right. Of course  there are gay people in Asia  just as there are gay people in every part of the world. But is the idea of living an  out  life  in the  I'm gay  this is my spouse  and we're proud of our lives together  kind of way just a Western idea  If I had grown up in Taiwan  or any place outside of the West  would I have found models of happy  thriving LGBT people  Lisa Dazols  I had similar notions. As an HIV social worker in San Francisco  I had met many gay immigrants. They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries  just for being gay  and the reasons why they escaped to the US. I saw how this had beaten them down. After    years of doing this kind of work  I needed better stories for myself. I knew the world was far from perfect  but surely not every gay story was tragic. JC  So as a couple  we both had a need to find stories of hope. So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the  Supergays.  These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world. They would be courageous  resilient  and most of all  proud of who they were. They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be. Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film. LD  There was just one problem. We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience. We didn't even know where to find the Supergays  so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way. So we picked    countries in Asia  Africa and South America  countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights. We bought a camcorder  ordered a book on how to make a documentary    you can learn a lot these days    and set off on an around the world trip. JC  One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal. Despite widespread poverty  a decade long civil war  and now recently  a devastating earthquake  Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality. One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha. A beautiful  vibrant transgendered woman  Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation. But  in       Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination. Here's Bhumika  I'm a transgendered person. I'm so proud of my life. On December           the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same sex marriage. LD  I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis. Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations. Traveling throughout Asia  I tended to freak out women in public restrooms. They weren't used to seeing someone like me. I had to come up with a strategy  so that I could just pee in peace. So anytime I would enter a restroom  I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts  and try to be as non threatening as possible. Putting out my hands and saying   Hello   just so that people could hear my feminine voice. This all gets pretty exhausting  but it's just who I am. I can't be anything else. JC  After Nepal  we traveled to India. On one hand  India is a Hindu society  without a tradition of homophobia. On the other hand  it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system  which rejects anything that threatens the male female order. When we spoke to activists  they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality  where the women's status is established in society. And in that way  the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well. LD  There we met Prince Manvendra. He's the world's first openly gay prince. Prince Manvendra came out on the  Oprah Winfrey Show   very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family. We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly. Here he is  to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society. And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself. Whether we are gay  we are lesbian  we are transgender  bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from  we have to all unite and fight for our rights. Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms  but in the hearts and the minds of the people. JC  While getting my hair cut  the woman cutting my hair asked me   Do you have a husband   Now  this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling. When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man  she was incredulous  and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children. I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day. Now  this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner. She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country. That is  until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me. And in that ordinary afternoon  I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country. LD  From India  we traveled to East Africa  a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people. In Kenya     percent of people who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya  we met the soft spoken David Kuria. David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government. So he decided to run for senate. He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate. David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was. But we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats. because they were actually asking for me to be killed. And  yeah  there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation. JC  David wasn't ashamed of who he was. Even in the face of threats  he stayed authentic. LD  At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina. Argentina's a country where    percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Yet  Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US. In       Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the   th in the world to adopt marriage equality. There  we met Mar a Rachid. Mar a was a driving force behind that movement. Mar a Rachid  Spanish   I always say that  in reality  the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. They are for a lot of people that  even though they may never get married  will be perceived differently by their coworkers  their families and neighbors  from the national state's message of equality. I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality. And hopefully soon  the whole world will have the same rights. JC  When we made the visit to my ancestral lands  I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there. Because here is who we met  A whole community of young  beautiful Chinese LGBT people. Sure  they had their struggles. But they were fighting it out. In Shanghai  I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese. In Taipei  each time we got onto the metro  we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands. And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live. If only my parents knew. LD  By the time we finished our not so straight journey around the world  we had traveled        miles and logged     hours of video footage. We traveled to    countries and interviewed    Supergays. Turns out  it wasn't hard to find them at all. JC  Yes  there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality. And let's not forget that    countries still criminalize homosexuality today. But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world. What we ultimately took away from our journey is  equality is not a Western invention. LD  One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum  momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world  and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another. When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination  India pushed harder. When Argentina embraced marriage equality  Uruguay and Brazil followed. When Ireland said yes to equality  the world stopped to notice. When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of. JC  As we reviewed our footage  what we realized is that we were watching a love story. It wasn't a love story that was expected of me  but it is one filled with more freedom  adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined. One year after returning home from our trip  marriage equality came to California. And in the end  we believe  love will win out. by the state of California and by God Almighty  I now pronounce you spouses for life. You may kiss. So whenever I visit a school and talk to students  I always ask them the same thing  Why do you Google  Why is Google the search engine of choice for you  Strangely enough  I always get the same three answers. One   Because it works   which is a great answer  that's why I Google  too. Two  somebody will say   I really don't know of any alternatives.  It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually   Try to Google the word 'search engine ' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives.  And last but not least  thirdly  inevitably  one student will raise her or his hand and say   With Google  I'm certain to always get the best  unbiased search result.  Certain to always get the best  unbiased search result. Now  as a man of the humanities  albeit a digital humanities man  that just makes my skin curl  even if I  too  realize that that trust  that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. I will show you why that  philosophically  is almost an impossibility. But let me first elaborate  just a little bit  on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. So whenever you set out to Google something  start by asking yourself this   Am I looking for an isolated fact   What is the capital of France  What are the building blocks of a water molecule  Great    Google away. There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H  . You don't see a big conspiracy among those things. We agree  on a global scale  what the answers are to these isolated facts. But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like   Why is there an Israeli Palestine conflict   You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore  you're looking for knowledge  which is something way more complicated and delicate. And to get to knowledge  you have to bring    or    or     facts to the table and acknowledge them and say   Yes  these are all true.  But because of who I am  young or old  black or white  gay or straight  I will value them differently. And I will say   Yes  this is true  but this is more important to me than that.  And this is where it becomes interesting  because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue  to form society. And to really get somewhere  we need to filter all our facts here  through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines  to finally be grounded in real knowledge  which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve. So  I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true  clean  objective knowledge    as food for thought. I will conduct a couple of simple queries  search queries. We'll start with  Michelle Obama   the First Lady of the United States. And we'll click for pictures. It works really well  as you can see. It's a perfect search result  more or less. It's just her in the picture  not even the President. How does this work  Quite simple. Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this  but quite simply  they look at two things more than anything. First  what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website  Does it say  Michelle Obama  under the picture  Pretty good indication it's actually her on there. Second  Google looks at the picture file  the name of the file as such uploaded to the website. Again  is it called  MichelleObama.jpeg   Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture. So  you've got those two and you get a search result like this    almost. Now  in       Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign  where people set out to insult her through her search results. There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey. And that picture was published all over. And people published it very  very purposefully  to get it up there in the search results. They made sure to write  Michelle Obama  in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as  MichelleObama.jpeg   or the like. You get why    to manipulate the search result. And it worked  too. So when you picture Googled for  Michelle Obama  in       that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results. Now  the results are self cleansing  and that's sort of the beauty of it  because Google measures relevance every hour  every day. However  Google didn't settle for that this time  they just thought   That's racist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manually. We are going to write some code and fix it   which they did. And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea. Me neither. But then  a couple of years go by  and the world's most Googled Anders  Anders Behring Breivik  did what he did. This is July    in       and a terrible day in Norwegian history. This man  a terrorist  blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo  Norway and then he traveled to the island of Ut ya and shot and killed a group of kids. Almost    people died that day. And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps  that he did two things  he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids. It's not true. It was three steps. He blew up those buildings  he shot those kids  and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. And he prepared all three steps equally well. And if there was somebody who immediately understood this  it was a Swedish web developer  a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm  named Nikke Lindqvist. He's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media  on his blog and Facebook. And he told everybody   If there's something that this guy wants right now  it's to control the image of himself. Let's see if we can distort that. Let's see if we  in the civilized world  can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results.  And how  He told all of his readers the following   Go out there on the Internet  find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks    find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks    publish them in your feeds  on your websites  on your blogs. Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption  make sure to name the picture file  Breivik.jpeg.  Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist.  And it worked. Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama  this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked. If you picture Googled for him weeks after the July    events from Sweden  you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results  as a little protest. Strangely enough  Google didn't intervene this time. They did not step in and manually clean those search results up. So the million dollar question  is there anything different between these two happenings here  Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik  Of course not. It's the exact same thing  yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other. Why  Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person  that's why  and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person. See what happens there  An evaluation of a person takes place and there's only one power player in the world with the authority to say who's who.  We like you  we dislike you. We believe in you  we don't believe in you. You're right  you're wrong. You're true  you're false. You're Obama  and you're Breivik.  That's power if I ever saw it. So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person  a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate. And my message goes out not only to Google  but to all believers in the faith of code around the world. You need to identify your own personal bias. You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly. And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time when it's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again  tighter  the humanities and the technology. Tighter than ever. And  if nothing else  to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased  clean search result is  and is likely to remain  a myth. Thank you for your time. Religion is more than belief. It's power  and it's influence. And that influence affects all of us  every day  regardless of your own belief. Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today  we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society. For example  if there were a multinational organization  government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board  not one woman could have a decision making authority  not one woman could handle any financial matter  we would have outrage. There would be sanctions. And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today. We accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives  and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades. I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up. I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself. I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States. I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment  which has been dead for    years. I'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education. I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman  except in my religion. Throughout all of that time  I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion. I grew up in an enormously traditional family. I have eight siblings  a stay at home mother. My father's actually a religious leader in the community. And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life. You get married a virgin  you never drink alcohol  you don't smoke  you always do service  you're a good kid. Some of the rules we had were strict  but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed. Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore  who you dated  who you married. It determined what underwear we wore. I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated    percent of everything they earned to the church  including myself. From paper routes and babysitting  I donated    percent. I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor  having sinned. I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay. But I was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world I lived  I had friendship  instantaneous mutual aid. This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life. I had help raising my little daughter. So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead  and I accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth  which we call the priesthood. And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets  disciplinary councils  in decision making capacities  and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it. Until I stopped  and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men. And I faced this contradiction in myself  and I joined with other activists in my community. We've been working very  very  very hard for the last decade and more. The first thing we did was raise consciousness. You can't change what you can't see. We started podcasting  blogging  writing articles. I created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community. The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations. We tried to do things that were unignorable  like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all male meetings. These seem like simple things  but to us  the organizers  they were enormously costly. We lost relationships. We lost jobs. We got hate mail on a daily basis. We were attacked in social media and national press. We received death threats. We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated. Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council  and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better  because we believed that they could be. And I began to expect this reaction from my own people. I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you or criticize you. But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left  the same vehemence as the religious right. And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility  these phrases of   Oh  all religious people are crazy or stupid.   Don't pay attention to religion.   They're going to be homophobic and sexist.  What they didn't understand was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism  it bred religious extremism. Those arguments don't work  and I know because I remember someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon. And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in  because we're not stupid. So criticism and hostility doesn't work  and I didn't listen to these arguments. When I hear these arguments  I still continue to bristle  because I have family and friends. These are my people  and I'm the first to defend them  but the struggle is real. How do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others  It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer. My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade. They're intelligent people. They're lovely people. And let me try to help you understand their perspective. In Mormonism  we believe that after you die  if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals  you can be together as a family again. And to my parents  me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now  showing my shoulders  that makes me unworthy. I won't be with my family in the eternities. But even more  I had a brother die in a tragic accident at     and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family. And to my parents  they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again. And that's the mindset that we're dealing with  and criticism does not change that. And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope  explaining our sides  respecting one another  but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives  and it's been difficult. The way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear. The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right  what they all don't understand was why even care about religious activism  I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said   If you don't like religion  just leave.  Why would you try to change it  Because what is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics  our health policy  violence around the world. It leaks into education  military  fiscal decision making. These laws get legally and culturally codified. In fact  my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation. For example  during Prop    my church raised over    million dollars to fight same sex marriage in California. Forty years ago  political historians will say  that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment  we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today. How many lives did that affect  And we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules  or we can ask ourselves  why is gender inequality the default around the world  Why is that the assumption  Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality  it creates the seeds of normality. Religions can liberate or subjugate  they can empower or exploit  they can comfort or destroy  and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral are often not those in charge. Religions can't be dismissed or ignored. We need to take them seriously. But it's not easy to influence a religion  like we just talked about. But I'll tell you what my people have done. My groups are small  there's hundreds of us  but we've had huge impact. Right now  women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time. Women are now allowed to pray in our church wide meetings  and they never were before in the general conferences. As of last week  in a historic move  three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church. We've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality. We've opened up space  regardless of being despised  for more conservative women to step in and make real changes  and the words  women  and  the priesthood  can now be uttered in the same sentence. I never had that. My daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had  that's more equal    we've had an effect. It wasn't easy standing in those lines trying to get into those male meetings. There were hundreds of us  and one by one  when we got to the door  we were told   I'm sorry  this meeting is just for men   and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as    years old  escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line. But not one woman in that line will forget that day  and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day. If we were a multinational corporation or a government  and that had happened  there would be outrage  but we're just a religion. We're all just part of religions. We can't keep looking at religion that way  because it doesn't only affect me  it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have  what they can wear  who they can love and marry  if they have access to reproductive healthcare. We need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world  but we need to do it in a respectful way that breeds cooperation and not extremism. And we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery  standing up for gender equality. It's time that half of the world's population had voice and equality within our world's religions  churches  synagogues  mosques and shrines around the world. I'm working on my people. What are you doing for yours  It was April        . I was in Baghdad  covering the war in Iraq. That day  Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel  and  as happens in war  the fighting began to approach outside our windows. Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil. It smelled awful. We couldn't see a thing  but we knew what was happening. Of course  I was supposed to be writing an article  but that's how it always goes    you're supposed to be writing and something big happens. So I was in my room on the   th floor  writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening. Suddenly  there was a huge explosion. During the previous three weeks  there had been shelling with half ton missiles  but this time  the shock    I felt it inside of me  and I thought   It's very close. It's very  very close.  So I went down to see what was happening. I went down to the   th floor to take a look. And I saw people  journalists  screaming in the hallways. I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. Someone had been wounded. There was a man near the window  a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk  lying face down. Having worked in a hospital before  I wanted to help out. So I turned him over. And when I turned him over  I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis  but I couldn't see anything  nothing at all. All I saw was a white  pearly  shiny spot that blinded me  and I didn't understand what was going on. Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound  which was very serious  my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him  and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the    floors. We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. He died on the way to the hospital. The Spanish cameraman Jos  Couso  who was on the   th floor and also hit    because the shell had exploded between the two floors    died on the operating table. As soon as the car left  I went back. There was that article I was supposed to write    which I had to write. And so    I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood  when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for    days. I told him to get lost. And I said to myself   Clear your head  put it all aside. If you want to write  you need to put it all aside.  And that's what I did. I went upstairs  wrote my article and sent it off. Later  aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues  something else was bothering me. I kept seeing that shiny  pearly spot  and I couldn't understand what it meant. And then  the war was over. Later  I thought   That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened.  Because it wasn't the first time  and it didn't only happen to me. I have seen things like that happen to others in my    to    years of reporting. I have seen things that had an effect on me too. For example  there was this man I knew in Lebanon  a    year old veteran who had been fighting for five years    a real veteran    who we would follow everywhere. He would crawl in the dark with confidence    he was a great soldier  a true soldier    so we would follow him  knowing that we would be safe with him. And one day  as I was told    and I've seen him again since    he was back in the camp  playing cards  when someone came in next door  and discharged their weapon. As the gun went off  that blast  that one shot  made him duck quickly under the table  like a child. He was shaking  panicking. And since then  he has never been able to get up and fight. He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him  because he couldn't sleep  so it was quite a suitable job. So I thought to myself   What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars  How does that happen  What is this unknown thing   It was too common to be coincidental. So I started to investigate    that's all I know how to do. I started to investigate by looking through books  reaching out to psychiatrists  going to museums  libraries  etc. Finally  I discovered that some people knew about this    often military psychiatrists    and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. It was something that existed  but that we never spoke about. So  this trauma    what is it  Well  it's an encounter with death. I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death    I'm not talking about dead bodies  or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed  or someone who got hit by a car. I'm talking about facing the void of death. And that is something no one is supposed to see. People used to say   Neither the sun  nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.  A human being should not have to face the void of death. But when that happens  it can remain invisible for a while    days  weeks  months  sometimes years. And then  at some point  it explodes  because it's something that has entered your brain    a sort of window between an image and your mind    that has penetrated your brain  staying there and taking up all the space inside. And there are people    men  women  who suddenly no longer sleep. And they experience horrible anxiety attacks    panic attacks  not just minor fears. They suddenly don't want to sleep  because when they do  they have the same nightmare every night. They see the same image every night. What type of image  For example  a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him. He looks at the gun  straight down the barrel. And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous  deformed. It becomes fluffy  swallowing everything. And he says    later he will say   I saw death. I saw myself dead  therefore I'm dead.  And from then on  he knows he is dead. It is not a perception    he is convinced that he is dead. In reality  someone came in  the guy left or didn't shoot  whatever  and he didn't actually get shot    but to him  he died in that moment. Or it can be the smell of a mass grave    I saw a lot of that in Rwanda. It can be the voice of a friend calling  and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do. You hear that voice  and you wake up every night    for weeks  months    in a trance like state  anxious and terrified  like a child. I have seen men cry    just like children    from seeing the same image. So having that image of horror in your brain  seeing the void of death    that analogue of horror which is hiding something    will completely take over. You cannot do anything  anything at all. You cannot work anymore  you cannot love anymore. You go home and don't recognize anyone. You don't even recognize yourself. You hide and don't leave the house  you lock yourself in  you become ill. I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside  in case someone tried to get in. All of a sudden  you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away. You want to be loved  but you hate everyone. It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out  and you suffer tremendously. And no one understands. They say   There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine  you have no injuries. You went to war  came back  you're fine.  These people suffer tremendously. Some commit suicide. After all  suicide is like updating your daily planner    I'm already dead  I might as well commit suicide. Plus  there is no more pain. Some commit suicide  others end up under the bridge  drinking. Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink  never said a word  always in a bad mood  beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying. And why do we not talk about this  We don't talk about it because it's taboo. It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. But others don't want hear it. The first time I returned from an assignment  They said   Oh  He's back.  There was a fancy dinner    white tablecloth  candles  guests.  Tell us everything   Which I did. After    minutes  people were giving me dirty looks  the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. So I don't talk about it anymore. We're just not ready to listen. People say outright   Please  stop.  Is that a rare occurrence  No  it's extremely common. One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq    well  not  died   let me re phrase that    one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. In       there were still         soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals. In Vietnam         people died    Americans. In       the US government identified            twice as many            veterans who died from committing suicide. Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam. So you see  this relates to everything  not just modern warfare  but also ancient wars    you can read about it  the evidence is there. So why do we not talk about it  Why have we not talked about it  The problem is that if you don't talk about it  you're heading for disaster. The only way to heal    and the good news here is that this is treatable    think Munch's The Scream  Goya  etc.    it's indeed treatable. The only way to heal from this trauma  from this encounter with death that overwhelms  petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it. People used to say   Language is the only thing that holds all of us together.  Without language  we're nothing. It's the thing that makes us human. In the face of such a horrible image    a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us    the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it. Because these people feel excluded from humanity. No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone. They feel dirty  defiled  ashamed. Someone said   Doctor  I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes.  Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists  going from doctor to doctor. And then one day  they sent him to a psychiatrist. During his second session  he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe. The psychiatrist asked   Why are you in this state   And the man said   Well  because I'm dead  so I must be rotting away.  So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. In order to heal  we need to talk about it. The horror needs to be put into words    human words  so we can organize it and talk about it again. We have to look death in the face. And if we can do that  if we can talk about these things  then step by step  by working it out verbally  we can reclaim our place in humanity. And it is important. Silence kills us. So what does this mean  It means that after a trauma  without question  we lose our  unbearable lightness of being   that sense of immortality that keeps us here    meaning  if we're here  we almost feel like we're immortal  which we're not  but if we didn't believe that  we'd say   What's the point of it all   But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality. They've lost their lightness. But they have found something else. So this means that if we manage to look death in the face  and actually confront it  rather than keep quiet and hide  like some of the men or women I know did  such as Michael from Rwanda  Carole from Iraq  Philippe from the Congo and other people I know  like Sorj Chalandon  now a great writer  who gave up field assignments after a trauma. Five friends of mine committed suicide  they're the ones who did not survive the trauma. So if we can look death in the face  if we  mortal humans  human mortals  understand that we are human and mortal  mortal and human  if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places  since no one has ever seen it    if we can give it back this meaning  yes  we may die  survive and come back to life  but we'll come back stronger than before. Much stronger. Thank you. This is the Air Jordan   Black Cement. This might be the most important sneaker in history. First released in       this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage  and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan   Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement. It's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now  most of you are probably thinking   Sneakers   Yes. Yes  sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related  possibly  to the future of all online commerce. In       the last time the Jordan   Black Cement was released  at a retail of     dollars  it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that  thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. In fact  there's over       pairs on eBay right now  four years later. But here's the thing  this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another release or two or three  and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the Jordan   Black Cement. This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads    people who collect sneakers    and my daughter. That's an  I love Dad  T shirt. For the brands  sneakerheads are a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers  these are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of        Back to the Future sneakers  Yeah        dollars. And while that's obviously the anomaly  the resell sneaker market is definitely not. Thirty years in the making  what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much    Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past    months  there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone  at a value of  .  billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate    I should know  I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections  mine doesn't even register. I have about     pairs  but trust me  I am small time. People have thousands. I'm a very typical    year old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played  I always wanted Air Jordans  my mother would never buy me Air Jordans  as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans    literally  we all have the exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies  I took a job as a strategy consultant  when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned  because I had to  and I liked it. So I thought  I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data  just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide  a real data driven view of the market. And four years later  we're analyzing over    million transactions  providing real time analytics on thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases. Others have used the data to validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry. And here's the best part  sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios. Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time  compare it to others  and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which     are his. He can see it's worth         dollars    frankly  a modest collection. At the asset level  he can see gain loss by shoe. Here he's made over     dollars on one pair. I have one of those. So an unregulated  .  billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online  and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers  At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market  and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs  In fact  one guy emailed to say he thought his    year old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers. And now they use the data to do it together. And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids  You have to be    to play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade  Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school. The cards are long dead  and the candy market's usually quite local. For a lot of people  sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity    a democratized stock market  but also unregulated. Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely happens and is tragic  it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe. In fact  it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story. So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade  but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers  that someone is Nike. Let me walk you through some numbers. The resell market  we know  is   .  billion. Nike  including Jordan brand  accounts for    percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market is about a third. That means that sneakerheads made     million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers  earlier this year  became the number two footwear brand in the country  surpassing Adidas    this was a big deal. And in the    months ending in June  Skechers's net income was     million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor. That    How is that even possible  The sneaker market is just supply and demand  but Nike's gotten very good at using supply    limited sneakers    and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike  they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for       dollars do so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other collectible market  only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike    ingeniously created by Nike  in the most positive sense    to sell more shoes. And in the process  it provided tens of thousands of people with life long passions  myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market  they could do so tomorrow  all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to  nor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple  who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one  Nike doesn't make their money by just selling      sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for    dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet  and enable Nike to sell millions of     sneakers. It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before    this isn't in any textbook. For    years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market  with a Facebook level hyped IPO every single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at  am on a Saturday morning  and there will be a line down the street and around the block  and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year  Nike lines happen     times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling supply and distribution. But once a pair leaves the retail channel  it's the Wild West. There are very few    if any    legal  unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely not the stock exchange. In fact  there is no central exchange. By last count  there were    different online markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones  some are mobile markets  and then you have consignment shops and brick and mortar stores  and sneaker conventions  and reseller sites  and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter    literally  anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other  shoes will be bought and sold. But that means no efficiencies  no transparency  sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's how stocks were bought  What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock was to search over     places online and off  including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock  Never knowing who had the best price  or even if the stock you were looking at was real. That would surely make you say   WTF   Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either  What if the inverse is true  and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock  And what if it wasn't just sneakers  but any similar product  like watches and handbags and women's shoes  and any collectible  any seasonal item and any markdown item  What if there was a stock market for commerce  A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner  but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well  maybe you see where this is going. Maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan   Black Cement in       you could either be wearing them onstage  or have earned     percent on your money    double the S P and    percent more than Apple. And that's why we're talking about sneakers. Thank you. What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind  My whole life as a journalist  I've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care. I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary. I've worked in broadcast. But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality that I started seeing these really intense  authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind. So the deal is that with VR  virtual reality  I can put you on scene in the middle of the story. By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look  you get this whole body sensation  like you're actually  like  there. So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together. And I wanted to do a piece about hunger. Families in America are going hungry  food banks are overwhelmed  and they're often running out of food. Now  I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry  but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical. So    again  this is five years ago    so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a worse than half baked idea  and I had no funding. Believe me  I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me. And I did  though  have a really great intern  a woman named Michaela Kobsa Mark. And together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs. Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling  she was just crying. She had been on scene at a long line  where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed  and she was screaming   There's too many people  There's too many people   And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time  his blood sugar drops too low  and he collapses into a coma. As soon as I heard that audio  I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks. So here's the real line. You can see how long it was  right  And again  as I said  we didn't have very much funding  so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated  and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could. And then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible. Voice  OK  he's having a seizure. Voice  We need an ambulance. Nonny de la Pe a  So the man on the right  for him  he's walking around the body. For him  he's in the room with that body. Like  that guy is at his feet. And even though  through his peripheral vision  he can see that he's in this lab space  he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street  but he feels like he's there with those people. He's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn't really there  right  So that piece ended up going to Sundance in       a kind of amazing thing  and it was the first virtual reality film ever  basically. And when we went  I was really terrified. I didn't really know how people were going to react and what was going to happen. And we showed up with this duct taped pair of goggles. So you can hear the surprise in my voice  right  And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over  people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim  trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help  even though they couldn't. And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying   Oh my God  I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy   and take that back into their lives. So after this piece was made  the dean of the cinema school at USC  the University of Southern California  brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try  Hunger   and he took off the goggles  and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot. And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids  because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war. I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps  basically an area I wouldn't send a team now  as that's where ISIS is really operating. And then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off. Now  when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds  and you see the injured around you  it's an incredibly scary and real feeling. I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear.  The civil war in Syria may seem far away   until you experience it yourself.   Project Syria   A virtual reality experience  NP  We were then invited to take the piece to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. And it wasn't advertised. And we were put in this tapestry room. There was no press about it  so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights. You know  maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries. They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras. But a lot of people tried it  and over a five day run we ended up with    pages of guest book comments  and we were told by the curators there that they'd never seen such an outpouring. Things like   It's so real    Absolutely believable   or  of course  the one that I was excited about   A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the TV news.  So  it works  right  This stuff works. And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are    it's really evocative. Now  don't get me wrong    I'm not saying that when you're in a piece you forget that you're here. But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once. We can have what I call this duality of presence  and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy. Right  So that means  of course  that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces. I have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity. If we don't capture the material ourselves  we have to be extremely exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic  Let me give you an example. With this Trayvon Martin case  this is a guy  a kid  who was    years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store  and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him. To make that piece  we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex  and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out  based on those drawings. All of the action is informed by the real     recorded calls to the police. And interestingly  we broke some news with this story. The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction  Primeau Productions  they say that they would testify that George Zimmerman  when he got out of the car  he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin. So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism  they don't really change here  right  We're still following the same principles that we would always. What is different is the sense of being on scene  whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene. And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces  and thinking about how to make them. We're trying to make this  obviously  beyond the headset  more available. We're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece. And these things have had impact. I've had Americans tell me that they've donated  direct deductions from their bank account  money to go to Syrian children refugees. And  Hunger in LA   well  it's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country. It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge. I think each one is about the size of California. Tell us about Kiribati. Anote Tong  Well  let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much. But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands  the Gilbert Group on the west  we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle  and the Line Islands in the east. And quite frankly  Kiribati is perhaps the only country that is actually in the four corners of the world  because we are in the Northern Hemisphere  in the Southern Hemisphere  and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line. These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls  and on average about two meters above sea level. And so this is what we have. Usually not more than two kilometers in width. And so  on many occasions  I've been asked by people   You know  you're suffering  why don't you move back   They don't understand. They have no concept of what it is that's involved. With the rising sea  they say   Well  you can move back.  And so this is what I tell them. If we move back  we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK  But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand. CA  So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country  AT  Well  the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades. And when I came into office in       I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly  but not with so much passion  because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human induced  whether it was real or it wasn't. But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in      with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC  which made a categorical statement that it is real  it's human induced  and it's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine. And so that's when I got very serious. In the past  I talked about it. We were worried. But when the scenarios  the predictions came in       it became a real issue for us. CA  Now  those predictions are  I think  that by       sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet. There's scenarios where it's higher than that  for sure  but what would you say to a skeptic who said   What's three feet  You're on average six feet above sea level. What's the problem   AT  Well  I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land  because much of the land is low. And quite apart from that  we are getting the swells at the moment. So it's not about getting two feet. I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future. Well  we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. It's already with us. We have communities who already have been dislocated. They have had to move  and every parliament session  I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls  to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed  and so in my trips to the different islands  I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops  the contamination of the water lenses  and I see these communities perhaps leaving  having to relocate  within five to    years. CA  And then  I think the country suffered its first cyclone  and this is connected  yes  What happened here  AT  Well  we're on the equator  and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator  it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones. We create them  and then we send them either north or south. But they aren't supposed to come back. But for the first time  at the beginning of this year  the Cyclone Pam  which destroyed Vanuatu  and in the process  the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands  and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck. But for our two southernmost islands  we had waves come over half the island  and so this has never happened before. It's a new experience. And I've just come back from my own constituency  and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades  they've been totally destroyed. So this is what's happening  but when we talk about the rising sea level  we think it's something that happens gradually. It comes with the winds  it comes with the swells  and so they can be magnified  but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern  which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level. CA  So the country is already seeing effects now. As you look forward  what are your options as a country  as a nation  AT  Well  I've been telling this story every year. I think I visit a number of    I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand. We have a plan  we think we have a plan. And on one occasion  I think I spoke in Geneva and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me on something like this  and I said   We are looking at floating islands   and he thought it was funny  but somebody said   No  this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions.  And so I have been looking at floating islands. The Japanese are interested in building floating islands. But  as a country  we have made a commitment that no matter what happens  we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation. What that will take  it's going to be something quite significant  very  very substantial. Either we live on floating islands  or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe. But even that  it's going to be very  very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need. CA  And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration. AT  Well  we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community  we are preparing  we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe. OK  We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time. We want to be able to give the people the choice today  those who choose and want to do that  to migrate. We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so. Of course  our culture is very different  our society is very different  and once we migrate into a different environment  a different culture  there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required. CA  Well  there's forced migration in your country's past  and I think just this week  just yesterday or the day before yesterday  you visited these people. What happened here  What's the story here  AT  Yes  and I'm sorry  I think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place. I had a very good reason  because we have a community of Kiribati people living in that part of the Solomon Islands  but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands  in fact  in the     s. There was serious drought  and the people could not continue to live on the island  and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands. And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people. They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me. Some of them later recognized me  but I think they were very happy. Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally. But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting because here I see our people. I spoke in our language  and of course they spoke back  they replied  but their accent  they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly. I saw them  there was this lady with red teeth. She was chewing betel nuts  and it's not something we do in Kiribati. We don't chew betel nuts. I met also a family who have married the local people here  and so this is what is happening. As you go into another community  there are bound to be changes. There is bound to be a certain loss of identity  and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate. CA  It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity  the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost. And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location. AT  This is our wish. Nobody wants ever to leave their home  and so it's been a very difficult decision for me. As a leader  you don't make plans to leave your island  your home  and so I've been asked on a number of occasions   So how do you feel   And it doesn't feel good at all. It's an emotional thing  and I've tried to live with it  and I know that on occasions  I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem because I can't solve the problem. It's something that's got to be done collectively. Climate change is a global phenomenon  and as I've often argued  unfortunately  the countries  when we come to the United Nations    I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries where Australia and New Zealand are also members  and we had an argument. There was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions  it would be something that they're unable to do because it would affect the industries. And so here I was saying  OK  I hear you  I understand what you're saying  but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions  then our survival is on the line. And so it's a matter for you to weigh this  these moral issues. It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people. CA  You know  I ask you yesterday what made you angry  and you said   I don't get angry.  But then you paused. I think this made you angry. AT  I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations. I was very angry  very frustrated and then depressed. There was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning. I had to change my approach. I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational  but I remain radically rational  whatever that is. CA  Now  a core part of your nation's identity is fishing. I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way. AT  Well  we eat fish every day  every day  and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world. We don't have a lot of livestock  so it's fish that we depend on. CA  So you're dependent on fish  both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna  and yet despite that  a few years ago you took a very radical step. Can you tell us about that  I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands. AT  Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us. We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. In the Pacific  I think we own something like    percent of the remaining tuna fisheries  and it remains relatively healthy for some species  but not all. And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners  tuna resource owners. And at the moment  we have been getting something like    to    percent of our revenue from access fees  license fees. CA  Of your national revenue. AT  National revenue  which drives everything that we do in governments  hospitals  schools and what have you. But we decided to close this  and it was a very difficult decision. I can assure you  politically  locally  it was not easy  but I was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable. There had been some indications that some of the species  in particular the bigeye  was under serious threat. The yellowfin was also heavily fished. Skipjack remains healthy. And so we had to do something like that  and so that was the reason I did that. Another reason why I did that was because I had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change  in order to fight climate change  there has got to be sacrifice  there has got to be commitment. So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice  I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice. And so we made the sacrifice. And forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue. We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year  and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue. CA  So there's so many things playing into this. On the one hand  it may prompt healthier fisheries. I mean  how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas  AT  The negotiations have been very difficult  but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day. For any vessel to come in to fish for a day  we have raised the fee from    it was        and         now to                  per vessel day. And so there's been that significant increase. But at the same time  what's important to note is  whereas in the past these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch    tons  now they're catching maybe     tons because they've become so efficient. And so we've got to respond likewise. We've got to be very  very careful because the technology has so improved. There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They couldn't. They started experimenting if they could  per se. But now they've got ways of doing it  and they've become so efficient. CA  Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations  Because you're up against companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake  essentially. How do you hold the line  Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country  get the most for the fish  What advice would you give  AT  Well  I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return  because what we are getting from license fees is about    percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf  not in the retail shops. And we only get about    percent. What we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry  in the harvesting  in the processing  and eventually  hopefully  the marketing. They're not easy to penetrate  but we are working towards that  and yes  the answer would be to enhance. In order to increase our rate of return  we have to become more involved. And so we've started doing that  and we have to restructure the industry. We've got to tell these people that the world has changed. Now we want to produce the fish ourselves. CA  And meanwhile  for your local fishermen  they are still able to fish  but what is business like for them  Is it getting harder  Are the waters depleted  Or is that being run on a sustainable basis  AT  For the artisanal fishery  we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except only to supply the domestic market. The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market  mostly here in the US  Europe  Japan. So I am a fisherman  very much  and I used to be able to catch yellowfin. Now it's very  very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners. CA  So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country. I mean  as you think about their future  what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world  AT  Well  I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us  it's about the future of these children. I have    grandchildren  at least. I think I have     my wife knows. And I think I have eight children. It's about their future. Every day I see my grandchildren  about the same age as these young girls  and I do wonder  and I get angry sometimes  yes I do. I wonder what is to become of them. And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody  that it's not about their own national interest  because climate change  regrettably  unfortunately  is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not. And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners  the Australians and New Zealanders  because they said   We can't cut any more.  This is what one of the leaders  the Australian leader  said  that we've done our part  we are cutting back. I said  What about the rest  Why don't you keep it  If you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries  within your borders  we'd have no question. You can go ahead as much as you like. But unfortunately  you're sending it our way  and it's affecting the future of our children. And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today. We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year  but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon  because we create it  individually  as nations  but it affects everybody else  and yet  we refuse to do anything about it  and we deal with it as a national problem  which it is not    it is a global issue  and it's got to be dealt with collectively. CA  People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers  and we shut our minds to it. Somehow  to people  we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes. And it seems like it's very possible that your nation  despite  actually because of the intense problems you face  you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly  most powerfully. I just want to thank you   I'm sure  on behalf of all of us  for your extraordinary leadership and for being here. Mr. President  thank you so much. AT  Thank you. Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel  Let's start with a question  Does my dog really love me  or does she just want a treat  Well  it's easy to see that our dog really loves us  easy to see  right  what's going on in that fuzzy little head. What is going on  Something's going on. But why is the question always do they love us  Why is it always about us  Why are we such narcissists  I found a different question to ask animals. Who are you  There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. But is that true  What are other beings doing with those brains  What are they thinking and feeling  Is there a way to know  I think there is a way in. I think there are several ways in. We can look at evolution  we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do. The first thing to remember is  our brain is inherited. The first neurons came from jellyfish. Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates. The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates. The vertebrates came out of the sea  and here we are. But it's still true that a neuron  a nerve cell  looks the same in a crayfish  a bird or you. What does that say about the minds of crayfish  Can we tell anything about that  Well  it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow  it will develop anxiety. If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans  it relaxes and comes out and explores. How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety  Mostly  we boil them. Octopuses use tools  as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces. How do we celebrate the ape like intelligence of this invertebrate  Mostly boiled. If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral  it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray   Follow me   and the moray will understand that signal. The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish  but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it. This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about. How do we celebrate that ancient partnership  Mostly fried. A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them. Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do  which is called teaching. Chimpanzees don't teach. Killer whales teach and killer whales share food. When evolution makes something new  it uses the parts it has in stock  off the shelf  before it fabricates a new twist. And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time. If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain  what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain. It's a good thing ours is bigger  because we're also really insecure. But  uh oh  there's a dolphin  a bigger brain with more convolutions. OK  maybe you're saying  all right  well  we see brains  but what does that have to say about minds  Well  we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors. So these elephants  you can see  obviously  they are resting. They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep  while they doze but remain vigilant. We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains  listening to the howls of the same dangers  they became who they are and we became who we are. We've been neighbors for a very long time. No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed. They're obviously very concerned about something. What are they concerned about  It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes  elephants will ignore it  because tourists never bother elephants. But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes  the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker. Not only do elephants know that there are humans  they know that there are different kinds of humans  and that some are OK and some are dangerous. They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them. They know us better than we know them. We have the same imperatives  take care of our babies  find food  try to stay alive. Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea  we are basically the same. We are kin under the skin. The elephant has the same skeleton  the killer whale has the same skeleton  as do we. We see helping where help is needed. We see curiosity in the young. We see the bonds of family connections. We recognize affection. Courtship is courtship. And then we ask   Are they conscious   When you get general anesthesia  it makes you unconscious  which means you have no sensation of anything. Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something. If you see  if you hear  if you feel  if you're aware of anything  you are conscious  and they are conscious. Some people say well  there are certain things that make humans humans  and one of those things is empathy. Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions. It's a very useful thing. If your companions start to move quickly  you have to feel like you need to hurry up. We're all in a hurry now. The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. If your companions suddenly startle and fly away  it does not work very well for you to say   Jeez  I wonder why everybody just left.  Empathy is old  but empathy  like everything else in life  comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration. So there's basic empathy  you feel sad  it makes me sad. I see you happy  it makes me happy. Then there's something that I call sympathy  a little more removed   I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away. I don't feel that same grief  but I get it  I know what you feel and it concerns me.  And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy  I call that compassion. Far from being the thing that makes us human  human empathy is far from perfect. We round up empathic creatures  we kill them and we eat them. Now  maybe you say OK  well  those are different species. That's just predation  and humans are predators. But we don't treat our own kind too well either. People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species. Well  I think that's silly  because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling  because their brains are basically the same as ours. They have the same structures. The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well. It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out  and then say when they're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy  we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything. That is not scientific. So OK  so a reporter said to me   Maybe  but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel   And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me. When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me    not to the couch  to me    and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly  she has had the thought   I would like my belly rubbed. I know that I can go over to Carl  he will understand what I'm asking. I know I can trust him because we're family. He'll get the job done  and it will feel good.  She has thought and she has felt  and it's really not more complicated than that. But we see other animals and we say   Oh look  killer whales  wolves  elephants  that's not how they see it.  That tall finned male is L  . He's    years old. The female right on his left side is L  . She's   . They've known each other for decades. They know exactly who they are. They know who their friends are. They know who their rivals are. Their life follows the arc of a career. They know where they are all the time. This is an elephant named Philo. He was a young male. This is him four days later. Humans not only can feel grief  we create an awful lot of it. We want to carve their teeth. Why can't we wait for them to die  Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. In       there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa. And now their range is shattered into little shards. This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction  a fellow being  the most magnificent creature on land. Of course  we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States. In Yellowstone National Park  we killed every single wolf. We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border  actually. But in the park  park rangers did that in the     s  and then    years later they had to bring them back  because the elk numbers had gotten out of control. And then people came. People came by the thousands to see the wolves  the most accessibly visible wolves in the world. And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves. A pack is a family. It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations. And I watched the most famous  most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park. And then  when they wandered just outside the border  two of their adults were killed  including the mother  which we sometimes call the alpha female. The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry. Sisters kicked out other sisters. That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family. They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her. She was getting too much attention from two new males  and she was the precocious one. That was too much for them. She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot. The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family. As winter was coming in  he lost his territory  his hunting support  the members of his family and his mate. We cause so much pain to them. The mystery is  why don't they hurt us more than they do  This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale. Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear. This whale is T  . He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions. The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat. They had nothing to fear. They eat seals. Why don't they eat us  Why can we trust them around our toddlers  Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline  And that's happened more than one time. In the Bahamas  there's a woman named Denise Herzing  and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her. She knows them very well. She knows who they all are. They know her. They recognize the research boat. When she shows up  it's a big happy reunion. Except  one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat  and that was really strange. And they couldn't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk. How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped  Why would they care  And why would it spook them  These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all. At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle nosed dolphin named Dolly. She was nursing  and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool  smoking. Dolly came over and looked at him  went back to her mother  nursed for a minute or two  came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke. Somehow  this baby bottle nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke. When human beings use one thing to represent another  we call that art. The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human. What makes us human is that  of all these things that our minds and their minds have  we are the most extreme. We are the most compassionate  most violent  most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet  and we are all of those things all jumbled up together. But love is not the thing that makes us human. It's not special to us. We are not the only ones who care about our mates. We are not the only ones who care about our children. Albatrosses frequently fly six  sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal  one big meal  to their chick who is waiting for them. They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world  and this is what it looks like. Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being. If that stops  it all goes away. If anything is sacred  that is  and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash. All of these birds have plastic in them now. This is an albatross six months old  ready to fledge    died  packed with red cigarette lighters. This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world. But we  who have named ourselves after our brains  never think about the consequences. When we welcome new human life into the world  we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures. We paint animals on the walls. We don't paint cell phones. We don't paint work cubicles. We paint animals to show them that we are not alone. We have company. And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark  deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now  and their flood is us. So we started with a question  Do they love us  We're going to ask another question. Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue  Thank you very much. There's something about caves    a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in. As you pass through the portal between light and dark  you enter a subterranean world    a place of perpetual gloom  of earthy smells  of hushed silence. Long ago in Europe  ancient people also entered these underground worlds. As witness to their passage  they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings  like this panel of humans  triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guare a in Spain. You now walk the same path as these early artists. And in this surreal  otherworldly place  it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth  or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend. When I'm in a cave  I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark  In this video clip  that was shot half a kilometer  or about a third of a mile  underground  in the cave of Cudon in Spain  we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave. As we crawled forward  military style  with the ceiling getting ever lower  we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer  Dylan  could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera. So while he filmed me  I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point and shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground. Seriously. What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp  I mean    me  it makes sense  right  But you know  this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research. I study some of the oldest art in the world. It was created by these early artists in Europe  between        and        years ago. And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful  though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind  of the evolution of creativity  of imagination  of abstract thought  about what it means to be human. While all species communicate in one way or another  only we humans have really taken it to another level. Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story. Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible  in large part  by our ability to communicate    in particular  using graphic or written forms of communication. The thing is  though  that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed. It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on. They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time  what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication. There are three main types of communication  spoken  gestural    so things like sign language    and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral. It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received. And after the moment of transmission  it's gone forever. Graphic communication  on the other hand  decouples that relationship. And with its invention  it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time. Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves  rock shelters and even a few surviving open air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today. This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets  three to four kilometers high  with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age. Over the last century  more than     Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent  decorated with animals  abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists. Since their discovery  it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain  or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega. But for me  it was the abstract shapes  what we call geometric signs  that drew me to study the art. The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images. But when I started on this back in       there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were  nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time. Before I could even get started on my questions  my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites  usually the ones with the very nice animals  there was also a large number of them where it was very vague    there wasn't a lot of description or detail. Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more. These were the ones that I targeted for my field work. Over the course of two years  my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over     hours underground  hiking  crawling and wriggling around    sites in France  Spain  Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it. We found new  undocumented geometric signs at    percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions. So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers  there are only    geometric signs. Only    signs across a        year time span and the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number. Now  if these were random doodles or decorations  we would expect to see a lot more variation  but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong  before losing popularity and vanishing  while other signs are later inventions. But    percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period    things like lines  rectangles triangles  ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age  at a        year old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers  other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns  with some being limited to a single territory  like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain  and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs. On a side note  there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signs appearing in such far flung places  especially in that        to        year range  it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa. But that I'm afraid  is a subject for a future talk. So back to the matter at hand. There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators  like these        year old bas relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant  but the people of the time certainly did. The repetition of the same signs  for so long  and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes  with specific  culturally recognized  agreed upon meanings  than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world. I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language  something which is a requirement for a full writing system. Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet. But what we do have are some intriguing one offs  like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain  known as  The Inscription   with its symmetrical markings on the left  possible stylized representations of hands in the middle  and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right. The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world    Sumerian cuneiform  Egyptian hieroglyphs  the earliest Chinese script  all emerged between       and       years ago  with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations  where the meaning and the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal. It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized  until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language    things like pronouns  adverbs  adjectives. So knowing all this  it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead  what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks  maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily  as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them. Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing  Or what about celestial objects like star constellations  Or maybe even rivers  mountains  trees    landscape features  possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain. The term penniform means  feather shaped  in Latin  but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree  Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites  but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this  of course  is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category  I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off. Now don't get me wrong  the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum. And that even       years ago  people were already building on something much older  with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years    to the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond  to that point  deep in our collective history  when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark  and forever changed the nature of how we communicate. Thank you. It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves. What do my bookshelves say about me  Well  when I asked myself this question a few years ago  I made an alarming discovery. I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured  cosmopolitan sort of person. But my bookshelves told a rather different story. Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors  and there was almost nothing in translation. Discovering this massive  cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock. And when I thought about it  it seemed like a real shame. I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English. And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them. So  I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading.      was set to be a very international year for the UK  it was the year of the London Olympics. And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel  short story collection or memoir from every country in the world. And so I did. And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today. But it started with some practical problems. After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project  I ended up going with the list of UN recognized nations  to which I added Taiwan  which gave me a total of     countries. And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about  roughly  four books a week around working five days a week  I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country. Only around  .  percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations  and the figures are similar for much of the English speaking world. Although  the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher.  .  percent is tiny enough to start with  but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English language publishers. So  for example  although well over     books are translated from French and published in the UK each year  most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. French speaking Africa  on the other hand  will rarely ever get a look in. The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English. Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language. But when it came to reading the world  the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start. Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books  I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world. I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland. I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia. There was no hiding it    I was a clueless literary xenophobe. So how on earth was I going to read the world  I was going to have to ask for help. So in October       I registered my blog  ayearofreadingtheworld.com  and I posted a short appeal online. I explained who I was  how narrow my reading had been  and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet. Now  I had no idea whether anyone would be interested  but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online  people started to get in touch. At first  it was friends and colleagues. Then it was friends of friends. And pretty soon  it was strangers. Four days after I put that appeal online  I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur. She said she loved the sound of my project  could she go to her local English language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me  I accepted enthusiastically  and a few weeks later  a package arrived containing not one  but two books    Rafidah's choice from Malaysia  and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. Now  at the time  I was amazed that a stranger more than       miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet. But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year. Time and again  people went out of their way to help me. Some took on research on my behalf  and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me. It turns out  if you want to read the world  if you want to encounter it with an open mind  the world will help you. When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English  people went further still. Books often came from surprising sources. My Panamanian read  for example  came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter. Yes  the Panama Canal has a Twitter account. And when I tweeted at it about my project  it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan. I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message  asking if any of his Spanish language novels had been translated into English. And he said that nothing had been published  but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel  The Golden Horse.  He emailed this to me  allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English. Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way. From Sweden to Palau  writers and translators sent me self published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available  giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds. I read  for example  about the Southern African king Ngungunhane  who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the   th century  and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan. I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones. And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola. But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world  came towards the end of my quest  when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny  Portuguese speaking African island nation of S o Tom  and Pr ncipe. Now  having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation  it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch. Now  I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this  and give up their time for something like that. But  within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers  I had more people than I could involve in the project  including Margaret Jull Costa  a leader in her field  who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner Jos  Saramago. With my nine volunteers in place  I managed to find a book by a S o Tom an author that I could buy enough copies of online. Here's one of them. And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection  stuck to their word  sent their translations back to me  and within six weeks  I had the entire book to read. In that case  as I found so often during my year of reading the world  my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity. When it came to S o Tom  and Pr ncipe  it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories  but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor. My weakness had become the project's strength. The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things. As those who enjoy reading will know  books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset  so that  for a while at least  you look at the world through different eyes. That can be an uncomfortable experience  particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. But it can also be really enlightening. Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world. When I looked back at much of the English language literature I'd grown up with  for example  I began to see how narrow a lot of it was  compared to the richness that the world has to offer. And as the pages turned  something else started to happen  too. Little by little  that long list of countries that I'd started the year with  changed from a rather dry  academic register of place names into living  breathing entities. Now  I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. But cumulatively  the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness  diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet. It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me. These days  when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e reader  they tell a rather different story. It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political  geographical  cultural  social  religious divides. It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together. And  it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in  where  thanks to the Internet  it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story  a worldview  a book with someone she may never meet  on the other side of the planet. I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. And I hope many more people will join me. If we all read more widely  there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books  and we would all be richer for that. Thank you. Your company launches a search for an open position. The applications start rolling in  and the qualified candidates are identified. Now the choosing begins. Person A  Ivy League   .   flawless resume  great recommendations. All the right stuff. Person B  state school  fair amount of job hopping  and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress. But remember    both are qualified. So I ask you  who are you going to pick  My colleagues and I created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates. We call A  the Silver Spoon   the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success. And we call B  the Scrapper   the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point. You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers    which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. But before my human resources certification gets revoked    let me explain. A resume tells a story. And over the years  I've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt  that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away. A series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency  lack of focus  unpredictability. Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles. At the very least  the Scrapper deserves an interview. To be clear  I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon  getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. But if your whole life has been engineered toward success  how will you handle the tough times  One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university  there were certain assignments that were beneath him  like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation. Eventually  he quit. But on the flip side  what happens when your whole life is destined for failure and you actually succeed  I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper. I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper. Before I was born  my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia  and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance. Our lives were one part  Cuckoo's Nest   one part  Awakenings  and one part  A Beautiful Mind.  I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn  New York. We never owned a home  a car  a washing machine  and for most of my childhood  we didn't even have a telephone. So I was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers  because my life could easily have turned out very differently. As I met successful business people and read profiles of high powered leaders  I noticed some commonality. Many of them had experienced early hardships  anywhere from poverty  abandonment  death of a parent while young  to learning disabilities  alcoholism and violence. The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress  and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction. But during studies of dysfunction  data revealed an unexpected insight  that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation. A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered  which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth. In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk  among a subset of     children who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions  fully one third grew up to lead healthy  successful and productive lives. In spite of everything and against tremendous odds  they succeeded. One third. Take this resume. This guy's parents give him up for adoption. He never finishes college. He job hops quite a bit  goes on a sojourn to India for a year  and to top it off  he has dyslexia. Would you hire this guy  His name is Steve Jobs. In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs  it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia. In the US     percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia. What's remarkable    among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth  they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail. They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity  they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they've become  and know that without those experiences  they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful. One of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in     . At age     his parents were relocated to the countryside  the schools were closed and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until     when he got a job in a clothing factory. But instead of accepting his fate  he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education. Eleven years later  when the political landscape changed  he heard about a highly selective university admissions test. He had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school. So  every day he came home from the factory  took a nap  studied until  am  went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months. He did it  he succeeded. His commitment to his education was unwavering  and he never lost hope. Today  he holds a master's degree  and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard. Scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself. When things don't turn out well  Scrappers ask   What can I do differently to create a better result   Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves  kind of like if you've survived poverty  a crazy father and several muggings  you figure   Business challenges     Really  Piece of cake. I got this.  And that reminds me    humor. Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times  and laughter helps you change your perspective. And finally  there are relationships. People who overcome adversity don't do it alone. Somewhere along the way  they find people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success. Having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity. I was lucky. In my first job after college  I didn't have a car  so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president's assistant. She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past. Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally honest feedback  advice and mentorship. These people don't mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college. I'll leave you with one final  valuable insight. Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers. According to DiversityInc  a study of their top    companies for diversity outperformed the S P     by    percent. So back to my original question. Who are you going to bet on  Silver Spoon or Scrapper  I say choose the underestimated contender  whose secret weapons are passion and purpose. Hire the Scrapper. Now... let's go back in time. It's     . There is the gallery somewhere in the world  and there is a young girl  age     standing in the middle of the space. In the front of her is a table. On the table there are    objects for pleasure and for pain. Some of the objects are a glass of water  a coat  a shoe  a rose. But also the knife  the razor blade  the hammer and the pistol with one bullet. There are instructions which say   I'm an object. You can use everything on the table on me. I'm taking all responsibility    even killing me. And the time is six hours.  The beginning of this performance was easy. People would give me the glass of water to drink  they'd give me the rose. But very soon after  there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes  and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach. Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood  and I still have the scar. The women would tell the men what to do. And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening  and it was all public  and they were with their wives. They carried me around and put me on the table  and put the knife between my legs. And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple. And another person took the pistol and they started a fight. And after six hours were finished  I... started walking towards the public. I was a mess. I was half naked  I was full of blood and tears were running down my face. And everybody escaped  they just ran away. They could not confront myself  with myself as a normal human being. And then    what happened is I went to the hotel  it was at two in the morning. And I looked at myself in the mirror  and I had a piece of gray hair. Alright    please take off your blindfolds. Welcome to the performance world. First of all  let's explain what the performance is. So many artists  so many different explanations  but my explanation for performance is very simple. Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens. The audience and the performer make the piece together. And the difference between performance and theater is huge. In the theater  the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. In the performance  the blood is the material  and the razor blade or knife is the tool. It's all about being there in the real time  and you can't rehearse performance  because you can't do many of these types of things twice    ever. Which is very important  the performance is    you know  all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. We're afraid of suffering  we're afraid of pain  we're afraid of mortality. So what I'm doing    I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience. I'm using your energy  and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can. And then I liberate myself from these fears. And I'm your mirror. If I can do this for myself  you can do it for you. After Belgrade  where I was born  I went to Amsterdam. And you know  I've been doing performances since the last    years. And here I met Ulay  and he was the person I actually fell in love with. And we made  for    years  performances together. You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets  I exchange into love and trust. So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart. So  heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on  is about trust  is about total trust to another human being. Our relationship was    years  and we worked on so many subjects  both male and female energy. And as every relationship comes to an end  ours went too. We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say  you know   This is over.  We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye. I started at the Yellow Sea  and he started from the Gobi Desert. We walked  each of us  three months  two and a half thousand kilometers. It was the mountains  it was difficult. It was climbing  it was ruins. It was  you know  going through the    Chinese provinces  this was before China was open in '  . And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye. And then our relationship stopped. And now  it completely changed how I see the public. And one very important piece I made in those days was  Balkan Baroque.  And this was the time of the Balkan Wars  and I wanted to create some very strong  charismatic image  something that could serve for any war at any time  because the Balkan Wars are now finished  but there's always some war  somewhere. So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead  big  bloody cow bones. You can't wash the blood  you never can wash shame off the wars. So I'm washing this six hours  six days  and wars are coming off these bones  and becoming possible    an unbearable smell. But then something stays in the memory. I want to show you the one who really changed my life  and this was the performance in MoMa  which I just recently made. This performance    when I said to the curator   I'm just going to sit at the chair  and there will be an empty chair at the front  and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want.  The curator said to me   That's ridiculous  you know  this is New York  this chair will be empty  nobody has time to sit in front of you.  But I sit for three months. And I sit everyday  eight hours    the opening of the museum    and    hours on Friday when the museum is open    hours  and I never move. And I removed the table and I'm still sitting  and this changed everything. This performance  maybe    or    years ago    nothing would have happened. But the need of people to actually experience something different  the public was not anymore the group    relation was one to one. I was watching these people  they would come and sit in front of me  but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position  and finally  they sit. And what happened  They are observed by the other people  they're photographed  they're filmed by the camera  they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves. And that makes a difference. There was so much pain and loneliness  there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes  because in the gaze with that total stranger  that you never even say one word    everything happened. And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months  I am not the same anymore. And I understood that I have a very strong mission  that I have to communicate this experience to everybody. And this is how  for me  was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts. Because thinking about immateriality  performance is time based art. It's not like a painting. You have the painting on the wall  the next day it's there. Performance  if you are missing it  you only have the memory  or the story of somebody else telling you  but you actually missed the whole thing. So you have to be there. And in my point  if you talk about immaterial art  music is the highest    absolutely highest art of all  because it's the most immaterial. And then after this is performance  and then everything else. That's my subjective way. This institute is going to happen in Hudson  upstate New York  and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas  an idea. And it's very simple. If you want to get experience  you have to give me your time. You have to sign the contract before you enter the building  that you will spend there a full six hours  you have to give me your word of honor. It's something so old fashioned  but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before    that's not my problem. But it's six hours  the experience. And then after you finish  you get a certificate of accomplishment  so get home and frame it if you want. This is orientation hall. The public comes in  and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats. It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch  your iPhone  your iPod  your computer and everything digital  electronic. And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time. Because there is nothing wrong with technology  our approach to technology is wrong. We are losing the time we have for ourselves. This is an institute to actually give you back this time. So what you do here  first you start slow walking  you start slowing down. You're going back to simplicity. After slow walking  you're going to learn how to drink water    very simple  drinking water for maybe half an hour. After this  you're going to the magnet chamber  where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body. Then after this  you go to crystal chamber. After crystal chamber  you go to eye gazing chamber  after eye gazing chamber  you go to a chamber where you are lying down. So it's the three basic positions of the human body  sitting  standing and lying. And slow walking. And there is a sound chamber. And then after you've seen all of this  and prepared yourself mentally and physically  then you are ready to see something with a long duration  like in immaterial art. It can be music  it can be opera  it can be a theater piece  it can be film  it can be video dance. You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable. In the long duration chairs  you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work. And if you fall asleep  which is very possible because it's been a long day  you're going to be transported to the parking lot. And you know  sleeping is very important. In sleeping  you're still receiving art. So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time  and then after this you just  you know  go back  you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate. So this institute right now is virtual. Right now  I am just making my institute in Brazil  then it's going to be in Australia  then it's coming here  to Canada and everywhere. And this is to experience a kind of simple method  how you go back to simplicity in your own life. Counting rice will be another thing. You know  if you count rice you can make life  too. How to count rice for six hours  It's incredibly important. You know  you go through this whole range of being bored  being angry  being completely frustrated  not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished    or counting sand in the desert. Or having the sound isolated situation    that you have headphones  that you don't hear anything  and you're just there together without sound  with the people experiencing silence  just the simple silence. We are always doing things we like in our life. And this is why you're not changing. You do things in life    it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. But my method is to do things I'm afraid of  the things I fear  the things I don't know  to go to territory that nobody's ever been. And then also to include the failure. I think failure is important because if you go  if you experiment  you can fail. If you don't go into that area and you don't fail  you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. And I think that human beings right now need a change  and the only change to be made is a personal level change. You have to make the change on yourself. Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us  is to start with yourself. It's so easy to criticize how it's different  the things in the world and they're not right  and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars    the killing. But what we do on the personal level    what is our contribution to this whole thing  Can you turn to your neighbor  the one you don't know  and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes  right now  I'm asking two minutes of your time  that's so little. Breathe slowly  don't try to blink  don't be self conscious. Be relaxed. And just look a complete stranger in your eyes  in his eyes. Thank you for trusting me. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Thank you so much. What was the most difficult job you ever did  Was it working in the sun  Was it working to provide food for a family or a community  Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property  Was it working alone or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed  but that might improve human health or save a life  Was it working to build something  create something  make a work of art  Was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood or appreciated  The people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention  our love and our deepest support. But people aren't the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs. These jobs are also done by the plants  the animals and the ecosystems on our planet  including the ecosystems I study  the tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs are farmers. They provide food  income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Coral reefs are security guards. The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves  and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play. Coral reefs are chemists. The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs. And coral reefs are artists. The structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth. And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources. So for all of these reasons  all of these ecosystem services  economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. And yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain  we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that. We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer  sewage  diseases  oil  pollution  sediments. We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats  our fins  our bulldozers  and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea  warmed the waters and made storms worse. And these would all be bad on their own  but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse. I'll give you an example. Where I live and work  in Cura ao  a tropical storm went by a few years ago. And on the eastern end of the island  where the reefs are intact and thriving  you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed. But in town  where corals had died from overfishing  from pollution  the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left. This is a coral that I studied during my PhD    I got to know it quite well. And after this storm took off half of its tissue  it became infested with algae  the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died. This magnification of threats  this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the  slippery slope to slime.  It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime. Now  this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs. But I have a confession to make  that phrase drives me nuts. Whether I see it in a tweet  in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure  that phrase bothers me  because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades. And yet  almost everyone I meet  no matter how educated  is not sure what a coral is or where they come from. How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand  If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from  or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is  why would we expect them to care about saving them  So let's change that. What is a coral and where does it come from  Corals are born in a number of different ways  but most often by mass spawning  all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year  releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column  packaged into bundles with sperm cells. And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart. And hopefully    hopefully    at the surface of the ocean  they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals. And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef    so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface. When they're fertilized  they do what any other animal egg does  divides in half again and again and again. Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year. At the end of all this cell division  they turn into a swimming larva    a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed  but with all of the sensory systems that we have. They can sense color and light  textures  chemicals  pH. They can even feel pressure waves  they can hear sound. And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives. So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. They attach in the place they find most suitable  they build a skeleton underneath themselves  they build a mouth and tentacles  and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs. One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again  leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun. Given hundreds of years and many species  what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases  covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals. Now  there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet  maybe      . But these systems house millions and millions of other species  and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems  and it's where we're finding our new medicines. It's how we find new sources of food. I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura ao  where we still have reefs that look like this. But  indeed  much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this. Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs  and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes. But in my research  I'm not interested in looking backward. My colleagues and I in Cura ao are interested in looking forward at what might be. And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic. Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago  we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway. And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't. They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet. So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura ao  we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage  what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process. I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions. A few years ago we took a  D printer and we made coral choice surveys    different colors and different textures  and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle. And we found that corals  even without the biology involved  still prefer white and pink  the colors of a healthy reef. And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes  where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator. So we can use this knowledge  we can go back and say we need to restore those factors    that pink  that white  those crevices  those hard surfaces    in our conservation projects. We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater  like a sea wall or a pier. We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals. Now in addition to the surfaces  we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs. Starting about six years ago  I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled. And I tried those one by one by one  looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach. And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process. So as we speak  my colleagues in Cura ao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab  and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater. Now in addition to these tools  we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under studied. This is one of my favorite corals  and always has been  dendrogyra cylindrus  the pillar coral. I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape  because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare. Finding one of these on a reef is a treat. In fact  it's so rare  that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list. And this was in part because in over    years of research surveys  scientists had never found a baby pillar coral. We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce  or if they were still reproducing. So four years ago  we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura ao. We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida  who had seen one in       one in       and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura ao and we caught it. Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue  about to release them into the seawater. And here's a male on the right  releasing sperm. We collected this  we got it back to the lab  we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab. Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles  and thanks to the    years of practice we've had in Cura ao at raising other coral species  we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach  and turn into metamorphosed corals. So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw. And I have to say    if you think baby pandas are cute  this is cuter. So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process  the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them. And this is true all around the world  scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos  to get them to settle  maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures  so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often. But this is still so low tech. We are limited by the space on our bench  the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour. Now  compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society. We have advanced medical technology  we have defense technology  we have scientific technology  we even have advanced technology for art. But our technology for conservation is behind. Think back to the most difficult job you ever did. Many of you would say it was being a parent. My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined. I've been trying to help corals become parents for over    years now. And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul. But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents. The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago  and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab. And here you see one embryo dividing  alongside    eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up. They'll be infected with bacteria  they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance. We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef  always suffering from low fertility. Whatever the cause  we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or  yes  maybe save coral reefs. So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi. They're providing us with art and food and medicine. And we almost took out an entire generation of corals. But a few made it anyway  despite our best efforts  and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future  their coral babies. Thank you so much. What does a working mother look like  If you ask the Internet  this is what you'll be told. Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap. But no  this isn't a working mother. You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them. That theme is amazing natural lighting  which  as we all know  is the hallmark of every American workplace. There are thousands of images like these. Just put the term  working mother  into any Google image search engine  stock photo site. They're all over the Internet  they're topping blog posts and news pieces  and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us  that when it comes to new working motherhood in America  everything's fine. But it's not fine. As a country  we are sending millions of women back to work every year  incredibly and kind of horrifically soon after they give birth. That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem. I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images  which look nothing like my life  that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body. I'm just going to show you two of them. Nothing says  Give that girl a promotion  like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation. You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo  because that's not how this works  not for most working mothers. Did you know  and this will ruin your day  that every time a toilet is flushed  its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours  And yet  for many new working mothers  this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies. I put these things  a whole dozen of them  into the world. I wanted to make a point. I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door  because now  total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby. I'm going to share    of their stories with you today. They are totally real  some of them are very raw  and not one of them looks anything like this. Here's the first.  I was an active duty service member at a federal prison. I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C section. A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation ' so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway.  Most of the stories that these women  total strangers  send to me now  are not actually even about breastfeeding. A woman wrote to me to say   I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks. Emotionally  I was a wreck. Physically  I had a severe hemorrhage during labor  and major tearing  so I could barely get up  sit or walk. My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season.  I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye because then we'd be horrified  and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it. So we choose to look at  and believe  this image. I don't really know what's going on in this picture  because I find it weird and slightly creepy. Like  what is she doing  But I know what it tells us. It tells us that everything's fine. This working mother  all working mothers and all of their babies  are fine. There's nothing to see here. And anyway  women have made a choice  so none of it's even our problem. I want to break this choice thing down into two parts. The first choice says that women have chosen to work. So  that's not true. Today in America  women make up    percent of the workforce  and in    percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner. Our paid work is a part  a huge part  of the engine of this economy  and it is essential for the engines of our families. On a national level  our paid work is not optional. Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies  so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices. You know  that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing  can sound correct. I didn't make you have a baby. I certainly wasn't there when that happened. But that stance ignores a fundamental truth  which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional. The babies that women  many of them working women  are having today  will one day fill our workforce  protect our shores  make up our tax base. Our procreation on a national scale is not optional. These aren't choices. We need women to work. We need working women to have babies. So we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable  right  OK  this is pop quiz time  what percentage of working women in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave     percent.    percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby. So now you're thinking about unpaid leave. It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work. Because of the way it's structured  all kinds of exceptions  half of new mothers are ineligible for it. Here's what that looks like.  We adopted our son. When I got the call  the day he was born  I had to take off work. I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA  so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave. When I took time off to meet my newborn son  I lost my job.  These corporate stock photos hide another reality  another layer. Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave  most women can't afford to take much of it at all. A nurse told me   I didn't qualify for short term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks. We just couldn't manage any longer. Physically it was hard  but emotionally it was worse. I struggled for months being away from my son.  So this decision to go back to work so early  it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances  but it's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy. A waitress told me   With my first baby  I was back at work five weeks postpartum. With my second  I had to have major surgery after giving birth  so I waited until six weeks to go back. I had third degree tears.     percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.  I worked as a bartender and cook  average of    hours a week while pregnant. I had to return to work before my baby was a month old  working    hours a week. One of my coworkers was only able to afford    days off with her baby.  Of course  this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications. Childbirth is  and always will be  an enormous psychological event. A teacher told me   I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born. I already suffer from anxiety  but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable.  Statistically speaking  the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby  the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety  and among many potential consequences of those disorders  suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum. Heads up that this next story    I've never met this woman  but I find it hard to get through.  I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential  irreplaceable and formative time with my son. Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken. For months  all I remember is the screaming  colic  they said. On the inside  I was drowning. Every morning  I asked myself how much longer I could do it. I was allowed to bring my baby to work. I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble. I hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed. I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment. Every day  I cried all the way to work and all the way home again. I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day  I'd make up at night from home. I thought  there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this.  So those are the mothers. What of the babies  As a country  do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers  I say we don't  not until they're of working and tax paying and military serving age. We tell them we'll see them in    years  and getting there is kind of on them. One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have    or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year  so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases. But those things are hidden behind images like this. America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies. Whatever time you get together  you should be grateful for it  and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers. That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear. A woman told me   I went back at eight weeks after my C section because my husband was out of work. Without me  my daughter had failure to thrive. She wouldn't take a bottle. She started losing weight. Thankfully  my manager was very understanding. He let my mom bring my baby  who was on oxygen and a monitor  four times a shift so I could nurse her.  There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers. Care to guess who they are  The first eight make up eight million in total population. They are Papua New Guinea  Suriname and the tiny island nations of Micronesia  Marshall Islands  Nauru  Niue  Palau and Tonga. Number nine is the United States of America  with     million people. Oh  that's it. That's the end of the list. Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries  but we say   We couldn't possibly do that.  We say that the market will solve this problem  and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest educated and highest paid among us. Remember that    percent  Those middle  and low income women are not going to participate in that. We know that there are staggering economic  financial  physical and emotional costs to this approach. We have decided    decided  not an accident  to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies. We know the price tag is higher for low income women  therefore disproportionately for women of color. We pass them on anyway. All of this is to America's shame. But it's also to America's risk. Because what would happen if all of these individual so called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies. One woman told me   New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic. When we talk about expanding our family now  we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby. If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first  we might stick with one kid.  The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is  .  live births per woman. In America today  we are at  .  . We need women to have babies  and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that. What would happen to work force  to innovation  to GDP  if one by one  the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can't bear to do this thing more than once  I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading  and you've guessed what it is. It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future. Childbirth is a public good. This leave should be state subsidized. It should have no exceptions for small businesses  length of employment or entrepreneurs. It should be able to be shared between partners. I've talked today a lot about mothers  but co parents matter on so many levels. Not one more woman should have to go back to work while she is hobbling and bleeding. Not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding. Not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the NICU. Not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work  their needed work and their needed parenthood  is their problem alone. The catch is that when this is happening to a new family  it is consuming  and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before  so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf. But all of us have voices. I am done  done having babies  and you might be pre baby  you might be post baby  you might be no baby. It should not matter. We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue  or even a women's issue. This is an American issue. We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. We need to stop being comforted by them. We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world. We need to recognize that this American reality is to our dishonor and to our peril. Because this is not  this is not  and this is not what a working mother looks like. You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see. That's largely true. Actually  I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. But there is also a lot that I can do. This is me rock climbing for the first time. Actually  I love sports and I can play many sports  like swimming  skiing  skating  scuba diving  running and so on. But there is one limitation  somebody needs to help me. I want to be independent. I lost my sight at the age of    in a swimming pool accident. I was an active  independent teenager  and suddenly I became blind. The hardest thing for me was losing my independence. Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. For example  one of my challenges was textbooks. Back then  there were no personal computers  no Internet  no smartphones. So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks  and I had to create my own books in Braille. Can you imagine  Of course  my brothers were not happy about it  and later  I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them. I think they tried to stay away from me. I don't blame them. I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone. That became my strong desire to ignite innovation. Jump ahead to the mid     s. I got to know cutting edge technologies and I thought to myself  how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille  These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. That's the moment my innovation journey began. I started developing digital book technologies  such as a digital Braille editor  digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. Today  every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks  by using personal computers and mobile devices  in Braille or in voice. This may not surprise you  since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in     . But Braille went digital many years before digital books  already in the late     s  almost    years ago. Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then. And this is actually not the first time this happened  because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation. The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities. Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life. In the '  s  people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing. I remember the first time I went on the web. I was astonished. I could access newspapers at any time and every day. I could even search for any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet  and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice  which dramatically simplified the user interface. This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in       first in Japanese and later  translated into    languages. When I developed the Home Page Reader  I got many comments from users. One that I strongly remember said   For me  the Internet is a small window to the world.  It was a revolutionary moment for the blind. The cyber world became accessible  and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses  way beyond what I imagined. It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking. Today  I am more independent  but it is still not enough. For example  when I approached the stage just now  I needed assistance. My goal is to come up here independently. And not just here. My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you. OK  now let me show you the latest technologies. This is a smartphone app that we are working on. EV  Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right. EV  Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. Chieko Asakawa  Hi  Nick  CA  Where are you going  You look so happy. Nick  Oh    well  my paper just got accepted. CA  That's great  Congratulations. Nick  Thanks. Wait    how'd you know it was me  and that I look happy  Man  Hi. CA  Oh ... hi. EV  He is not talking to you  but on his phone. EV  Potato chips. EV  Dark chocolate with almonds. EV  You gained   pounds since yesterday  take apple instead of chocolate. EV  Approaching. EV  You arrived. CA  Now ... Thank you. So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching  in which mood    we are still working on that part. And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social. So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. We call this cognitive assistance. It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers. Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities    in other words  our five senses. This technology is only in an early stage  but eventually  I'll be able to find a classroom on campus  enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me. It will become my best buddy  and yours. So  this really is a great challenge. It is a challenge that needs collaboration  which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities. Just this morning  we announced the open source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. The frontier is the real world. The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder. I hope to work with you to explore the new era  and the next time that I'm on this stage  through technology and innovation  I will be able to walk up here all by myself. Thank you so much.

National record attempt.    meters.      meters  Guillaume N ry  Thank you. Thank you very much  thanks for the warm welcome. That dive you just watched is a journey    a journey between two breaths. A journey that takes place between two breaths    the last one before diving into the water  and the first one  coming back to the surface. That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility  a journey into the unknown. But it's also  and above all  an inner journey  where a number of things happen  physiologically as well as mentally. And that's why I'm here today  to share my journey with you and to take you along with me. So  we start with the last breath. As you noticed  that last breath in is slow  deep and intense. It ends with a special technique called the carp  which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it. When I leave the surface  I have about    liters of air in my lungs. As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in  the diving reflex. The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop. My heart beat will drop from about       per minute to about       beats per minute in a matter of seconds  almost immediately. Next  the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction  which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities to feed the most important organs  the lungs  the heart and the brain. This mechanism is innate. I cannot control it. If you go underwater  even if you've never done it before  you'll experience the exact same effects. All human beings share this characteristic. And what's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals    all marine mammals  dolphins  whales  sea lions  etc. When they dive deep into the ocean  these mechanisms become activated  but to a greater extent. And  of course  it works much better for them. It's absolutely fascinating. Right as I leave the surface  nature gives me a push in the right direction  allowing me to descend with confidence. So as I dive deeper into the blue  the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs. And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float  the farther down I go  the more pressure there is on my lungs  the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall. And at one point  around    or    meters down  I don't even need to swim. My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself  and I enter what's called the free fall phase. The free fall phase is the best part of the dive. It's the reason I still dive. Because it feels like you're being pulled down and you don't need to do anything. I can go from    meters to     meters without making a single movement. I let myself be pulled by the depths  and it feels like I'm flying underwater. It's truly an amazing feeling    an extraordinary feeling of freedom. And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom.    meters down     meters down  and between    and    meters  a second physiological response kicks in. My lungs reach residual volume  below which they're not supposed to be compressed  in theory. And this second response is called blood shift  or  pulmonary erection  in French. I prefer  blood shift.  So blood shift    how does it work  The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood    which is caused by the suction    so the lungs can harden and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed. It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing  from sticking together and caving in. Thanks to this phenomenon  which we also share with marine mammals  I'm able to continue with my dive.        meters down  I keep falling  faster and faster  because the pressure is crushing my body more and more. Below    meters  the pressure becomes a lot stronger  and I start to feel it physically. I really start to feel the suffocation. You can see what it looks like    not pretty at all. The diaphragm is completely collapsed  the rib cage is squeezed in  and mentally  there is something going on as well. You may be thinking   This doesn't look enjoyable. How do you do it   If I relied on my earthly reflexes    what do we do above water when there's a problem  We resist  we go against it. We fight. Underwater  that doesn't work. If you try that underwater  you might tear your lungs  spit up blood  develop an edema and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time. So what you need to do  mentally  is to tell yourself that nature and the elements are stronger than you. And so I let the water crush me. I accept the pressure and go with it. At this point  my body receives this information  and my lungs start relaxing. I relinquish all control  and relax completely. The pressure starts crushing me  and it doesn't feel bad at all. I even feel like I'm in a cocoon  protected. And the dive continues.        meters down         .     meters    the magic number. In every sport  it's a magic number. For swimmers and athletes and also for us  free divers  it's a number everyone dreams of. Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to     meters. And it's a symbolic number for us  because in the     s  doctors and physiologists did their math  and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below     meters. Below that  they said  the human body would implode. And then the Frenchman  Jacques Mayol    you all know him as the hero in  The Big Blue     came along and dived down to     meters. He even reached     meters. At that time  he was doing  no limits.  He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon  just like in the movie. Today  we go down     meters in no limit free diving. I can do     meters by simply using muscle strength. And in a way  it's all thanks to him  because he challenged known facts  and with a sweep of his hand  got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves. He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt. So I carry on with my dive.              . The bottom is getting closer.          meters. I'm at the bottom. And now  I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place. Close your eyes. Imagine you get to     meters. The surface is far  far away. You're alone. There's hardly any light. It's cold    freezing cold. The pressure is crushing you completely       times stronger than on the surface. And I know what you're thinking   This is horrible. What the hell am I doing here  He's insane.  But no. That's not what I think when I'm down there. When I'm at the bottom  I feel good. I get this extraordinary feeling of well being. Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions and let myself go. I feel great  without the need to breathe. Although  you'd agree  I should be worried. I feel like a tiny dot  a little drop of water  floating in the middle of the ocean. And each time  I picture the same image.  The Pale Blue Dot  It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to. Do you know what it is  It's planet Earth. Planet Earth  photographed by the Voyager probe  from   billion kilometers away. And it shows that our home is that small dot over there  floating in the middle of nothing. That's how I feel when I'm at the bottom  at     meters. I feel like a small dot  a speck of dust  stardust  floating in the middle of the cosmos  in the middle of nothing  in the immensity of space. It's a fascinating sensation  because when I look up  down  left  right  in front  behind  I see the same thing  the infinite deep blue. Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this    looking all around you  and seeing the same thing. It's extraordinary. And at that moment  I still get that feeling each time  building up inside of me    the feeling of humility. Looking at this picture  I feel very humble    just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom    because I'm nothing  I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space. And it still is absolutely fascinating. I decide to go back to the surface  because this is not where I belong. I belong up there  on the surface. So I start heading back up. I get something of a shock at the very moment when I decide to go up. First  because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom. It pulled you down on the way in  and will do the same on the way up. You have to swim twice as hard. Then  I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis. I don't know if you've heard of that. It's called nitrogen narcosis. It's something that happens to scuba divers  but it can happen to free divers. It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood  which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind. A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head. You can't control them  and you shouldn't try to    you have to let it happen. The more you try to control it  the harder it is to manage. Then  a third thing happens  the desire to breathe. I'm not a fish  I'm a human being  and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact. Around        meters  you start to feel the need to breathe. And with everything else that's going on  you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic. When that happens  you think   Where's the surface  I want to go up. I want to breathe now.  You should not do that. Never look up to the surface    not with your eyes  or your mind. You should never picture yourself up there. You have to stay in the present. I look at the rope right in front of me  leading me back to the surface. And I focus on that  on the present moment. Because if I think about the surface  I panic. And if I panic  it's over. Time goes faster this way. And at    meters  deliverance. I'm not alone any more. The safety divers  my guardian angels  join me. They leave the surface  we meet at    meters  and they escort me for the final few meters  where potential problems could arise. Every time I see them  I think to myself   It's thanks to you.  It's thanks to them  my team  that I'm here. It brings back the sense of humility. Without my team  without all the people around me  the adventure into the deep would be impossible. A journey into the deep is above all a group effort. So I'm happy to finish my journey with them  because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.    meters     meters  my lungs slowly return to their normal volume. Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface. Five meters below the surface  I start to breathe out  so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in. And so I arrive at the surface. Air floods into my lungs. It's like being born again  a relief. It feels good. Though the journey was extraordinary  I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body. It's an extraordinary sensation  but at the same time it's traumatizing. It's a shock to the system  as you can you imagine. I go from complete darkness to the light of day  from the near silence of the depths to the commotion up top. In terms of touch  I go from the soft  velvety feeling of the water  to air rubbing across my face. In terms of smell  there is air rushing into my lungs. And in return  my lungs open up. They were completely squashed just    seconds ago  and now  they've opened up again. So all of this affects quite a lot of things. I need a few seconds to come back  and to feel  all there  again. But that needs to happen quickly  because the judges are there to verify my performance  I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition. You saw in the video  I was doing a so called exit protocol. Once at the surface  I have    seconds to take off my nose clip  give this signal and say  English   I am OK.  Plus  you need to be bilingual. On top of everything    that's not very nice. Once the protocol is completed  the judges show me a white card  and that's when the joy starts. I can finally celebrate what has just happened. So  the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving. Luckily  it's far from just that. For the past few years  I've been trying to show another side of free diving  because the media mainly talks about competitions and records. But free diving is more than just that. It's about being at ease in the water. It's extremely beautiful  very poetic and artistic. So my wife and I decided to film it and try to show another side of it  mostly to make people want to go into the water. Let me show you some images to finish my story. It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos. I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing  you'll realize that when you stop breathing  you stop thinking  too. It calms your mind. Today  in the   st century  we're under so much pressure. Our minds are overworked  we think at a million miles an hour  we're always stressed. Being able to free dive lets you  just for a moment  relax your mind. Holding your breath underwater means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness. It means being underwater  floating  with your body completely relaxed  letting go of all your tensions. This is our plight in the   st century  our backs hurt  our necks hurt  everything hurts  because we're stressed and tense all the time. But when you're in the water  you let yourself float  as if you were in space. You let yourself go completely. It's an extraordinary feeling. You can finally get in touch with your body  mind and spirit. Everything feels better  all at once. Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly. We breathe with our first breath at birth  up until our last one. Breathing gives rhythm to our lives. Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better. Holding your breath in the sea  not necessarily at     meters  but maybe at two or three  putting on your goggles  a pair of flippers  means you can go see another world  another universe  completely magical. You can see little fish  seaweed  the flora and fauna  you can watch it all discreetly  sliding underwater  looking around  and coming back to the surface  leaving no trace. It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that. And if I may say one more thing  holding your breath  being in the water  finding this underwater world    it's all about connecting with yourself. You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory that dates back millions of years  to our marine origins. The day you get back into the water  when you hold your breath for a few seconds  you will reconnect with those origins. And I guarantee it's absolute magic. I encourage you to try it out. Thank you. Great things happen at intersections. In fact  I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections  in the liminal space  where by liminal I mean the space in between. There's freedom in that in between  freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not quite here  not quite there  a new self definition. Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind  like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris  or Times Square in New York City  both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people. Other intersections  like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma  Alabama  or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson  Missouri  also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings  ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice. Beyond the physical landscape of our planet  some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections. Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust  instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull. Stars die by this same intersection  this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms  intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things. We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us. To be intersectional  then  is to occupy a position at an intersection. I've lived the entirety of my life in the in between  in the liminal space between dreams and reality  race and gender  poverty and plenty  science and society. I am both black and a woman. Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies  this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities. I am also an astrophysicist. I study blazars  supermassive  hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand. I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was    years old. I had no idea that at that time  according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African American women in physics  only    black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics related discipline  and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy related field did so just one year before my birth. As I journeyed along my path  I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection  the tremendous opportunity to self define  the collision of expectation and experience  the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and  sometimes  the explosive pain of regeneration. I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart. Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives. This thrust my mother  my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet. Thus  I was one of roughly    percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals. Thankfully  Norfolk State University provided me with full funding  and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics. After graduation  and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics  I fell through the cracks. It was a poster that saved my dream  and some really incredible people and programs. The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists. It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl  probably around    years old  looking studiously at some physics equations. I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster  which to this day still hangs in my office. I described to them in the email my educational path  and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD. They directed me to the Fisk Vanderbilt University Bridge Program  itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions. After two years out of school  they accepted me into the program  and I found myself again on the path to the PhD. After receiving my master's at Fisk  I went on to Yale to complete my PhD. Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations  I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD. It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space. I was ostracized by many of my classmates  one of whom went so far as to invite me to  do what I really came here to do  as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up. I wish that were an isolated occurrence  but for many women of color in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  or STEM  this is something they have long endured. One hundred percent of the    women of color interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias  including being mistaken for the janitorial staff. This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women interviewed for this study  which comprised     women in total. While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position  and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs  it was a clear attempt to put me in my place. While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter  the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability. Beyond that  though  it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face. That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM  who are inexorably  unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities. STEM itself is an intersectional term  such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines. Science  the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry  physics  biology  cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics. Engineering requires the application of basic science and math to the lived experience. Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math  engineering and science. Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone  decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world. STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece. This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined with other disciplines. The purpose for this talk is twofold  first  to say directly to every black  Latina  indigenous  First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender  that you can be anything you want to be. My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist  but beyond that  anything you want. Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are  you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be. Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine. Secondly  among the most pressing issues of our time  most now find their intersection with STEM. We have as a global society solved most of the single faceted issues of our time. Those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow. Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections. We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity. One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander  a black woman plasma physicist  who passed away this past July after a    year bout with breast cancer. She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission  which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet  and the  .  billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter  two high profile scientific victories for NASA  the United States and the world. Dr. Alexander said it this way   I'm used to walking between two cultures. For me  it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can't do every day.  This shows exactly the power of a liminal person. She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time  and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was. Jessica Matthews  inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products  like soccer balls  that generate renewable energy as you play with them  said it this way   A major part of invention isn't just creating things  it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world.  The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories  the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race  gender and innovation. Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space  I'm proud to report that when I graduated  I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then     year history. I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time  things like educational inequities  police brutality  HIV AIDS  climate change  genetic editing  artificial intelligence and Mars exploration. This is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet. Women of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time. Thus  we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience. This outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people whose experiences  positive and negative  enrich the conversations in ways that outmatch even the best resourced homogenous groups. This is not a request born out of a desire to fit in. It's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity without precisely this collaboration  this bringing together of the liminal  the differently lived  distinctly experienced and disparately impacted. Simply put  we cannot be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear. Thank you. In the past few months  I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. One day  I was invited to an important event  and I wanted to wear something special and new for it. So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear. I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day  and I had access to  D printers. So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer  and I loaded the file on the printer. It just printed the pieces overnight. The next morning  I just took all the pieces  assembled them together in my hotel room  and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now. So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes. For my senior collection at fashion design school  I decided to try and  D print an entire fashion collection from my home. The problem was that I barely knew anything about  D printing  and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks. I always felt most creative when I worked from home. I loved experimenting with new materials  and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects. I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials  and then bring them home to experiment on. As you can probably imagine  my roommates didn't like that at all. So I decided to move on to working with big machines  ones that didn't fit in my living room. I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies  like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing. One summer break  I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. We worked on two incredible dresses that were  D printed. They were amazing    like you can see here. But I had a few issues with them. They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them  and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms. With  D printing  the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted  but still  they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio. Later that year  a friend gave me a  D printed necklace  printed using a home printer. I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship. So I looked at the necklace  and then I thought   If I can print a necklace from home  why not print my clothes from home  too   I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell    I could just design them and print them directly from home. I found a small makerspace  where I learned everything I know about  D printing. Right away  they literally gave me the key to the lab  so I could experiment into the night  every night. The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament  Filament is the material you feed the printer with. And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA  which is a hard and scratchy  breakable material. The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex  which is a new kind of filament. It's strong  yet very flexible. And with it  I was able to print the first garment  the red jacket that had the word  Libert       freedom  in French    embedded into it. I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. And actually  you can easily download this jacket  and easily change the word to something else. For example  your name or your sweetheart's name. So the printer plates are small  so I had to piece the garment together  just like a puzzle. And I wanted to solve another challenge. I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. That's when I found an open source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love. And with it  I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. And it actually even looks a little bit like lace. So I took his file and I modified it  and changed it  played with it    many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print another       more hours to complete printing my collection. So I brought six printers to my home and just printed     . And this is actually a really slow process  but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower    years ago  so  D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours  or even minutes. So you guys  you want to see what it looks like  Audience  Yeah  Danit Peleg  Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits. Almost everything here she's wearing  I printed from my home. Even her shoes are printed. Audience  Wow  Audience  Cool  Danit Peleg  Thank you  Rebecca. So I think in the future  materials will evolve  and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today  like cotton or silk. Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements. Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs  but now you can just download the music    digital music    directly to your phone. Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital  just like this skirt is. Thank you so much.  Thank You  Can I get a show of hands    how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year  That's pretty good. Well  it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year. And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world  sometimes  things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic. I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year. And it turns out that  although Ebola spreads through these more range limited  large droplet routes  there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin. The worst part is  when we take a look at some of the numbers  it's pretty scary. So with H N   there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to    other people. And then there was this other guy with SARS  who managed to go on a three hour flight and spread the disease to    other people. That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower. When we take a look at this  what we also find is that it's very difficult to pre screen for these diseases. So when someone actually goes on a plane  they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms  and they could  in turn  spread the disease to many other people in the cabin. How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin  as you see in blue. And then also  that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate   .   percent of pathogens near the outlets. What happens right now  though  is that we have this mixing airflow pattern. So if someone were to actually sneeze  that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter. So I thought  clearly  this is a pretty serious problem. I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane  so I decided to build a computer instead. It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics  what we're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane. And so how  essentially  this works is you would start out with these  D drawings    these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet. I take that and then I put it into this  D modeling software  really building that  D model. And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces  essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it. And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin  throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation. So what we get  actually  with the conventional cabin is this  you'll notice the middle person sneezing  and we go  Splat      it goes right into people's faces. It's pretty disgusting. From the front  you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time. And when we take a look at that from the side  you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin. The first thing I thought was   This is no good.  So I actually conducted more than    different simulations and ultimately  I came up with this solution right here. This is what I call a    patent pending    Global Inlet Director. With this  we're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about    times  and increase fresh air inhalation by about     percent. So how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane. So it's very cost effective to install and we can do this directly overnight. All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go. And the results that we get are absolutely amazing. Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns  we can create these walls of air that come down in between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones. So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again  but this time  we're able to effectively push that down to the filters for elimination. And same thing from the side  you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down. So if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed  you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes  and this time  we're pushing that straight down into the outlet before it gets a chance to infect any other people. So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all. Take a look at that from the side as well  you see a very efficient system. And in short  with this system  we win. When we take a look at what this means  what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes  but also if the window seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle seat passenger sneezes. And so with this solution  what does this mean for the world  Well  when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life  we can see with this  D model that I built over here  essentially using  D printing  we can see those same airflow patterns coming down  right to the passengers. In the past  the SARS epidemic actually cost the world about    billion dollars. And in the future  a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars. So before  it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months  spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something. But now  we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away. So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification  flight testing  and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes. But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions. And two years ago  even  this project would not have happened  just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it. But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is  it's really the golden era for innovation. And so the question I ask all of you today is  why wait  Together  we can build the future today. Thanks. Nicole Paris  TEDYouth  make some noise  TEDYouth  make some    Are you ready  Are you ready  Ed Cage  Yeah  yeah  yeah  EC  Y'all like that  Let me show you how we used to do it    NP  Get it pops  go ahead. EC  ... when I was growing up in the '  s. NP  Pops  pops  pops  pops  pops  pops  hold up  hold up  hold up  hold up  Oh my God. OK  he's trying to battle me. Hold on  right now  hold on. Do you remember when you used to beatbox me to sleep  EC  Yeah  yeah  I remember. That's when she was a little baby. We would do something like this. NP  I remember that. NP  All right  pops  pops  pops  chill out  chill out. Hold up  hold up  hold up. EC  Y'all remember the video. This is like a little payback or something for    million people calling me the loser. NP  Hold up  hold up. But a lot of people out there don't really know what beatboxing is  where it started from. EC  Right  right. NP  Where it came from. So why don't you give them a little history    just a tickle    a bit of history of where it comes from. EC  Beatbox started here in New York. That's right  that's right. New York  New York  Everybody like   Yeah   Well  we from St. Louis. NP  Now you can put y'all hands down. EC  But beatbox started here in New York. What you would have is that  when we would go to parties  you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper. But because I don't have electricity coming out of me  we had to emulate what the beats was doing. So when you would see the beatboxer  you would see us over to the side. Then you would see a rapper  and when the rapper began to rap  we would do a simple beat  because back then the beats were simple    or    Those were simple beats. But now  you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now  and they want to humiliate their father  which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you  pay all your tuition   Nicole laughs  especially when you have    million people that just go around and call you  the loser.  Well  I'm taking that to heart. But now we do something different in our house  so we have these jam sessions  and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church. You know  in church  we'll look at each other like  and we'll text the beat to each other. Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking  road trips  airports. NP  Standing right there in the corner   Aw  Dad    listen to that.  Naw  I'm kidding. But you know what  We're talking all about this jam session and everything. EC  Yeah. NP  Why don't we give them a little peek  just a tiny bit of our jam session  NP  Y'all want to hear some jam session  EC  Y'all ready for a jam session  NP  Sorry  I can't hear you. Yeah  Kick it  pops  NP  I'm getting ready to go  EC  Y'all ready  Everybody stand up  Come on  everybody stand up  Get on up  Come on  stretch  NP  That's it. Thank you  Make some noise  EG  Thank you  everybody  NP  Make some noise  Make some noise  Thank you  So when I was a kid ... this was my team. I stunk at sports. I didn't like to play them  I didn't like to watch them. So this is what I did. I went fishing. And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut  and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis. But after I grew up and went to college  and I came home in the early   's  this is what I found. My team had shrunk. It was like literally having your roster devastated. And as I sort of looked into that  from a very personal point of view as a fisherman  I started to kind of figure out  well  what was the rest of the world thinking about it  First place I started to look was fish markets. And when I went to fish markets  in spite of where I was    whether I was in North Carolina  or Paris  or London  or wherever    I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures  again and again    on the menus  on ice    shrimp  tuna  salmon and cod. And I thought this was pretty strange  and as I looked at it  I was wondering  did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market  Well  when I looked into it  I realized that people didn't look at it as their team. Ordinary people  the way they looked at seafood was like this. It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements. We did it before         years ago  when we came out of our caves. If you look at fire pits from        years ago  you'll see raccoons  you'll see  you know  wolves  you'll see all kinds of different creatures. But if you telescope to the age of    you know        years ago  you'll see these four mammals  pigs  cows  sheep and goats. It's true of birds  too. You look at the menus in New York City restaurants     years ago      years ago  you'll see snipe  woodcock  grouse  dozens of ducks  dozens of geese. But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry  and you'll see four  turkeys  ducks  chicken and geese. So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction. But how have we headed in this direction  Well ... first it's a very  very new problem. This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last    years. World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish. All of the technology that we perfected during World War II    sonar  lightweight polymers    all these things were redirected towards fish. And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity  quadrupling in the course of time  from the end of World War II to the present time. And right now that means we're taking between    and    million metric tons out of the sea every year. That's the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year. And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world. Well  that's only half the story. The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture  which is now  only in the last year or two  starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce. So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together  you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year. And again  it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example  because China  in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish  is also the biggest farmer of fish. So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now. The first one    by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West  is shrimp. Shrimp in the wild    as a wild product    is a terrible product.           pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market. In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University  it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon intensive ways of fishing that you can find. So you can farm them  and people do farm them  and they farm them a lot in this very area. Problem is ... the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats    in mangrove forests. Now look at those lovely roots coming down. Those are the things that hold soil together  protect coasts  create habitats for all sorts of young fish  young shrimp  all sorts of things that are important to this environment. Well  this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests. We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last    or    years. That rate of destruction has slowed  but we're still in a major mangrove deficit. The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called  Grinding Nemo.  This phenomenon is very  very relevant to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef. Because what's going on right now  we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp  catching a huge amount of bycatch  that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food. And sometimes  many of these vessels    manned by slaves    are catching these so called  trash fish   fish that we would love to see on a reef  grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed    an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp. The next most consumed seafood in America  and also throughout the West  is tuna. So tuna is this ultimate global fish. These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed. Our own management area  called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization  is called ICCAT  the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it   The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas.  Of course we've seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years  there is total room for improvement  but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish  and to manage it  we have to manage the globe. Well  we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. Many people don't know this but tuna are warm blooded. They can heat their bodies    degrees above ambient temperature  they can swim at over    miles an hour. So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish  right  A farmed fish is    or a fish is cold blooded  it doesn't move too much. That's a great thing for growing protein. But if you've got this crazy  wild creature that swims at    miles an hour and heats its blood    not a great candidate for aquaculture. The next creature    most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West    is salmon. Now salmon got its plundering  too  but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing. This is my home state of Connecticut. Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon. But if you look at this map of Connecticut  every dot on that map is a dam. There are over       dams in the state of Connecticut. I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight    If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi  I feel that we could have an infinitely better world. But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers  and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me  he says   You know  you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut  cause we here in North Carolina  we got        dams.  So it's a national epidemic  it's an international epidemic. And there are dams everywhere  and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. So as a result  we've turned to aquaculture  and salmon is one the most successful  at least from a numbers point of view. When they first started farming salmon  it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon. The industry has  to its credit  greatly improved. They've gotten it below two to one  although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced  they're measuring pellets    pounds of pellets per pound of salmon. Those pellets are in turn reduced fish. So the actual    what's called the FIFO  the fish in and the fish out    kind of hard to say. But in any case  credit to the industry  it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon. Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we're producing. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet. It's growing at something like seven percent per year. And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market  we're still killing a lot of these little fish. And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to  we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs. So we've got chickens and they're eating fish  but weirdly  we also have fish that are eating chickens. Because the byproducts of chickens    feathers  blood  bone    get ground up and fed to fish. So I often wonder  is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish  It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway    All together  though  it results in a terrible mess. What you're talking about is something between    and    million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up. That's the equivalent of a third of a China  or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the sea each and every year. The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing. It's what the industry calls  whitefish.  There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story  I think  is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation  the Filet O Fish sandwich. So the Filet O Fish sandwich actually started as halibut. And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday  nobody came. Because it was a Catholic community  they needed fish. So he went to Ray Kroc and he said   I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich  going to be made out of halibut.  Ray Kroc said   I don't think it's going to work. I want to do a Hula Burger  and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun. But let's do this  let's have a bet. Whosever sandwich sells more  that will be the winning sandwich.  Well  it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win. So he made his halibut sandwich. Unfortunately though  the sandwich came in at    cents. Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at    cents  so he turned to Atlantic cod. We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England. So now the Filet O Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock  it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States    to   billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year. If we go through the pollock  the next choice is probably going to be tilapia. Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of    years ago. It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein  and it's been a godsend to the third world. It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution  it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months. The problem is that when you look about the West  it doesn't do what the West wants it to do. It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile. It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega  s that we all think are going to make us live forever. So what do we do  I mean  first of all  what about this poor fish  the clupeids  The fish that represent a huge part of that    to    million metric tons. Well  one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them  Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon  There are arguments for it. They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market  a fraction of the fuel cost of say  shrimp  and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale. They also are omega   rich  a great source for EPA and DHA. So that is a potential. And if we were to go down that route what I would say is  instead of paying a few bucks a pound    or a few bucks a ton  really    and making it into aquafeed  could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish  Other possibility though  which is much more interesting  is looking at bivalves  particularly mussels. Now  mussels are very high in EPA and DHA  they're similar to canned tuna. They're also extremely fuel efficient. To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market. They require no forage fish  they actually get their omega  s by filtering the water of microalgae. In fact  that's where omega  s come from  they don't come from fish. Microalgae make the omega  s  they're only bioconcentrated in fish. Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration. A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day. And this is incredibly important when we look at the world. Right now  nitrification  overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms. Over     new dead zones have been created in the last    years  tremendous sources of marine life death. We also could look at not a fish at all. We could look at a vegetable. We could look at seaweed  the kelps  all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega  s  can be high in proteins  tremendously good things. They filter the water just like mussels do. And weirdly enough  it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows. Now  I'm not a big fan of cattle. But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited  you're growing seaweed in the water  you don't have to water it    major consideration. And the last fish is a question mark. We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us. This creature would have to be vegetarian  it would have to be fast growing  it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile  that EPA  DHA  omega   fatty acid profile that we're looking for. This exists kind of on paper. I have been reporting on these subjects for    years. Every time I do a new story  somebody tells me   We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out. We can produce a fish that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega  s.  Great. It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up. It is time to scale this up. If we do     million metric tons of seafood  a third of the world catch  stays in the water. So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with. We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds. But if we went with this  or some configuration of it  we might have a little more of this. Thank you. We're at a tipping point in human history  a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home. Even in just the past few years  we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe. NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars  indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy. Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us. Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star. Together  this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky  like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System  and also how much light they receive from their parent sun. In turn  this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not. Unfortunately  at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds  our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.      was the hottest year on record. Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades. These planetary scale environmental  changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course. But I'm not a climate scientist  I'm an astronomer. I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet. You could say that I look for choice alien real estate. Now  as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe  I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth  the more you appreciate our own planet itself. Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best  those of our own Solar System. Consider our neighbor  Mars. Mars is small and rocky  and though it's a bit far from the Sun  it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler. Indeed  it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past  and in part  this is why we study Mars so much. Our rovers  like Curiosity  crawl across its surface  scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it. Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere  trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability. Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars. But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world  places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers  compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live. Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet  places that are lush by comparison with Mars. Even in the driest  highest places on Earth  the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests. I worry    I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long  dark shadow  the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of  the Earth. As much as I love interplanetary exploration  I deeply disagree with this idea. There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars  but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats. Thank you. But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another. No  they're in fact two sides of the same goal  to understand  preserve and improve life into the future. The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. They're just closer to home. If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile  inhospitable spaces here on Earth  perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it. I leave you with a final thought experiment  Fermi's paradox. Many years ago  the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that  given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it  we should have found evidence for alien life by now. So where are they  Well  one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that  as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars  they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with. It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves  but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together. If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation  then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth. Thank you. So  I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you. Over the past    years in the UK  the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market by a ratio of around three to one. There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors  and they start at around       pounds. And they're projected to achieve about    percent growth. The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand. Now  this is a real proposition  and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment  but my interest in it is quite different. I'm an architect and urban designer  and for the past year and a half  I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them. So in the summer  I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice  and it was called  Death in Venice.  And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about  the exhibition was designed to be quite playful  so that people would literally engage with it. So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. As you wave your hand across the map  the name of the piece of real estate    the building or the cemetery    is revealed. And those white shapes that you can see  they're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city. In fact  the majority are cemeteries. We wanted to show that  even though death and burial are things that we might not think about  they're all around us  and they're important parts of our cities. So about half a million people die in the UK each year  and of those  around a quarter will want to be buried. But the UK  like many Western European countries  is running out of burial space  especially in the major cities. And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while  and the main causes are population growth  the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full. There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever  and there's also development pressure    people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops. So they came up with a few solutions. They were like  well  maybe we can reuse those graves after    years. Or maybe we can bury people  like  four deep  so that four people can be buried in the same plot  and we can make more efficient use of the land that way  and in that way  hopefully London will still have space to bury people in the near future. But  traditionally  cemeteries haven't been taken care of by the local authority. In fact  the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation on anyone in the UK to provide burial space. Traditionally  it's been done by private and religious organizations  like churches and mosques and synagogues. But there's also occasionally been a for profit group who has wanted to get in on the act. And  you know  they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost  and it looks like there's serious money to be made. So  actually  if you want to go out and start your own cemetery  you kind of can. There was this couple in South Wales  and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it  and they wanted to develop the land. They had a load of ideas. They first thought about making a caravan park  but the council said no. And then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no. Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this  they could increase the value of their land from about        pounds to over one million pounds. But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries  like  it's kind of ludicrous  right  The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading. They look like they're expensive  but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot    like  someone has to cut the grass for the next    years. That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries. And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not for profit group. But anyway  the council granted these people permission  and they're now trying to build their cemetery. So just to explain to you kind of how this works  If I want to build something in the UK  like a cemetery for example  then I have to apply for planning permission first. So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or  you know  if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office  I have to do a load of drawings  and I submit them to the council for permission. And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings. So they'll look at what it looks like. But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment  And they'll be thinking about things like  is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that I've built  But also good things. Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use  And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they'll make a decision. So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery. But what if I've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people  like five or six  Well  then    actually  I don't need permission from anyone  There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial  and the little bit that there is  is about not polluting water courses  like not polluting rivers or groundwater. So actually  if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery  then you can. But I mean  like    really  who does this  Right  Well  if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate  then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it  and you'll bury your family there. But the really weird thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you're allowed to start burying people on it. And so that means that  technically  this applies to  like  the back garden of your house in the suburbs. So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home  Well  there's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you. So  the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead    you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio. They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is. But that's pretty much it for formal requirements. Now  they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this  but  legally speaking  there's almost nothing that they can do about it. And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make  they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by    percent. Although  actually  it's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that. So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death. In the UK  and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar  only about    percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around death  and even for people over     only    percent of people have ever talked about this. And the reasons that people give ... you know  they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it. And you know  to a certain extent  there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us. The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death  for example  and there's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives to this issue. But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities  there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine. So we're not thinking about this  but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it    they're not taking care of it either. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  So I was thinking about female friendship a lot  and by the way  these two women  I'm very honored to say  have been my friends for a very long time  too. Jane Fonda  Yes we have. PM  And one of the things that I read about female friendship is something that Cervantes said. He said   You can tell a lot about someone   in this case a woman   by the company that she keeps.  So let's start with    JF  We're in big trouble. Lily Tomlin  Hand me one of those waters  I'm extremely dry. JF  You're taking up our time. We have a very limited    LT  Just being with her sucks the life out of me. JF  You ain't seen nothing yet. Anyway    sorry. PM  So tell me  what do you look for in a friend  LT  I look for someone who has a sense of fun  who's audacious  who's forthcoming  who has politics  who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet  someone who's decent  has a sense of justice and who thinks I'm worthwhile. JF  You know  I was thinking this morning  I don't even know what I would do without my women friends. I mean it's   I have my friends  therefore I am.  LT   Laughter  JF  No  it's true. I exist because I have my women friends. They    You're one of them. I don't know about you. But anyway    You know  they make me stronger  they make me smarter  they make me braver. They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course correcting. And most of them are a good deal younger than me  too. You know  I mean  it's nice    LT  Thank you. JF  No  I do  I include you in that  because listen  you know    it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end. I'm approaching    I'll be there sooner than you. LT  No  I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me. JF  I'm showing you the way. LT  Well  you are and you have. PM  Well  as we grow older  and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys  what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive  LT  Well you have to use a lot of    JF  She doesn't invite me over much  I'll tell you that. LT  I have to use a lot of social media    You be quiet now. And so    LT  And I look through my emails  I look through my texts to find my friends  so I can answer them as quickly as possible  because I know they need my counsel. They need my support  because most of my friends are writers  or activists  or actors  and you're all three ... and a long string of other descriptive phrases  and I want to get to you as soon as possible  I want you to know that I'm there for you. JF  Do you do emojis  LT  Oh ... JF  No  LT  That's embarrassing. JF  I'm really into emojis. LT  No  I spell out my    I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations  and sadness. JF  You spell it right out    LT  I spell it  every letter. JF  Such a purist. You know  as I've gotten older  I've understood more the importance of friendships  and so  I really make an effort to reach out and make play dates    not let too much time go by. I read a lot so  as Lily knows all too well  my books that I like  I send to my friends. LT  When we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women  female friendships  and I was so surprised to see how many books  how much research has been done recently    JF  And were you grateful  LT  I was grateful. PM  And    LT  Wait  no  it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked  put aside  marginalized. There's been very little research done on us  even though we volunteered lots of times. JF  That's for sure. LT  This is really exciting  and you all will be interested in this. The Harvard Medical School study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments    physical impairments as they age  and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital  exciting    JF  And longer    LT  Joyful lives. JF  We live five years longer than men. LT  I think I'd trade the years for joy. LT  But the most important part is they found    the results were so exciting and so conclusive    the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health  as much as smoking or being overweight. JF  And there's something else  too    LT  I've said my part  so ... JF  OK  well  listen to my part  because there's an additional thing. Because they only    for years  decades    they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress  only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed  and it turns out that when we're stressed    women  our bodies get flooded by oxytocin. Which is a feel good  calming  stress reducing hormone. Which is also increased when we're with our women friends. And I do think that's one reason why we live longer. And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that. Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin. LT  Well  when you and I and Dolly made    to    ... JF  Oh    LT  We laughed  we did  we laughed so much  we found we had so much in common and we're so different. Here she is  like Hollywood royalty  I'm like a tough kid from Detroit   Dolly's  a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee  and we found we were so in sync as women  and we must have    we laughed    we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans. JF  I think    we sure crossed our legs a lot. If you know what I mean. LT  I think we all know what you mean. PM  You're adding decades to our lives right now. So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly  Sister Joan Chittister  who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act  they're a spiritual act. Do you think of your friends as spiritual  Do they add something spiritual to your lives  LT  Spiritual    I absolutely think that. Because    especially people you've known a long time  people you've spent time with    I can see the spiritual essence inside them  the tenderness  the vulnerability. There's actually kind of a love  an element of love in the relationship. I just see deeply into your soul. PM  Do you think that  Jane    LT  But I have special powers. JF  Well  there's all kinds of friends. There's business friends  and party friends  I've got a lot of those. But the oxytocin producing friendships have ... They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening  right  You know  we go deep. And    I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends. Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them. LT  And you know one of you is going to go soon. PM  Well  two of us are sitting here  Lily  which one are you talking about  And I always think  when women talk about their friendships  that men always look a little mystified. What are the differences  in your opinion  between men friendships and women friendships  JF  There's a lot of difference  and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men    that they don't have what we have. Which I think may be why they die sooner. I have a lot of compassion for men  because women  no kidding  we    women's relationships  our friendships are full disclosure  we go deep. They're revelatory. We risk vulnerability    this is something men don't do. I mean how many times have I asked you   Am I doing OK    Did I really screw up there   PM  You're doing great. JF  But I mean  we ask questions like that of our women friends  and men don't. You know  people describe women's relationships as face to face  whereas men's friendships are more side by side. LT  I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions  they want to bury deeper feelings. I mean  that's the general  conventional thought. They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls  or talk about sports  or hunting  or cars or have sex. I mean  it's just the kind of    it's a more manly behavior. JF  You meant    LT  They talk about sex. I meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to    JF  You know something  though  that I find very interesting    and again  psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently    is that men are born every bit as relational as women are. If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls  you'll see the baby boys just like the girls  gazing into their mother's eyes  you know  needing that relational exchange of energy. When the mother looks away  they could see the dismay on the child  even the boy would cry. They need relationship. So the question is why  as they grow older  does that change  And the answer is patriarchal culture  which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship  to be emotional with someone is girly. That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need  they don't go to doctors if they feel bad. They don't ask for help. There's a quote that I really like   Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'.  You know  his sense of self. Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous. But our  we  is our saving grace  it's what makes us strong. It's not that we're better than men  we just don't have our masculinity to prove. LT  And  well    JF  That's a Gloria Steinem quote. So we can express our humanity    LT  I know who Gloria Steinem is. JF  I know you know who she is  but I think it's a    No  but it's a great quote  I think. We're not better than men  we just don't have our masculinity to prove. And that's really important. LT  But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy. And we've got to make something different happen. JF  Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power. LT  Well  that's what's exciting about this subject. It's because our friendships    female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood  and sisterhood can be a very powerful force  to give the world    to make it what it should be    the things that humans desperately need. PM  It is why we're talking about it  because women's friendships are  as you said  Jane  a renewable source of power. So how do we use that power  JF  Well  women are the fastest growing demographic in the world  especially older women. And if we harness our power  we can change the world. And guess what  We need to. And we need to do it soon. And one of the things that we need to do    and we can do it as women    for one thing  we kind of set the consumer standards. We need to consume less. We in the Western world need to consume less and when we buy things  we need to buy things that are made locally  when we buy food  we need to buy food that's grown locally. We are the ones that need to get off the grid. We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels. And the fossil fuel companies    the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys    cause they are    are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age. You know  that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet  and that's not true. There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine. And they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we're going to be back in the Stone Age  and in fact  if we begin to use renewable energy  and not drill in the Arctic  and not drill    LT  Oh  boy. JF  And not drill in the Alberta tar sands    Right. That we will be    there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well being  and it's women that are going to lead the way. LT  Maybe we have the momentum to start a third wave feminist movement with our sisterhood around the world  with women we don't see  women we may never meet  but we join together that way  because    Aristotle said    most people    people would die without male friendships. And the operative word here was  male.  Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal    JF  They didn't think we had souls even  the Greeks. LT  No  exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was. And wait  no  here's the best part. It's like  you know  men do need women now. The planet needs women. The US Constitution needs women. We are not even in the Constitution. JF  You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment. LT  Right. Justice Ginsberg said something like    every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature  but ours does not. So that would be a good place to start. Very  very mild    JF  Right. And gender equality  it's like a tide  it would lift all boats  not just women. PM  Needing new role models on how to do that. How to be friends  how to think about our power in different ways  as consumers  as citizens of the world  and this is what makes Jane and Lily a role model of how women can be friends    for a very long time  and even if they occasionally disagree. Thank you. Thank you both. JF  Thanks. LT  Thank you. JF  Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Commissioner  thank you for coming to TED. Ant nio Guterres  Pleasure. BG  Let's start with a figure. During       almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries  of course  from Syria and Iraq  but also from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere. And there have been reactions of two different kinds  welcoming parties and border fences. But I want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the long term perspective. And the first question is very simple  Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months  AG  Well  I think  basically  what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group. There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa  from Asia  but slowly growing  and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year. Why  I think there are three reasons  two long term ones and the trigger. The long term ones  in relation to Syrians  is that hope is less and less clear for people. I mean  they look at their own country and they don't see much hope to go back home  because there is no political solution  so there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Second  the living conditions of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating. We just had research with the World Bank  and    percent of the Syrians in Jordan and    percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines. Only half of the children go to school  which means that people are living very badly. Not only are they refugees  out of home  not only have they suffered what they have suffered  but they are living in very  very dramatic conditions. And then the trigger was when all of a sudden  international aid decreased. The World Food Programme was forced  for lack of resources  to cut by    percent food support to the Syrian refugees. They're not allowed to work  so they are totally dependent on international support  and they felt   The world is abandoning us.  And that  in my opinion  was the trigger. All of a sudden  there was a rush  and people started to move in large numbers and  to be absolutely honest  if I had been in the same situation and I would have been brave enough to do it  I think I would have done the same. BG  But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden  but it wasn't supposed to be sudden. The war in Syria has been happening for five years. Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria. You have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya  for example  and yet Europe looked totally unprepared. AG  Well  unprepared because divided  and when you are divided  you don't want to recognize the reality. You prefer to postpone decisions  because you do not have the capacity to make them. And the proof is that even when the spike occurred  Europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation. You talk about one million people. It looks enormous  but the population of the European Union is     million people  which means we are talking about one per every       Europeans. Now  in Lebanon  we have one refugee per three Lebanese. And Lebanon  Struggling  of course  but it's managing. So  the question is  is this something that could have been managed if    not mentioning the most important thing  which would have been addressing the root causes  but forgetting about root causes for now  looking at the phenomenon as it is    if Europe were able to come together in solidarity to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points  But for that  the countries at entry points need to be massively supported  and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms  distributing those that are coming into all European countries  according to the possibilities of each country. I mean  if you look at the relocation program that was approved by the Commission  always too little too late  or by the Council  too little too late    BG  It's already breaking down. AG  My country is supposed to receive four thousand. Four thousand in Portugal means nothing. So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed  but in the present circumstances  the pressure is at the point of entry  and then  as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans  then they come to Germany  Sweden  basically  and Austria. They are the three countries that are  in the end  receiving the refugees. The rest of Europe is looking without doing much. BG  Let me try to bring up three questions  playing a bit devil's advocate. I'll try to ask them  make them blunt. But I think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in Europe right now  The first  of course  is about numbers. You say     million versus one million is not much  but realistically  how many people can Europe take  AG  Well  that is a question that has no answer  because refugees have the right to be protected. And there is such a thing as international law  so there is no way you can say   I take        and that's finished.  I remind you of one thing  in Turkey  at the beginning of the crisis  I remember one minister saying   Turkey will be able to receive up to         people.  Turkey has now two million three hundred thousand or something of the sort  if you count all refugees. So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take. What it is fair to say is  how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities  And Europe has not been able to do so  because basically  Europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the European project. And it's not only about refugees  there are many other areas. And let's be honest  this is the moment in which we need more Europe instead of less Europe. But as the public less and less believes in European institutions  it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more Europe to solve these problems. BG  We seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts  particularly domestically. We saw it again this weekend in France  but we have seen it over and over in many countries  in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere  where the mood changes radically because of the numbers  although they are not very significant in absolute numbers. The Prime Minister of    AG  But  if I may  on these  I mean  what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants  What a European sees is  on television  every single day  a few months ago  opening the news every single day  a crowd coming  uncontrolled  moving from border to border  and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving. And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it    this is happening without any kind of management. And so their idea was   They are coming to my village.  So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change  and everything will    And the problem is that if this had been properly managed  if people had been properly received  welcomed  sheltered at point of entry  screened at point of entry  and the moved by plane to different European countries  this would not have scared people. But  unfortunately  we have a lot of people scared  just because Europe was not able to do the job properly. BG  But there are villages in Germany with     inhabitants and       refugees. So  what's your position  How do you imagine these people reacting  AG  If there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over Europe  you would always have the percentage that I mentioned  one per each      . It is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally impossible to live with  and of course if you have a village    in Lebanon  there are many villages that have more Syrians than Lebanese  Lebanon has been living with that. I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe  for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants. What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly  and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past. BG  So  if you look at the global situation not only at Europe    BG  Yes  BG  If you look at the global situation  so  not only at Europe  I know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up  but I'm more interested in the other part    is there somebody who's doing the right thing  AG  Well     percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world. And if you look at countries like Ethiopia    Ethiopia has received more than         refugees. All the borders in Ethiopia are open. And they have  as a policy  they call the  people to people  policy that every refugee should be received. And they have South Sudanese  they have Sudanese  they have Somalis. They have all the neighbors. They have Eritreans. And  in general  African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming  and I would say that in the Middle East and in Asia  we have seen a tendency for borders to be open. Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation  as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis  but the truth is that for a large period  all borders in the Middle East were open. The truth is that for Afghans  the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for  at the time  six million Afghans that came. So I would say that even today  the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open. The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become more and more complex  especially when there is  in the public opinion  a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions    in my opinion  misinterpreted    on the other side. BG  We'll come back to that too  but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the World Food Programme. That reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues. Now that the world seems to have woken up  are you getting more funding and more support  or it's still the same  AG  We are getting more support. I would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year. We were much worse during the summer. But that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people. And here we have a basic review of the criteria  the objectives  the priorities of development cooperation that is required. For instance  Lebanon and Jordan are middle income countries. Because they are middle income countries  they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank. Now  today this doesn't make any sense  because they are providing a global public good. They have millions of refugees there  and to be honest  they are pillars of stability in the region  with all the difficulties they face  and the first line of defense of our collective security. So it doesn't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies. And they are not. And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries  but the local communities themselves are suffering  because salaries went down  because there are more unemployed  because prices and rents went up. And  of course  if you look at today's situation of the indicators in these countries  it is clear that  especially their poor groups of the population  are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing. BG  Who should be providing this support  Country by country  international organizations  the European Union  Who should be coming up with this support  AG  We need to join all efforts. It's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest more massively in support to these countries. We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today  in protracted situations  at a certain moment  that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid or development processes. Because you are talking about children in school  you are talking about health  you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded. You are talking about things that require a long term perspective  a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective. BG  I would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning. It is a statement made by the current front runner for the Republican nomination for US President  Donald Trump. Yesterday  he said this. No  listen to this. It's interesting. I quote   I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US  until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on.  How do you react to that  AG  Well  it's not only Donald Trump. We have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying  for instance  that Muslims refugees should not be received. And the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this  they are protecting the security of their countries. Now  I've been in government. I am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security of their countries and their people. But if you say  like that  in the US or in any European country   We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees   what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations. Because what you are saying    What you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country  and it will pave the way for the recruitment and the mechanisms that  through technology  Daesh and al Nusra  al Qaeda  and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies. And it's just telling them   You are right  we are against you.  So obviously  this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic  multi religious  multicultural  this is creating a situation in which  really  it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed. BG  Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult  AG  Undoubtedly. BG  In what sense  AG  In the sense that  I mean  for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is  close all borders    not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown. We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq  so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in. And I must say  I am convinced that the passport that appeared  I believe  was put by the person who has blown    BG     himself up  yeah. AG   I believe  it was on purpose  because part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees  because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders. And I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react  closing its doors to Muslim refugees and having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe  exactly to facilitate Daesh's work. And my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism. I think  as I said  essentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing  and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong  by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world. And another thing that I believe is that to a large extent  what we are today paying for in Europe is the failures of integration models that didn't work in the '  s  in the '  s  in the '  s  in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people  for instance  of the second generation of communities  a situation of feeling marginalized  having no jobs  having improper education  living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure. And this kind of uneasiness  sometimes even anger  that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies  to the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other. For me it is clear. For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic  multicultural  multi religious in the future. To try to avoid it is  in my opinion  impossible. And for me it's a good thing that they will be like that  but I also recognize that  for that to work properly  you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies. And Europe  to a large extent  failed in that investment in the past few decades. BG  Question  You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year  after    years. If you look back at       when you entered that office for the first time  what do you see  AG  Well  look  In       we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity  because conflicts had ended. Last year  we helped        . In       we had about    million people displaced by conflict in the world. Today  we have more than    million. At that time  we had had  recently  some conflicts that were solved. Now  we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died  Afghanistan  Somalia  Democratic Republic of Congo. It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was. It is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them  is  unfortunately  much worse than what it was    years ago. There are no clear power relations in the world  no global governance mechanisms that work  which means that we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail  and that means that more and more people suffer  namely those that are displaced by conflicts. BG  It's a tradition in American politics that when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time  he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later. If you had to write such a note to your successor  Filippo Grandi  what would you write  AG  Well  I don't think I would write any message. You know  one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver  always telling the new one what to do. So that  I will not do. If I had to say something to him  it would be   Be yourself  and do your best.  BG  Commissioner  thank you for the job you do. Thank you for coming to TED. In       Burhan Hassan  age     boarded a flight from Minneapolis to the Horn of Africa. And while Burhan was the youngest recruit  he was not alone. Al Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men in their late teens and early   s with a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook. With the Internet and other technologies  they've changed our everyday lives  but they've also changed recruitment  radicalization and the front lines of conflict today. What about the links connecting Twitter  Google and protesters fighting for democracy  These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers  effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other  to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening in their own country. Today  conflict is essentially borderless. If there are bounds to conflict today  they're bound by digital  not physical geography. And under all this is a vacuum of power where non state actors  individuals and private organizations have the advantage over slow  outdated military and intelligence agencies. And this is because  in the digital age of conflict  there exists a feedback loop where new technologies  platforms like the ones I mentioned  and more disruptive ones  can be adapted  learned  and deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react. To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this  I like to turn to something aptly named the Worldwide Threat Assessment  where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US looks at the global threat landscape  and he says   These are the threats  these are the details  and this is how we rank them.  In       there was absolutely no mention of cyber security. It took until       when it came at the end  where other things  like West African drug trafficking  took precedence. In       it crept up  still behind things like terrorism and proliferation. In       it became the top threat  in      and for the foreseeable future. What things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict  where conflict can be immaterial  borderless  often wholly untraceable. And conflict isn't just online to offline  as we see with terrorist radicalization  but it goes the other way as well. We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.  JeSuisCharlie. On Facebook  on Twitter  on Google  all sorts of places where millions of people  myself included  were talking about the events and saw images like this  the emotional  poignant image of a baby with  Je suis Charlie  on its wrist. And this turned into a weapon. What the hackers did was weaponize this image  where unsuspecting victims  like all of us in those conversations  saw this image  downloaded it but it was embedded with malware. And so when you downloaded this image  it hacked your system. It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign. The divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist  where we have offline attacks like those in Paris appropriated for online hacks. And it goes the other way as well  with recruitment. We see online radicalization of teens  who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks. With all of this  we see that there's a new   st century battle brewing  and governments don't necessarily take a part. So in another case  Anonymous vs. Los Zetas. In early September      in Mexico  Los Zetas  one of the most powerful drug cartels  hung two bloggers with a sign that said   This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies.  A week later  they beheaded a young girl. They severed her head  put it on top of her computer with a similar note. And taking the digital counteroffensive because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act  Anonymous  a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world  took action  not in cyber attacks  but threatening information to be free. On social media  they said   We will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel.  And escalating that conflict  Los Zetas said   We will kill    people for every bit of information you release.  And so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue. But what was powerful about this was that anonymous individuals  not federal policia  not military  not politicians  could strike fear deep into the heart of one of the most powerful  violent organizations in the world. And so we live in an era that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict  in who we're fighting  in the motivations behind attacks  in the tools and techniques used  and how quickly they evolve. And the question still remains  what can individuals  organizations and governments do  For answers to these questions  it starts with individuals  and I think peer to peer security is the answer. Those people in relationships that bought over teens online  we can do that with peer to peer security. Individuals have more power than ever before to affect national and international security. And we can create those positive peer to peer relationships on and offline  we can support and educate the next generation of hackers  like myself  instead of saying   You can either be a criminal or join the NSA.  That matters today. And it's not just individuals    it's organizations  corporations even. They have an advantage to act across more borders  more effectively and more rapidly than governments can  and there's a set of real incentives there. It's profitable and valuable to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age  and will only be more so in future generations to come. But we still can't ignore government  because that's who we turn to for collective action to keep us safe and secure. But we see where that's gotten us so far  where there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict  where at the highest levels of leadership  the Director of the CIA  Secretary of Defense  they say   Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen.   Cyber      is imminent.  But this only makes us more fearful  not more secure. By banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking  sure  GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you. But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can. Capabilities are cheap  even free. Technical ability is rising around the world  and individuals and small groups have the advantage. So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ  but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor  Or in another generation  some kid in his basement in Estonia  And so I would say that it's not what governments can do  it's that they can't. Governments today need to give up power and control in order to help make us more secure. Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that  yeah  they can't spy on us  but neither can the Chinese or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now. And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin mean giving up control  but it means that developers  translators  anybody with an Internet connection  in countries like Cuba  Iran and China  can sell their skills  their products  in the global marketplace  but more importantly sell their ideas  show us what's happening in their own countries. And so it should be not fearful  it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights  free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century  that today  for the first time in human history  we have a technical opportunity to make billions of people safer around the world that we've never had before in human history. It should be inspiring. Ten years ago  I had my first exhibition here. I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible  but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve  I made my first sculpture  called  The Lost Correspondent.  Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center  I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada  in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan. And then this incredible thing happened. It transformed. One sculpture became two. Two quickly became   . And before I knew it  we had the world's first underwater sculpture park. In       I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman. This grew to a small community  to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea. And then finally  to an underwater museum  with over     living sculptures. Gardening  it seems  is not just for greenhouses. We've since scaled up the designs   Ocean Atlas   in the Bahamas  rising    feet up to the surface and weighing over    tons  to now currently in Lanzarote  where I'm making an underwater botanical garden  the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean. Each project  we use materials and designs that help encourage life  a long lasting pH neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform. It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach. We position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning  there's areas for them to settle. The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale. Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins. So why exhibit my work in the ocean  Because honestly  it's really not easy. When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred foot crane  trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor  you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead. But in the end  the results always blow my mind. The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for. You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour  explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery  a unique timeless quality and the procession of inquisitive visitors  each lending their own special touch to the site. But over the years  I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do  the really humbling thing about the work  is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures  they're not ours anymore  because as soon as we sink them  the sculptures  they belong to the sea. As new reefs form  a new world literally starts to evolve  a world that continuously amazes me. It's a bit of a clich   but nothing man made can ever match the imagination of nature. Sponges look like veins across the faces. Staghorn coral morphs the form. Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed. Tunicates explode from the faces. Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night. Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint. The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater. Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves. Purple sponges breathe water like air. And grey angelfish glide silently overhead. And the amazing response we've had to these works tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal  because it seems that these images translate across the world  and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what I'm trying to achieve. I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean  and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really  really important effect of my work. Because as we all know  our reefs are dying  and our oceans are in trouble. So here's the thing  the most used  searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this. And I think this is for a reason  or at least I hope it is. What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature  that we need to start thinking about our oceans  too. Since building these sites  we've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results. Besides creating over     square meters of new habitats and living reef  visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs  providing significant rest for natural  overstressed areas. Visitors to  Ocean Atlas  in the Bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery. The subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge    million dollars in coastal cleanups. The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot    a marine protected area. Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas. The site was actually listed as a  Wonder of the World  by National Geographic. So why are we all here today in this room  What do we all have in common  I think we all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough. And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred  and we should. When we see incredible places    like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Fam lia  or the Mona Lisa  even    when we see these incredible places and things  we understand their importance. We call them sacred  and we do our best to cherish them  to protect them and to keep them safe. But in order to do that  we are the ones that have to assign that value  otherwise  it will be desecrated by someone who doesn't understand that value. So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things. When we were naming the site in Cancun  we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason  museums are places of preservation  of conservation and of education. They're places where we keep objects of great value to us  where we simply treasure them for them being themselves. If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel  we'd all go crazy. If someone wanted to build a seven star hotel at the bottom of the Grand Canyon  then we would laugh them out of Arizona. Yet every day we dredge  pollute and overfish our oceans. And I think it's easier for us to do that  because when we see the ocean  we don't see the havoc we're wreaking. Because for most people  the ocean is like this. And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous  as fragile. It's simply too massive  too vast  too endless. And what do you see here  I think most people actually look past to the horizon. So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea  and if we don't really see it  if it doesn't have its own iconography  if we miss its majesty  then there's a big danger that we take it for granted. Cancun is famous for spring break  tequila and foam parties. And its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis and banana boats. But because of our work there  there's now a little corner of Cancun that is simply precious for being itself. And we don't want to stop in Grenada  in Cancun or the Bahamas. Just last month  I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Thames River  in central London  right in front of the Houses of Parliament  putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things. Because for me  this is just the beginning of the mission. We want to team up with other inventors  creators  philanthropists  educators  biologists  to see better futures for our oceans. And we want to see beyond sculpture  beyond art  even. Say you're a    year old kid from the city  and you've never seen the ocean. And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium  you get taken out to the ocean  to an underwater Noah's Ark  which you can access through a dry glass viewing tunnel  where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean. Clearly  it would blow your mind. So let's think big and let's think deep. Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us  I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean  that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting  but that we are also giving something back  and by encouraging new environments to thrive  and in some way opening up a new    or maybe it's a really old way of seeing the seas  as delicate  precious places  worthy of our protection. Our oceans are sacred. Thank you. What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life  If you were going to invest now in your future best self  where would you put your time and your energy  There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were  and over    percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. And another    percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. And we're constantly told to lean in to work  to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives  of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them  those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past  and as we know  hindsight is anything but      . We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life  and sometimes memory is downright creative. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time  What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy  We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For    years  we've tracked the lives of     men  year after year  asking about their work  their home lives  their health  and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study  or funding for the research dries up  or the researchers get distracted  or they die  and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers  this study has survived. About    of our original     men are still alive  still participating in the study  most of them in their   s. And we are now beginning to study the more than       children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since       we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II  and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods  boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the     s. Most lived in tenements  many without hot and cold running water. When they entered the study  all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors  one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top  and some made that journey in the opposite direction. The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today     years later  telling you that the study still continues. Every two years  our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. Many of the inner city Boston men ask us   Why do you keep wanting to study me  My life just isn't that interesting.  The Harvard men never ask that question. To get the clearest picture of these lives  we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood  we scan their brains  we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when  about a decade ago  we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study  many of the women said   You know  it's about time.  So what have we learned  What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives  Well  the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this    year study is this  Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period. We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us  and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family  to friends  to community  are happier  they're physically healthier  and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy  their health declines earlier in midlife  their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time  more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage  so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have  and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship  but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High conflict marriages  for example  without much affection  turn out to be very bad for our health  perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good  warm relationships is protective. Once we had followed our men all the way into their   s  we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy  healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age     it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age    were the healthiest at age   . And good  close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported  in their   s  that on the days when they had more physical pain  their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships  on the days when they reported more physical pain  it was magnified by more emotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies  they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your   s is protective  that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need  those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one  those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships  they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out  but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough  those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. So this message  that good  close relationships are good for our health and well being  this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore  Well  we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix  something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends  it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our    year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey  many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over  over these    years  our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships  with family  with friends  with community. So what about you  Let's say you're     or you're     or you're   . What might leaning in to relationships even look like  Well  the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together  long walks or date nights  or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years  because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago  he was looking back on his life  and he wrote this   There isn't time  so brief is life  for bickerings  apologies  heartburnings  callings to account. There is only time for loving  and but an instant  so to speak  for that.  The good life is built with good relationships. Thank you. A hundred years ago this month  a    year old Albert Einstein stood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin to present a radical new theory of space  time and gravity  the general theory of relativity. General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece  a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales  capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.      must have been an exciting year to be a physicist. Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head. One was Einstein's theory of relativity  the other was arguably even more revolutionary  quantum mechanics  a mind meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld  the world of atoms and particles. Over the last century  these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe. It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from  how it began and how it continues to evolve. A hundred years on  we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics  but what's at stake now is rather different. The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature  or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science  we could be facing questions that we cannot answer  not because we don't have the brains or technology  but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it. This is the essential problem  the universe is far  far too interesting. Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place. It should be dark  lethal and lifeless. But when we look around us  we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff  full of stars  planets  trees  squirrels. The question is  ultimately  why does all this interesting stuff exist  Why is there something rather than nothing  This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics  and in the next few years  we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it. At the heart of this problem are two numbers  two extremely dangerous numbers. These are properties of the universe that we can measure  and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different  even by a tiny bit  then the universe as we know it would not exist. The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall  at CERN  home of this machine  the largest scientific device ever built by the human race  the Large Hadron Collider. The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a    kilometer ring  getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors. On July          physicists at CERN announced to the world that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC  the Higgs boson. Now  if you followed the news at the time  you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed  and you'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle. Well  that is kind of true  but the Higgs boson is particularly special. We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field. Now  you may have trouble imagining an energy field  but we've all experienced one. If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap  then you've felt the effect of a field. And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field  except it has a constant value everywhere. It's all around us right now. We can't see it or touch it  but if it wasn't there  we would not exist. The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from. If it wasn't there  those particles would have no mass  and no atoms could form and there would be no us. But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field. Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings  a bit like a light switch. It should either be off  so that it has a zero value everywhere in space  or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value. In both of these scenarios  atoms could not exist  and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist. In reality  the Higgs field is just slightly on  not zero but        trillion times weaker than its fully on value  a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position. And this value is crucial. If it were a tiny bit different  then there would be no physical structure in the universe. So this is the first of our dangerous numbers  the strength of the Higgs field. Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine tuned number  and they've come up with a number of possible explanations. They have sexy sounding names like  supersymmetry  or  large extra dimensions.  I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now  but the key point is this  if any of them explained this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field  then we should see new particles being created at the LHC along with the Higgs boson. So far  though  we've not seen any sign of them. But there's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine tuning of a dangerous number  and this time it comes from the other end of the scale  from studying the universe at vast distances. One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time   .  billion years ago  the Big Bang. Now  according to early versions of the Big Bang theory  the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion. But in       astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy. Now  whenever you hear the word  dark  in physics  you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about. We don't know what dark energy is  but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself  the energy of the vacuum. Now  if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out how strong dark energy should be  you get an absolutely astonishing result. You find that dark energy should be    to the power of     times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy. That's one with     zeroes after it. This is a number so mind bogglingly huge that it's impossible to get your head around. We often use the word  astronomical  when we're talking about big numbers. Well  even that one won't do here. This number is bigger than any number in astronomy. It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe. So that's a pretty bad prediction. In fact  it's been called the worst prediction in physics  and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity. If dark energy were anywhere near this strong  then the universe would have been torn apart  stars and galaxies could not form  and we would not be here. So this is the second of those dangerous numbers  the strength of dark energy  and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine tuning than we saw for the Higgs field. But unlike the Higgs field  this number has no known explanation. The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity  which is the theory of the universe at grand scales  with quantum mechanics  the theory of the universe at small scales  might provide a solution. Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics  and physicists have kept at it ever since. One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory  and the essential idea is  if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world  you'd see actually that they're not particles at all  but tiny vibrating strings of energy  with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle  a bit like musical notes on a guitar string. So it's a rather elegant  almost poetic way of looking at the world  but it has one catastrophic problem. It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all  but a whole collection of theories. It's been estimated  in fact  that there are    to the     different versions of string theory. Each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics. Now  critics say this makes string theory unscientific. You can't disprove the theory. But others actually turned this on its head and said  well  maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph. What if all of these    to the     different possible universes actually exist out there somewhere in some grand multiverse  Suddenly we can understand the weirdly fine tuned values of these two dangerous numbers. In most of the multiverse  dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart  or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form. We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right. We live in a Goldilocks universe. Now  this idea is extremely controversial  and it's easy to see why. If we follow this line of thinking  then we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   In most of the multiverse  there is nothing  and we live in one of the few places where the laws of physics allow there to be something. Even worse  we can't test the idea of the multiverse. We can't access these other universes  so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not. So we're in an extremely frustrating position. That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist. There are other planets  other stars  other galaxies  so why not other universes  The problem is  it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. Now  the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while  but in the last few years  we've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out. Despite high hopes for the first run of the LHC  what we were looking for there    we were looking for new theories of physics  supersymmetry or large extra dimensions that could explain this weirdly fine tuned value of the Higgs field. But despite high hopes  the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely Higgs boson. My experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics. The stakes now could not be higher. This summer  the LHC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run. What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles  micro black holes  or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. If so  then we can continue this long journey that began     years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature. But if  in two or three years' time  when the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown  we've found nothing but the Higgs boson  then we may be entering a new era in physics  an era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain  an era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse that lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach  an era where we will never be able to answer the question   Why is there something rather than nothing   Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Harry  even if you just said the science may not have some answers  I would like to ask you a couple of questions  and the first is  building something like the LHC is a generational project. I just mentioned  introducing you  that we live in a short term world. How do you think so long term  projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this  Harry Cliff  I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in       just as we were switching on  and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades  their entire careers on one machine. So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in       and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it. So the computing power did not exist in the early '  s when design work began in earnest. One of the big detectors which record these collisions  they didn't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC  so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside  but subsequently we have developed technology. So you have to rely on people's ingenuity  that they will solve the problems  but it may be a decade or more down the line. BG  China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC. I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news. HC  Size isn't everything  Bruno. BG  I'm sure. I'm sure. It sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that. But I mean  seriously  it's great news. So building a machine like the LHC requires countries from all over the world to pool their resources. No one nation can afford to build a machine this large  apart from maybe China  because they can mobilize huge amounts of resources  manpower and money to build machines like this. So it's only a good thing. What they're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas  like supersymmetry  are really out there  so it's great news for physics  I think. BG  Harry  thank you. HC  Thank you very much. Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about  even though he may have been responsible for    somewhat mediocre  minutes of your life on April         . He may have also been responsible for    very entertaining minutes  but not very many of you. And all of that goes back to a decision that Roy had to make about three years ago. So you see  Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios. That's the TV production company of Amazon. He's    years old  slim  spiky hair  describes himself on Twitter as  movies  TV  technology  tacos.  And Roy Price has a very responsible job  because it's his responsibility to pick the shows  the original content that Amazon is going to make. And of course that's a highly competitive space. I mean  there are so many TV shows already out there  that Roy can't just choose any show. He has to find shows that are really  really great. So in other words  he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here. So this curve here is the rating distribution of about       TV shows on the website IMDB  and the rating goes from one to     and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating. So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher  that's a winner. Then you have a top two percent show. That's shows like  Breaking Bad    Game of Thrones    The Wire   so all of these shows that are addictive  whereafter you've watched a season  your brain is basically like   Where can I get more of these episodes   That kind of show. On the left side  just for clarity  here on that end  you have a show called  Toddlers and Tiaras        which should tell you enough about what's going on on that end of the curve. Now  Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve  because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut  Toddlers and Tiaras.  So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here  the bulge of average TV  you know  those shows that aren't really good or really bad  they don't really get you excited. So he needs to make sure that he's really on the right end of this. So the pressure is on  and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this  so Roy Price does not want to take any chances. He wants to engineer success. He needs a guaranteed success  and so what he does is  he holds a competition. So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows  and from those ideas  through an evaluation  they select eight candidates for TV shows  and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch. And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff  you're going to take it  right  So millions of viewers are watching those episodes. What they don't realize is that  while they're watching their shows  actually  they are being watched. They are being watched by Roy Price and his team  who record everything. They record when somebody presses play  when somebody presses pause  what parts they skip  what parts they watch again. So they collect millions of data points  because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make. And sure enough  so they collect all the data  they do all the data crunching  and an answer emerges  and the answer is   Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators.  They did that show. So does anyone know the name of the show  Yes   Alpha House   but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show  actually  because it didn't turn out that great. It's actually just an average show  actually    literally  in fact  because the average of this curve here is at  .   and  Alpha House  lands at  .   so a slightly above average show  but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for. Meanwhile  however  at about the same time  at another company  another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis  and his name is Ted  Ted Sarandos  who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix  and just like Roy  he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show  and he uses data as well to do that  except he does it a little bit differently. So instead of holding a competition  what he did    and his team of course    was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers  you know  the ratings they give their shows  the viewing histories  what shows people like  and so on. And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience  what kinds of shows they like  what kind of producers  what kind of actors. And once they had all of these pieces together  they took a leap of faith  and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator. You guys know the show  Yes   House of Cards   and Netflix of course  nailed it with that show  at least for the first two seasons.  House of Cards  gets a  .  rating on this curve  so it's exactly where they wanted it to be. Now  the question of course is  what happened here  So you have two very competitive  data savvy companies. They connect all of these millions of data points  and then it works beautifully for one of them  and it doesn't work for the other one. So why  Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time. I mean  if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make  then you should be able to make a pretty good decision. You have     years of statistics to rely on. You're amplifying it with very powerful computers. The least you could expect is good TV  right  And if data analysis does not work that way  then it actually gets a little scary  because we live in a time where we're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV. Does anyone here know the company Multi Health Systems  No one. OK  that's good actually. OK  so Multi Health Systems is a software company  and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software  because if you do  it means you're in prison. If someone here in the US is in prison  and they apply for parole  then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole. So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix  but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad  you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad. And mediocre TV     minutes  that can be pretty bad  but more years in prison  I guess  even worse. And unfortunately  there is actually some evidence that this data analysis  despite having lots of data  does not always produce optimum results. And that's not because a company like Multi Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data. Even the most data savvy companies get it wrong. Yes  even Google gets it wrong sometimes. In       Google announced that they were able  with data analysis  to predict outbreaks of influenza  the nasty kind of flu  by doing data analysis on their Google searches. And it worked beautifully  and it made a big splash in the news  including the pinnacle of scientific success  a publication in the journal  Nature.  It worked beautifully for year after year after year  until one year it failed. And nobody could even tell exactly why. It just didn't work that year  and of course that again made big news  including now a retraction of a publication from the journal  Nature.  So even the most data savvy companies  Amazon and Google  they sometimes get it wrong. And despite all those failures  data is moving rapidly into real life decision making    into the workplace  law enforcement  medicine. So we should better make sure that data is helping. Now  personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself  because I work in computational genetics  which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug. And over the years  I've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule  if you will  about the difference between successful decision making with data and unsuccessful decision making  and I find this a pattern worth sharing  and it goes something like this. So whenever you're solving a complex problem  you're doing essentially two things. The first one is  you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces  and then of course you do the second part. You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion. And sometimes you have to do it over again  but it's always those two things  taking apart and putting back together again. And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part. Data and data analysis  no matter how powerful  can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces. It's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion. There's another tool that can do that  and we all have it  and that tool is the brain. If there's one thing a brain is good at  it's taking bits and pieces back together again  even when you have incomplete information  and coming to a good conclusion  especially if it's the brain of an expert. And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful  because they used data and brains where they belong in the process. They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth  but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like  House of Cards   that was nowhere in the data. Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show  which also meant  by the way  that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision. And Amazon  on the other hand  they did it the wrong way around. They used data all the way to drive their decision making  first when they held their competition of TV ideas  then when they selected  Alpha House  to make as a show. Which of course was a very safe decision for them  because they could always point at the data  saying   This is what the data tells us.  But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for. So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions  but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions. No matter how powerful  data is just a tool  and to keep that in mind  I find this device here quite useful. Many of you will ... Before there was data  this was the decision making device to use. Many of you will know this. This toy here is called the Magic   Ball  and it's really amazing  because if you have a decision to make  a yes or no question  all you have to do is you shake the ball  and then you get an answer     Most Likely     right here in this window in real time. I'll have it out later for tech demos. Now  the thing is  of course    so I've made some decisions in my life where  in hindsight  I should have just listened to the ball. But  you know  of course  if you have the data available  you want to replace this with something much more sophisticated  like data analysis to come to a better decision. But that does not change the basic setup. So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter  but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary  on the right end of the curve. And I find that a very encouraging message  in fact  that even in the face of huge amounts of data  it still pays off to make decisions  to be an expert in what you're doing and take risks. Because in the end  it's not data  it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve. Thank you. I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. But I know that it's there. And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. On our planet  where there's water  there's life. So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. At this distance  shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures  planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. What I do picks up where their job ends. I model the possible climates of exoplanets. And here's why that's important  there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. Take the planet Venus. It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty  because of its benign  ethereal appearance in the sky. But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. The surface temperature is close to     degrees Fahrenheit      Celsius. That's hot enough to melt lead. Its thick atmosphere  not its distance from the sun  is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids  trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. From these lessons from our own solar system  we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. For example  one of the closest planets that could support surface water    it's called Gliese     Cc    such a glamorous name  right  nice phone number for a name    it's    light years away. So that's more than     trillion miles. Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. OK  now imagine that car is     trillion miles away  and you want to know the precise color of that fly. So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler   f  with the Earth for reference. It's       light years away  and just    percent larger than Earth. Our NSF funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. Ice absorbs longer  redder wavelengths of light  and reflects shorter  bluer light. That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. There's another contradiction    that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars  and that light  that energy  heats the ice. Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. I'm an African American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines  so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature    ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. My organization  Rising Stargirls  teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color  using theater  writing and visual art. That's another contradiction    science and art don't often go together  but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn  and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions  and use their backgrounds to discover  once and for all  that we are truly not alone in the universe. Thank you. Our grandparents' generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it possible for people to live in places where there wasn't a lot of water. For example  during the Great Depression  they created the Hoover Dam  which in turn  created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place. In the   th century  we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities. In terms of economic development  it was a great investment. But in the last decade  we've seen the combined effects of climate change  population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources. This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last    years. You can see starting around the year       the lake level started to drop. And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry. The city became so concerned about this that they recently constructed a new drinking water intake structure that they referred to as the  Third Straw  to pull water out of the greater depths of the lake. The challenges associated with providing water to a modern city are not restricted to the American Southwest. In the year       the third largest city in Australia  Brisbane  came within   months of running out of water. A similar drama is playing out today in S o Paulo  Brazil  where the main reservoir for the city has gone from being completely full in       to being nearly empty today as the city approaches the      Summer Olympics. For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the world's great cities  we've never truly experienced the effects of a catastrophic drought. We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take. We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns. But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out. And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past  it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells. Well  in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for  it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water. Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors. But that's an approach that's fraught with political  legal and social dangers. And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors  we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water. I think that there's a better way to solve our urban water crisis and I think that's to open up four new local sources of water that I liken to faucets. If we can make smart investments in these new sources of water in the coming years  we can solve our urban water problem and decrease the likelihood that we'll ever run across the effects of a catastrophic drought. Now  if you told me    years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water  I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer. But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water  and that's what I want to tell you about tonight. The first source of local water supply that we need to develop to solve our urban water problem will flow with the rainwater that falls in our cities. One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew  we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt. And when we did that  we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding  and that's a waste of a vital water resource. Let me give you an example. This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits. You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city  they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year. Now  I know what some of you are probably thinking.  The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters  rainwater harvesting.  Now  that's an idea that might work in some places. But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime  it's not a very cost effective way to solve a water problem. And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought  like California's currently experiencing  you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem. I think there's a lot more practical way to harvest the stormwater and the rainwater that falls in our cities  and that's to capture it and let it percolate into the ground. After all  many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water. For example  historically  Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley. Now  when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter  you might say to yourself   Do I really want to drink that stuff   Well  the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit. And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water  clean the water and get it underground. And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank  California. This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems  or storm sewers  and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry. The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man made wetland  and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground  recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city. And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground  the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil  and that purifies the water. And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process  the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink. The second tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with the wastewater that comes out of our sewage treatment plants. Now  many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water. You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant. We've been doing this for a couple of decades now. But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be. Because once we build the first few water recycling systems close to the sewage treatment plant  we have to build longer and longer pipe networks to get that water to where it needs to go. And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost. What we're finding is that a much more cost effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two step process. In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane  a thin  permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts  the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater. In the second step in the process  we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water. The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals  and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals. After the water's been through this two stage process  it's safe to drink. I know  I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past    years. We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process  but by the time we get to the second step  the advanced oxidation process  we rarely see any chemicals present. And that's in stark contrast to the taken for granted water supplies that we regularly drink all the time. There's another way we can recycle water. This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California. The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino. The water comes into our treatment wetland  it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals  remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens. The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River  it flows down to Anaheim  gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground  and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim  completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County. Now  you might think that this idea of drinking wastewater is some sort of futuristic fantasy or not commonly done. Well  in California  we already recycle about    billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about. That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply. The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all  it will be a kind of virtual tap  it will be the water conservation that we manage to do. And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities  about half of our water use happens outdoors. In the current drought  we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water. So there's no need to start painting concrete green and putting in Astroturf and buying cactuses. We can have California friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities. The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater. Now  I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination.  It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil  not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change.  Seawater desalination is energy intensive no matter how you slice it. But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date. We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades. This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego. Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara    years ago  this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water. But just because seawater desalination has become less energy intensive  doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere. Among the different choices we have  it's probably the most energy intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply. So there it is. With these four sources of water  we can move away from our reliance on imported water. Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties  we can reduce outdoor water use by about    percent  thereby increasing  the water supply by    percent. We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer  thereby increasing our water supply by    percent. And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination. So  let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years. Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food. Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values. And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system. Thank you very much for your attention. A few years ago  I got one of those spam emails. And it managed to get through my spam filter. I'm not quite sure how  but it turned up in my inbox  and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. I know. It went like this  it said   Hello James Veitch  I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you  Solomon.  Now  my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button  right  I was looking at my phone. I thought  I could just delete this. Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. And I said   Solomon  Your email intrigues me.  And the game was afoot. He said   Dear James Veitch  We shall be shipping Gold to you.   You will earn     of any gold you distributes.  So I knew I was dealing with a professional. I said   How much is it worth   He said   We will start with smaller quantity      I was like  aww    and then he said   of    kgs. The worth should be about   .  million.  I said   Solomon  if we're going to do it  let's go big. I can handle it. How much gold do you have   He said   It is not a matter of how much gold I have  what matters is your capability of handling. We can start with    kgs as trial shipment.  I said      kgs  There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton.  He said   What do you do for a living   I said   I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager.  This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion  my friend  no no no. Then I started to panic. I was like   Where are you based   I don't know about you  but I think if we're going via the postal service  it ought to be signed for. That's a lot of gold.  He said   It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment.  I said   Solomon  I'm completely with you on this one. I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. Hold tight.  This is what I sent Solomon. I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house  but there's definitely something going on. I said   Solomon  attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible.  There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings  and this was it for Solomon. He said   I will be so much happy if the deal goes well  because I'm going to get a very good commission as well.  And I said   That's amazing  What are you going to spend your cut on   And he said   On RealEstate  what about you   I thought about it for a long time. And I said   One word  Hummus.   It's going places. I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like    different varieties. Also you can cut up carrots  and you can dip them. Have you ever done that  Solomon   He said   I have to go bed now.   Till morrow. Have sweet dream.  I didn't know what to say  I said   Bonsoir my golden nugget  bonsoir.  Guys  you have to understand  this had been going for  like  weeks  albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life  but I had to knock it on the head. It was getting a bit out of hand. Friends were saying   James  do you want to come for a drink   I was like   I can't  I'm expecting an email about some gold.  So I figured I had to knock it on the head. I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. So I concocted a plan. I said   Solomon  I'm concerned about security. When we email each other  we need to use a code.  And he agreed. I said   Solomon  I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence  Lawyer  Gummy Bear. Bank  Cream Egg. Legal  Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim  Peanut M Ms. Documents  Jelly Beans. Western Union  A Giant Gummy Lizard.  I knew these were all words they use  right  I said   Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence.  I didn't hear back. I thought  I've gone too far. I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. I said   Solomon  Is the deal still on  KitKat.  Because you have to be consistent. Then I did get an email back from him. He said   The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ...  I said   Dude  you have to use the code   What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. I'm not joking  this is what turned up in my inbox. This was a good day.  The business is on. I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear    so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg  for the Peanut M Ms process to start. Send       pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard.  And that was so much fun  right  that it got me thinking  like  what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could  And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. It's really difficult  and I highly recommend we do it. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. All I'm doing is wasting their time. And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings  right  And if you're going to do this    and I highly recommend you do    get yourself a pseudonymous email address. Don't use your own email address. That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements  only one of which was a legitimate response    to a medical question I had. But I'll tell you what  though  guys  I'll tell you what  any day is a good day  any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this   I AM WINNIE MANDELA  THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT.  I was like  oh     that Winnie Mandela. I know so many.  I NEED TO TRANSFER    MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION.  Let that sink in. She sent me this  which is hysterical. And this. And this looks fairly legitimate  this is a letter of authorization. But to be honest  if there's nothing written on it  it's just a shape  I said   Winnie  I'm really sorry to hear of this. Given that Nelson died three months ago  I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious.  That's the worst health condition you can have  not being alive. She said   KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ONE LOVE.  I said   Of course. NO WOMAN  NO CRY.  She said   MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF      DOLLARS. ONE LOVE.  I said   no problemo. I SHOT THE SHERIFF.     BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY    Thank you. Late in January       a    year old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House. The auditorium was empty. It was lit only by the dim  green glow of the emergency exit sign. This was the most exciting day of Vera's life. She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany  and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late night concert of jazz from the American musician  Keith Jarrett.       people were coming. And in just a few hours  Jarrett would walk out on the same stage  he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music  he would begin to play. But right now  Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question  and it wasn't going well. Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily  played a few notes  walked around it  played a few more notes  muttered something to his producer. Then the producer came over to Vera and said ...  If you don't get a new piano  Keith can't play.  There'd been a mistake. The opera house had provided the wrong instrument. This one had this harsh  tinny upper register  because all the felt had worn away. The black notes were sticking  the white notes were out of tune  the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small. It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House. So Keith Jarrett left. He went and sat outside in his car  leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano. Now she got a piano tuner  but she couldn't get a new piano. And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain  talking to Keith Jarrett  begging him not to cancel the concert. And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled  rain drenched German teenager  took pity on her  and said   Never forget ... only for you.  And so a few hours later  Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house  he sat down at the unplayable piano and began. Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening. Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers  he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard  which gave the piece a soothing  ambient quality. But also  because the piano was so quiet  he had to set up these rumbling  repetitive riffs in the bass. And he stood up twisting  pounding down on the keys  desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row. It's an electrifying performance. It somehow has this peaceful quality  and at the same time it's full of energy  it's dynamic. And the audience loved it. Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the K ln Concert is the best selling piano album in history and the best selling solo jazz album in history. Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess. He had embraced that mess  and it soared. But let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct. He didn't want to play. Of course  I think any of us  in any remotely similar situation  would feel the same way  we'd have the same instinct. We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools. We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles. But Jarrett's instinct was wrong  and thank goodness he changed his mind. And I think our instinct is also wrong. I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess. So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology  from complexity science  from social psychology  and of course  rock 'n' roll. So cognitive psychology first. We've actually known for a while that certain kinds of difficulty  certain kinds of obstacle  can actually improve our performance. For example  the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer  a few years ago  teamed up with high school teachers. And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes. So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward  such as Helvetica or Times New Roman. But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense  like Haettenschweiler  or something with a zesty bounce  like Comic Sans italicized. Now  these are really ugly fonts  and they're difficult fonts to read. But at the end of the semester  students were given exams  and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts  had actually done better on their exams  in a variety of subjects. And the reason is  the difficult font had slowed them down  forced them to work a bit harder  to think a bit more about what they were reading  to interpret it ... and so they learned more. Another example. The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters. What do I mean by that  What I mean is  imagine you're in a restaurant  you're having a conversation  there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant  you want to filter them out  you want to focus on what's important to you. Can you do that  If you can  you have good  strong attentional filters. But some people really struggle with that. Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that. They had weak filters  they had porous filters    let a lot of external information in. And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them. If there was a television on while they were doing their essays  they couldn't screen it out. Now  you would think that that was a disadvantage ... but no. When Carson looked at what these students had achieved  the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives  to have published their first novel  to have released their first album. These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill. They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes. Let's talk about complexity science. So how do you solve a really complex    the world's full of complicated problems    how do you solve a really complicated problem  For example  you try to make a jet engine. There are lots and lots of different variables  the operating temperature  the materials  all the different dimensions  the shape. You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go  it's too hard. So what do you do  Well  one thing you can do is try to solve it step by step. So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it  you test it  you improve it. You tweak it  you test it  you improve it. Now  this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine. And it's been quite widely implemented in the world. So you'll hear about it  for example  in high performance cycling  web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages  they're looking for these step by step gains. That's a good way to solve a complicated problem. But you know what would make it a better way  A dash of mess. You add randomness  early on in the process  you make crazy moves  you try stupid things that shouldn't work  and that will tend to make the problem solving work better. And the reason for that is the trouble with the step by step process  the marginal gains  is they can walk you gradually down a dead end. And if you start with the randomness  that becomes less likely  and your problem solving becomes more robust. Let's talk about social psychology. So the psychologist Katherine Phillips  with some colleagues  recently gave murder mystery problems to some students  and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime    alibis and evidence  witness statements and three suspects. And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it  who committed the crime. And there were two treatments in this experiment. In some cases these were four friends  they all knew each other well. In other cases  three friends and a stranger. And you can see where I'm going with this. Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively  which is true  they did. Actually  they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively. So the groups of four friends  they only had a       chance of getting the answer right. Which is actually not that great    in multiple choice  for three answers       's not good. The three friends and the stranger  even though the stranger didn't have any extra information  even though it was just a case of how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness  the three friends and the stranger  they had a    percent chance of finding the right answer. That's quite a big leap in performance. But I think what's really interesting is not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job  but how they felt about it. So when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends  they had a nice time  they also thought they'd done a good job. They were complacent. When she spoke to the three friends and the stranger  they had not had a nice time    it's actually rather difficult  it's rather awkward ... and they were full of doubt. They didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had. And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here. Because  yeah    the ugly font  the awkward stranger  the random move ... these disruptions help us solve problems  they help us become more creative. But we don't feel that they're helping us. We feel that they're getting in the way ... and so we resist. And that's why the last example is really important. So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll. And you may know him  he's actually a TED ster. His name is Brian Eno. He is an ambient composer    rather brilliant. He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last    years. He's worked with David Bowie on  Heroes   he worked with U  on  Achtung Baby  and  The Joshua Tree   he's worked with DEVO  he's worked with Coldplay  he's worked with everybody. And what does he do to make these great rock bands better  Well  he makes a mess. He disrupts their creative processes. It's his role to be the awkward stranger. It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano. And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards    I have my signed copy here    thank you  Brian. They're called The Oblique Strategies  he developed them with a friend of his. And when they're stuck in the studio  Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards. He'll draw one at random  and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card. So this one ...  Change instrument roles.  Yeah  everyone swap instruments    Drummer on the piano    Brilliant  brilliant idea.  Look closely at the most  embarrassing details. Amplify them.   Make a sudden  destructive  unpredictable action. Incorporate.  These cards are disruptive. Now  they've proved their worth in album after album. The musicians hate them. So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album. He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio. Carlos Alomar  great rock guitarist  working with Eno on David Bowie's  Lodger  album  and at one point he turns to Brian and says   Brian  this experiment is stupid.  But the thing is it was a pretty good album  but also  Carlos Alomar     years later  now uses The Oblique Strategies. And he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies because he's realized something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you. The strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally  they were just a list    list on the recording studio wall. A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck. The list didn't work. Know why  Not messy enough. Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive  the least troublesome  which of course misses the point entirely. And what Brian Eno came to realize was  yes  we need to run the stupid experiments  we need to deal with the awkward strangers  we need to try to read the ugly fonts. These things help us. They help us solve problems  they help us be more creative. But also ... we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this. So however we do it ... whether it's sheer willpower  whether it's the flip of a card or whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager  all of us  from time to time  need to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano. Thank you. I have been a police officer for a very  very long time. And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher. And if you know anything about black preachers  we'll close  and then we'll keep going for another    minutes. So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward. I've been a police officer for a very long time  and I mean I predated technology. I'm talking about before pagers. Laugh if you want to  but I'm telling the truth. I predate War on Our Fellow Man    I mean  War on Drugs. I predate all of that. I predate so much and I've been through ebbs and flows and I've been through good and bad times  and still I absolutely love being a police officer. I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me and never a job. And even with that  my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis. It's an invisible crisis  and it has been for many  many years. Even though we in law enforcement say   You know what  We can't arrest our way out of this.  We say in law enforcement things like   Yeah  it's illegal to profile.  You know what  In law enforcement  we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and become more oriented to community policing. And yet all the while  still  we continue in the same vein  the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted. And so that's the reason for me  several years ago. Because I was tired of the racism  I was tired of discrimination  I was tired of the   isms  and the schisms. I was just so tired. I was tired of the vicious cycle  and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that I still love today. And so my wife and I  we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire. We would retire and I would go off into the sunset  maybe do ministry full time  love my wife a long time. Y'all know what I'm talking about. But we decided that I would retire. But then there was a higher power than I. There was a love for the city that I loved  that I grew up in  that I was educated in    a city that pulled my heart back into the system. So we didn't retire. We didn't retire and so what happened was  over the next    I would say     months     months  I had this passion to implement some radical policing. And so now  over the next    months  I shifted  and I transcended from being a drug sergeant    ready to retire as a drug sergeant    and went from level to level to level  until I find myself as a district commander  commander of the worst district in Baltimore city. We call it the Eastern District  the most violent district  the most impoverished district       percent unemployment in that district. National rating at that time  national rating  the AIDS and the tuberculosis  rating   was always on the top    list for zip codes for cities across the nation  or just zip codes across the nation. The top       I didn't say state  I didn't say city    that little neighborhood. And I said  you know what  We gotta do something different. We gotta do something different. We gotta think radical. We gotta think outside the box. And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted and I desperately felt in my heart  I had to start listening to that inner spirit. I had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that I had been trained to do. But we still did it. We still did it because we listened to that inner spirit  because I realized this  if I was to see real police reform in the communities that I had authority over for public safety  we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'. We had to change it. And so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily. So we thought differently. And we started to realize that it could never be and never should have been us versus them. And so I decided to come to that intersection where I could meet all classes  all races  all creeds  all colors  where I would meet the businesses and the faith based  and the eds  the meds  and I would meet all the people that made up the communities that I had authority over. So I met them and I began to listen. See  police have a problem. Off the top  we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments  but we never talk to the community about them. And we shove them into the community and say   Take that.  But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin'  so we talked to our communities. We said   This is your community table. We'll pull up a chair. We want to hear from you. What's going to work in your community   And then some great things started to happen. See  here's the thing  I had to figure out a way to shift     cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners. I had to figure out how to do that. Because here's the crazy thing  in law enforcement  we have evolved into something incredible. Listen  we have become great protectors. We know how to protect you. But we have exercised that arm so much  so very much. If I was a natural police department and I represented a police department  you would see this incredible  beautiful     inch arm. It's pretty  ain't it  It's cut up. No fat on it. Mmm it look good. It just look good  That's a great arm    protection  That's who we are  but we've exercised it so much sometimes that it has led to abuse. It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us. And we've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve. Y'all don't know that  Protect and serve. So you look at the other arm  and then you look at it and ... there it is. You know  it's kinda weak. It looks sickly. It's withering and it's dying because we've invested so much in our protective arm. But we forgot to treat our communities like they're our customers  like they're our sons and daughters  our brothers and sisters  our mothers and fathers. And so somehow  along the way  we've gotten out of balance. And because we are a proud profession  it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes. It's even harder to make a change. And so  as I try to hurry and get through this  I need to say this  it's not just law enforcement  though. Because every one of us makes up a community. Everybody makes up a community. And as communities    can I say this     we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement. Too much. And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action. There is no way in the world that we  as a community  should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street. No way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor's music is up too loud  because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two  there's no way we should be calling the police. But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility. Listen  when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore    and listen  we played rough in the street    I ain't never see the police come and break us up. You know who came  It was the elders. It was the parental figures in the community. It was those guardians  it was that village mentality. They came and said   Stop that   and  Do this.  and  Stop that.  We had mentors throughout all of the community. So it takes all of us  all of us. And when I say community  I'm talking about everything that makes up a community  even    listen  because I'm a preacher  I'm very hard on the churches  because I believe the churches too often have become MIA  missing in action. I believe they have shifted over the last        years from being community churches  where you walk outside your door  round the corner and you're in church. They shifted from that and became commuter churches. So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they're planted. And they don't take care of that community. I could go on and on  but I really need to wrap this up. Community and policing  we've all lost that precious gift  and I call it relational equity. We've lost it with one another. It's not somebody else's fault    it's all of our fault. We all take responsibility in this. But I say this  it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again. It is never too late. It is never too late. You see  after three years of my four and a half year commandship in that district  three years in  after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this    it's a little secret    I knew this  it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy. You'd be getting in and out of the car  looking to your right  talking about   Father  forgive me  for I have sinned   all day long    you can't do it  So we came up with some incredible initiatives  engagements for our community and police to build that trust back. We began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence. We knew we had an economic problem  so we began to create jobs. We knew there was sickness in our community and they didn't have access to proper medical care  so we'd partner up. We got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically  never thinking about the crime. Because at the end of the day  if we took care of the needs of the people  if we got to the root cause  the crime would take care of itself. It would take care of itself. And so  after three years of a four and a half year stint  we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a    year historical low  our crime numbers  our homicides    everything had dropped down  back to the     s. And it might go back further  but the problem is  we only started keeping data since     . Forty year crime low  so much so  I had other commanders call me   Hey Mel  whatcha doin'  man  Whatcha doin'  We gotta get some of that   And so we gave them some of that. And in a short period of time  the city went to a    year crime low. For the first time in    years  we fell  Baltimore city  to under     homicides        to be exact. And we celebrated  because we had learned to become great servers  become great servers first. But I gotta tell you this  these last few years  as much as we had learned to become great proactive police officers and great relational police officers rather than reactive  these last years have disappointed me. They have broken my heart. The uprising still hurts. It still hurts my heart  because truly I believe that it should've never happened. I believe it should've never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in  servicing our community  treating them like human beings  treating them with respect  loving on them first. If we continued in that vein  it would've never happened. But somehow  we went back to business as usual. But I'm excited again  I'm excited again  because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing  but he absolutely understands it  and more importantly  he embraces it. So I'm very excited now. Listen  I'm excited about Baltimore today  because we  as many cities  I believe shall rise from the ashes. I believe    I truly believe    that we will be great again. I believe  as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say   We're in this together   because it's not just an intersection  once we meet  we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals  and this city will become great again. This nation will become great again. Because we have the same goal  we all want peace. We all want respect for one another. We all want love. And I believe we are back on that road  and I'm so excited about it. So listen  I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time. God bless you all. God bless you. I once said   If you want to liberate a society  all you need is the Internet.  I was wrong. I said those words back in       when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential  but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart. I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism  and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced and what we could do about them. In the early     s  Arabs were flooding the web. Thirsty for knowledge  for opportunities  for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe  we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual  alternative life. Just like many of them  I was completely apolitical until     . At the time  when I logged into social media  I started seeing more and more Egyptians aspiring for political change in the country. It felt like I was not alone. In June       Internet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook  I saw a photo  a terrifying photo  of a tortured  dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a    year old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. I thought   I could be Khaled.  I could not sleep that night  and I decided to do something. I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it  We are all Khaled Said.  In just three days  the page had over         people  fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern. Whatever was happening had to stop. I recruited my co admin  AbdelRahman Mansour. We worked together for hours and hours. We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people. We were engaging them. We were calling collectively for actions  and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know. The page became the most followed page in the Arab world. It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities. On January           Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime. I saw a spark of hope. Egyptians on social media were wondering   If Tunisia did it  why can't we   I posted an event on Facebook and called it  A Revolution against Corruption  Injustice and Dictatorship.  I posed a question to the         users of the page at the time   Today is the   th of January. The   th of January is Police Day. It's a national holiday. If         of us take to the streets of Cairo  no one is going to stop us. I wonder if we could do it.  In just a few days  the invitation reached over a million people  and over         people confirmed attendance. Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it. At the time  they didn't even understand it. And on January   th  Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities  calling for change  breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era. Then came the consequences. A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications  I was walking in a dark street in Cairo  around midnight. I had just tweeted   Pray for Egypt. The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow.  I was hit hard on my head. I lost my balance and fell down  to find four armed men surrounding me. One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me. I knew I was being kidnapped by state security. I found myself in a cell  handcuffed  blindfolded. I was terrified. So was my family  who started looking for me in hospitals  police stations and even morgues. After my disappearance  a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page  and that I was likely arrested by state security. My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me  and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release. After    days of complete darkness  I was set free. And three days later  Mubarak was forced to step down. It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life. It was a time of great hope. Egyptians lived a utopia for    days during the revolution. They all shared the belief that we could actually live together despite our differences  that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all. But unfortunately  the post revolution events were like a punch in the gut. The euphoria faded  we failed to build consensus  and the political struggle led to intense polarization. Social media only amplified that state  by facilitating the spread of misinformation  rumors  echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls  lies  hate speech. I started to worry about the safety of my family. But of course  this wasn't just about me. The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers    the army supporters and the Islamists. People in the center  like me  started feeling helpless. Both groups wanted you to side with them  you were either with them or against them. And on the  rd of July       the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president  after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation. That day I made a very hard decision. I decided to go silent  completely silent. It was a moment of defeat. I stayed silent for more than two years  and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened  trying to understand why did it happen. It became clear to me that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven by our human behavior  social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact. Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact  pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like. These are all natural human impulses  but because of technology  acting on these impulses is only one click away. In my view  there are five critical challenges facing today's social media. First  we don't know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people. Second  we create our own echo chambers. We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with  and thanks to social media  we can mute  un follow and block everybody else. Third  online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. All of us probably know that. It's as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars. And fourth  it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media  we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in     characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that  it lives forever on the Internet  and we are less motivated to change these views  even when new evidence arises. Fifth    and in my point of view  this is the most critical    today  our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements  posts over discussions  shallow comments over deep conversations. It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other. I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society  but this is not just about Egypt. Polarization is on the rise in the whole world. We need to work hard on figuring out how technology could be part of the solution  rather than part of the problem. There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls. This is so important. No one could argue against that. But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness. I know for a fact if I write a post that is more sensational  more one sided  sometimes angry and aggressive  I get to have more people see that post. I will get more attention. But what if we put more focus on quality  What is more important  the total number of readers of a post you write  or who are the people who have impact that read what you write  Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations  rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time  Or reward people for reading and responding to views that they disagree with  And also  make it socially acceptable that we change our minds  or probably even reward that  What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds  and that becomes part of our social media experience  If I could track how many people are changing their minds  I'd probably write more thoughtfully  trying to do that  rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me and  liking  because I just confirmed their biases. We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms  to fact check widely spread online information  and reward people who take part in that. In essence  we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness  civility and mutual understanding. As a believer in the Internet  I teamed up with a few friends  started a new project  trying to find answers and explore possibilities. Our first product is a new media platform for conversations. We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds. We don't claim to have the answers  but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues  such as race  gun control  the refugee debate  relationship between Islam and terrorism. These are conversations that matter. Today  at least one out of three people on the planet have access to the Internet. But part of this Internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior. Five years ago  I said   If you want to liberate society  all you need is the Internet.  Today  I believe if we want to liberate society  we first need to liberate the Internet. Thank you very much. For much of the past century  architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.  Form follows function  had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket  as it liberated architecture from the decorative  but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose. Of course  architecture is about function  but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi  and I want to propose a completely different quality. If form follows fiction  we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories    stories of the people that live there  of the people that work in these buildings. And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create. In this sense  I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real  as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it. Our buildings are prototypes  ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different  and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today. Our buildings are real  they're being built. They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility. I think of our architecture as organizational structures. At their core is indeed structural thinking  like a system  How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way  How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives  And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture  while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time  And here comes the second term into play  what I call  narrative hybrids     structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create. So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships  both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way. This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster  which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA. When I first arrived in Beijing in       the city planners showed us this image  a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district  except at that time  only a handful of them existed. So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about  except one thing  it would all be about verticality. Of course  the skyscraper is vertical    it's a profoundly hierarchical structure  the top always the best  the bottom the worst  and the taller you are  the better  so it seems. And we wanted to ask ourselves  could a building be about a completely different quality  Could it undo this hierarchy  and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration  rather than isolation  So we took this needle and bent it back into itself  into a loop of interconnected activities. Our idea was to bring all aspects of television making into one single structure  news  program production  broadcasting  research and training  administration    all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration. I still very much like this image. It reminds one of biology classes  if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems  like at school. And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance  but as an organism  as a life form. And as you start to dissect this organism  you can identify a series of primary technical clusters    program production  broadcasting center and news. Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters  meeting rooms  canteens  chat areas    informal spaces for people to meet and exchange. So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social  the human and the performative. And of course  we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system  to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity. With         square meters  it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world. It has a population of over        people  and of course  this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture. So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut        little sticks and glued them onto a model  just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant. But of course  it's not a number  it is the people  it is a community that inhabits the building  and in order to both comprehend this  but also script this architecture  we identified five characters  hypothetical characters  and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building  thought of where they would meet  what they would experience. So it was a way to script and design the building  but of course  also to communicate its experiences. This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing. This is the main broadcast control room  a technical installation so large  it can broadcast over     channels simultaneously. And this is how the building stands in Beijing today. Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics       after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics. And you can see at the very tip of this    meter cantilever  those three little circles. And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building. They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion. The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing. It is there. It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography. But its most important moment is maybe sill this one.  That's Beijing  is similar to  Time Out   a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week  and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter  but actually as an urban actor  as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city. So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player  of something that writes stories and performs stories. And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in. But of course  there's another story to this building. It is the story of the people that made it        engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building  in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China. This is a residential development in Singapore  large scale. If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world  of course  it is dominated by the tower  a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness  and I wanted to ask  how could we think about living  not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment  but in an idea of a collective  How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own  The typical answer to the question    we had to design       apartments    would have looked like this     story height limit given by the planning authorities     towers with nothing but residual in between    a very tight system that  although the tower isolates you  it doesn't even give you privacy  because you're so close to the next one  that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be. So I proposed to topple the towers  throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up  and what looks a bit random from the side  if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter  you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid  in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards    central spaces for the community  programmed with a variety of amenities and functions. And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces. They're open  permeable  they're interconnected. We called the project  The Interlace   thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike. And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants. And  in fact  it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces  stacked to more and more individual and private spaces. So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual. A little piece of math  if we count all the green that we left on the ground  minus the footprint of the buildings  and we would add back the green of all the terraces  we have     percent green space  so more nature than not having built a building. And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there. This is  in fact  the   th floor of one of these terraces. So you see new datum planes  new grounds planes for social activity. We paid a lot of attention to sustainability. In the tropics  the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to  and  in fact  it is seeking protection from the sun. We first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year. We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building. But most importantly  we could prove that through the geometry of the building design  the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year. We further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors  so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that  again  would enhance the quality of those spaces available for the inhabitants. And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices  of freedom to think where you would want to be  where you would want to escape  maybe  within the own complexity of the complex in which you live. But coming from Asia to Europe  a building for a German media company based in Berlin  transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media. And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions  Why would anyone today still want to go to the office  because you can actually work anywhere  And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building  We created not only an object  but at the center of this object we created a giant space  and this space was about the experience of a collective  the experience of collaboration and of togetherness. Communication  interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float  like what we call the collaborative cloud  in the middle of the building  surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices. So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk  you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space. Finally  we come to London  a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London. We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park. In the   th century  Prince Albert had created Albertopolis. And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis. The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions  some international ones  and to create a new system of synergies. Prince Albert  as yet  created Albertopolis in the   th century  thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind  bringing arts and science closer together. And he built Exhibition Road  a linear sequence of those institutions. But of course  today's society has moved on from there. We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other. We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains  and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations. So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine  a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains  but allow them to interact and collaborate. At the base of it is a very simple module  a ring module. It can function as a double loaded corridor  has daylight  has ventilation. It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space. These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could  over time  occupy any of these modules. So institutions could shrink or contract  as  of course  the future of culture is  in a way  the most uncertain of all. This is how the building sits  adjacent to the Aquatics Centre  opposite the Olympic Stadium. And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside. The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity  in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume. Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris. It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project  but also the difference  here  it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure  in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity. And it was this thought  to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted    for those in the educational parts that create and think culture  for those that present the visual arts  the dance  and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories  to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience. And I want to end on a project that is very small  in a way  very different  a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand. Friends of mine had founded a film festival  and I thought  if we think of the stories and narratives of movies  we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them. So I designed a small modular floating platform  based on the techniques of local fishermen  how they built their lobster and fish farms. We collaborated with the local community and built  out of recycled materials of their own  this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive          Alice in Wonderland   for example. The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies. So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter  of the built environment  but is really about how we want to live our lives  how we script our own stories and those of others. Thank you. I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought tolerant crops  which should go some way to providing food security in the world  lies in resurrection plants  pictured here  in an extremely droughted state. You might think that these plants look dead  but they're not. Give them water  and they will resurrect  green up  start growing  in    to    hours. Now  why would I suggest that producing drought tolerant crops will go towards providing food security  Well  the current world population is around   billion. And it's estimated that by       we'll be between   and    billion people  with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa. The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a    percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand. Given that plants are at the base of the food chain  most of that's going to have to come from plants. That percentage of    percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change. This is taken from a study by Dai published in       where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them    amongst other things    increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. The areas in red shown here  are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture  but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall. This is the situation that's predicted to happen in     . Much of Africa  in fact  much of the world  is going to be in trouble. We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food. And preferably among them  some drought tolerant crops. The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed. Now  making drought tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world. And the reason for this is water. Water is essential to life on this planet. All living  actively metabolizing organisms  from microbes to you and I  are comprised predominately of water. All life reactions happen in water. And loss of a small amount of water results in death. You and I are    percent water    we lose one percent of that  we die. But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that. Plants can't. They're stuck in the ground. And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us  about    percent water  and they can lose a little bit more than us  like    to about    percent  depending on the species  but for short periods only. Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss. So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents. They tend to be small  very attractive  but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs. They send down very deep roots  mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times  keeping themselves hydrated. The one on the right is called a baobab. It's also called the upside down tree  simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down. And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant. And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals. Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies. Up the west coast of my country  for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth. But come the spring rains  you get this  flowering of the desert. The strategy in annuals  is to grow only in the rainy season. At the end of that season they produce a seed  which is dry  eight to    percent water  but very much alive. And anything that is that dry and still alive  we call desiccation tolerant. In the desiccated state  what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time. The next time the rainy season comes  they germinate and grow  and the whole cycle just starts again. It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants  or angiosperms  onto land. But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies. Wheat  rice and maize form    percent of our plant food supplies. And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed. Seeds are energy rich so there's a lot of food calories  you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine  but there's a downside. The vegetative tissues  the roots and leaves of annuals  do not have much by way of inherent resistance  avoidance or tolerance characteristics. They just don't need them. They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year. And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance  avoidance and tolerance    particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work    we still get images like this. Maize crop in Africa  two weeks without rain and it's dead. There is a solution  resurrection plants. These plants can lose    percent of their cellular water  remain in a dry  dead like state for months to years  and give them water  they green up and start growing again. Like seeds  these are desiccation tolerant. Like seeds  these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions. And this is a really rare phenomenon. There are only     flowering plant species that can do this. I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom  there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens. Pretty amazing  huh  So I've spent the last    years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying  And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants  shown here in the hydrated and dry states  for a number of reasons. One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought tolerant. So on the extreme top left  for example  is a grass  it's called Eragrostis nindensis  it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef    a lot of you might know it as  teff     it's a staple food in Ethiopia  it's gluten free  and it's something we would like to make drought tolerant. The other reason for looking at a number of plants  is that  at least initially  I wanted to find out  do they do the same thing  Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die  So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance  in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant  ecophysiological level. For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome  which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off  in response to drying. Most genes will code for proteins  so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins made in response to drying  Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites  so we look at the metabolome. Now  this is important because plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment. So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying. And at the last study that we do at the molecular level  we look at the lipidome    the lipid changes in response to drying. And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids. They're held as membranes because they're in water. Take away the water  those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes. Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies. And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment. I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application. I'm sure some of you are thinking   By biotic application  does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops   And the answer to that question is  depends on your definition of genetic modification. All of the crops that we eat today  wheat  rice and maize  are highly genetically modified from their ancestors  but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding. If you mean  am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops  your answer is yes. In the essence of time  we have tried that approach. More appropriately  some of my collaborators at UCT  Jennifer Thomson  Suhail Rafudeen  have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon. But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach  in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not. I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work. So you probably all know that genes are made of double stranded DNA. It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA  you get genes. And each gene has a promoter  which is just an on off switch  the gene coding region  and then a terminator  which indicates that this is the end of this gene  the next gene will start. Now  promoters are not simple on off switches. They normally require a lot of fine tuning  lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on. So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter  we know how to switch it on. We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds. In the study that I'm going to talk to you about  my collaborators used a drought induced promoter  which we discovered in a resurrection plant. The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought. And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes  Well  all stresses  particularly drought stress  results in the formation of free radicals  or reactive oxygen species  which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. What antioxidants do is stop that damage. So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa. To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes  to the right    plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering  the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better. Now to the final approach. My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants. So I ask the question  are they using the same genes  Or slightly differently phrased  are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves  Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants  And I answer that question  as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands  Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes  that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both. And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize  where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development  they switch these genes on. Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops  therefore  have these genes in their roots and leaves  they just never switch them on. They only switch them on in seed tissues. So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants  to mimic the process in crops. And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some    to    million years ago. My plants and I thank you for your attention. I have a question. Can a computer write poetry  This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute  and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like  What is a computer  What is poetry  What is creativity  But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer  not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try a different approach. So up here  we have two poems. One of them is written by a human  and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which. Have a go  Poem    Little Fly   Thy summer's play    My thoughtless hand   Has brush'd away. Am I not   A fly like thee    Or art not thou   A man like me  Poem    We can feel   Activist through your life's   morning   Pauses to see  pope I hate the   Non all the night to start a   great otherwise  ...  Alright  time's up. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. OK  most of you. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Very brave of you  because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically  according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again  you haven't got ages to read this  so just trust your gut. Poem    A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting   and fascinating that a bird will fly and not   roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I   am not exhausted or weary. Poem    Oh  kangaroos  sequins  chocolate sodas    You are really beautiful  Pearls    harmonicas  jujubes  aspirins  All   the stuff they've always talked about  ...  Alright  time's up. So if you think the first poem was written by a human  put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem was written by a human  put your hand up. We have  more or less  a       split here. It was much harder. The answer is  the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter  that was created back in the     s  and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara  who happens to be one of my favorite human poets. So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed by this guy  Alan Turing  in       in order to answer the question  can computers think  Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text based conversation with a human  with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human  then the computer can be said to have intelligence. So in       my friend Benjamin Laird and I  we created a Turing test for poetry online. It's called bot or not  and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically  it's the game we just played. You're presented with a poem  you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online  so we have results. And what are the results  Well  Turing said that if a computer could fool a human    percent of the time that it was a human  then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled    percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So  I think we have an answer to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test  can a computer write poetry  Well  yes  absolutely it can. But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer  that's OK. If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it  that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story. Let's play our third and final test. Again  you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human. Poem    Reg flags the reason for pretty flags.   And ribbons. Ribbons of flags   And wearing material   Reasons for wearing material.  ...  Poem    A wounded deer leaps highest    I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to day   I've heard the hunter tell    'Tis but the ecstasy of death    And then the brake is almost done  ...  OK  time is up. So hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem   was written by a human. Whoa  that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem   was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem   was generated by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on  let me describe very quickly and simply  how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil  who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence. So  you give RKCP a source text  it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language  and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text. So in the poem we just saw before  Poem    the one that you all thought was human  it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language  learned the model  and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using. The language is just raw material  it could be Chinese  it could be in Swedish  it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless  it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem  and Gertrude Stein is a human. So what we've done here is  more or less  a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein  who's a human  is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore  according to the logic of the reverse Turing test  Gertrude Stein is a computer. Feeling confused  I think that's fair enough. So far we've had humans that write like humans  we have computers that write like computers  we have computers that write like humans  but we also have  perhaps most confusingly  humans that write like computers. So what do we take from all of this  Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein  Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake  These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now  and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology. So my first insight is that  for some reason  we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask   Can a computer write poetry   we're also asking   What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category  How do we say who or what can be part of this category   This is an essentially philosophical question  I believe  and it can't be answered with a yes or no test  like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing understood this  and that when he devised his test back in       he was doing it as a philosophical provocation. So my second insight is that  when we take the Turing test for poetry  we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry generating algorithms  they're pretty simple and have existed  more or less  since the     s. What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry  rather  is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness. So  what I've figured out  we've seen this when earlier today  we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course  this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer. It simply means that the category of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold  hard fact. Rather  it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time. So my final insight is that the computer  more or less  works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson  it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake  that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein  what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology  the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it. So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is  can we build it  Can we build an intelligent computer  Can we build a creative computer  What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human like computer  But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact  that it's an ever shifting  concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future  we shouldn't only be asking ourselves   Can we build it   But we should also be asking ourselves   What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us   This is an essentially philosophical idea  and it's one that can't be answered with software alone  but I think requires a moment of species wide  existential reflection. Thank you. Welcome to Bayeku  a riverine community in Ikorodu  Lagos    a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria  communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed  communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered  fishing  marine transportation and trading  communities where fish yields have diminished  communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days  sometimes weeks  on end. Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves  inflated stems  and showy  lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities. The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name  Eichhornia crassipes. Interestingly  in Nigeria  the plant is also known by other names  names associated with historical events  as well as myths. In some places  the plant is called Babangida. When you hear Babangida  you remember the military and military coups. And you think  fear  restraint. In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta  the plant is also known as Abiola. When you hear Abiola  you remember annulled elections and you think  dashed hopes. In the southwestern part of Nigeria  the plant is known as Gbe'borun. Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to  gossip   or  talebearer.  When you think of gossip  you think  rapid reproduction  destruction. And in the Igala speaking part of Nigeria  the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma  And when you hear that  you think of death. It literally translates to  death to mother and child.  I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year     . It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith  a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. And so here I was in the year       actually  at the end of       in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge. And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself   These poor fisherfolk  how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions.  And then I thought   There's got to be a better way.  A win win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed. That  I would say  was my spark moment. And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed. Out of the several  one struck me the most. It was the use of the plant for handicrafts. And I thought   What a great idea.  Personally  I love handicrafts  especially handicrafts that are woven around a story. And so I thought   This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills.  And I thought to myself   Three simple steps to a mega solution.  First step  Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth. That way  you create access. Secondly  you dry the water hyacinth stems. And thirdly  you weave the water hyacinth into products. The third step was a challenge. See  I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts. And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave. And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan  where I lived  called Sabo. Sabo translates to  strangers' quarters.  And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country. So I literally took my dried weeds in hand  there were several more of them  and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes. And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya. The problem  though  is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa. But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate. And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes. With my long ropes in hand  I was now equipped to make products. And that was the beginning of partnerships. Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products. So with this in hand  I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity. So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold. So we have pens  we have tableware  we have purses  we have tissue boxes. Thereby  helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable  being aesthetic  being durable  tough  resilient. Changing names  changing livelihoods. From Gbe'borun  gossip  to Olusotan  storyteller. And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma  which is  killer of mother and child   to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma   provider of food for mother and child.  And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. He said   If you want to learn about a culture  listen to the stories. And if you want to change a culture  change the stories.  And so  from Makoko community  to Abobiri  to Ewoi  to Kolo  to Owahwa  Esaba  we have changed the story. Thank you for listening. Imagine you're in Rome  and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums. And you've been shuffling down long corridors  past statues  frescoes  lots and lots of stuff. You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. At last    a long corridor  a stair and a door. You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel. So what are you expecting  Soaring domes  Choirs of angels  We don't really have any of that there. Instead  you may ask yourself  what do we have  Well  curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. And I mean literally  you're surrounded by painted curtains  the original decoration of this chapel. Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses  but as a way to represent the great theater of life. The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story  a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel. Now  this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy  educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there. Five hundred years ago  it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave. So  you may ask  how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year  from all different backgrounds  Because in that compressed space  there was a creative explosion  ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers  which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history. Now  this development took place as a great evolution  moving from the beginning of a few elite  and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world. This evolution took place in three stages  each one linked to a historical circumstance. The first one was rather limited in scope. It reflected the rather parochial perspective. The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage  and the third  when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global. The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world. There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses  reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people. The man who commissioned this  Pope Sixtus IV  assembled a dream team of Florentine art  including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher  Ghirlandaio. These men  they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color  and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes  the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story  something much more familiar. With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family  this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent. But in       the New World was discovered  horizons were expanding  and this little     by    foot microcosm had to expand as well. And it did  thanks to a creative genius  a visionary and an awesome story. Now  the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti     years old when he was tapped to decorate        square feet of ceiling  and the deck was stacked against him    he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture. There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions  lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project  and that project had fallen through. And he had been left with a commission to paint    apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling  which would look like every other ceiling in Italy. But genius rose to the challenge. In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean  Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters. He  too  would tell a story    no Apostles    but a story of great beginnings  the story of Genesis. Not really an easy sell  stories on a ceiling. How would you be able to read a busy scene from    feet below  The painting technique that had been handed on for     years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative. But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter  and so he played to his strengths. Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness  he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within. Michelangelo was an essentialist  he would tell his story in massive  dynamic bodies. This plan was embraced by the larger than life Pope Julius II  a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV  and he had been steeped in art for    years and he knew its power. And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope  but this man's legacy to the Vatican    it wasn't fortresses and artillery  it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms  the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco Roman sculptures    decidedly un Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum  the Vatican Museums. Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty  and he was right. The encounter between these two giants  Michelangelo and Julius II  that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was so committed to this project  that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years  using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time  hours on end  reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling. So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global. No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy  a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels  more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. And we stand in the far end by the entrance  far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance  looking for a beginning. And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition  we think in terms of a primal spark. Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark  a churning figure blurry in the distance  compressed into a tight space. The next figure looms larger  and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. He leaves in his wake the sun  the moon  vegetation. Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created  unlike all the other artists. He focused on the act of creation. And then the movement stops  like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing  Is he creating land  Is he creating sea  Or is he looking back over his handiwork  the universe and his treasures  just like Michelangelo must have  looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming   It is good.  So now the scene is set  and you get to the culmination of creation  which is man. Adam leaps to the eye  a light figure against a dark background. But looking closer  that leg is pretty languid on the ground  the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness. That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger  which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats  because we're one moment from that contact  through which that man will discover his purpose  leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation. And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm  Eve  first woman. No  she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan. She's always been in his mind. Look at her  so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm. And for me  an American art historian from the   st century  this was the moment that the painting spoke to me. Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women    so much so  that the dead center  the heart of the ceiling  is the creation of woman  not Adam. And the fact is  that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden  they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame. You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling. You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church. The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum  and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. The remaining scenes in the ceiling  they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us. You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God. Maybe he's the savior. Oh  but no  Noah is the one who grew grapes  invented wine  got drunk and passed out naked in his barn. It is a curious way to design the ceiling  now starting out with God creating life  ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. And so  compared with Adam  you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us. But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah  emerald  topaz  scarlet on the prophet Zechariah. Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east  and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination  with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade. You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way  and we follow the mothers and fathers. They are the motors of this great human engine  driving it forward. And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling  the culmination of the whole thing  with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space  encroaching our space. This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure  Jonah  who spent three days in the belly of the whale  for the Christians  is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice  but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day  he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality. All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall  where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment  painted in      after the world had changed again. The Reformation had splintered the Church  the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean. How is a    year old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world  Michelangelo chose to paint destiny  that universal desire  common to all of us  to leave a legacy of excellence. Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment  the end of the world  Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. They have no more covers  no more portraits except for a couple. It's a composition only out of bodies       no two alike  unique like each and every one of us. They start in the lower corner  breaking away from the ground  struggling and trying to rise. Those who have risen reach back to help others  and in one amazing vignette  you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world. The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle. There you find men and women completely nude like athletes. They are the ones who have overcome adversity  and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity  overcome obstacles    they're just like athletes. So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight. Presiding over this assembly is Jesus  first a suffering man on the cross  now a glorious ruler in Heaven. And as Michelangelo proved in his painting  hardship  setbacks and obstacles  they don't limit excellence  they forge it. Now  this does lead us to one odd thing. This is the Pope's private chapel  and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes. But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language  the most universal artistic language he could think of  that of the human body. And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self mastery  he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power. Now  one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did. Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press  complaints about the nudity spread all over the place  and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography  at which point he added two more portraits  one of the man who criticized him  a papal courtier  and the other one of himself as a dried up husk  no athlete  in the hands of a long suffering martyr. The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over  a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory. And so now we stand in the here and now. We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings  in the great  huge totality of the human experience. The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror. Who am I in this picture  Am I one of the crowd  Am I the drunk guy  Am I the athlete  And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty  we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions  Who am I  and what role do I play in this great theater of life  Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Elizabeth Lev  thank you. Elizabeth  you mentioned this whole issue of pornography  too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time. But actually the story is bigger. It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. This work of art was almost destroyed because of that. Elizabeth Lev  The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous. The printing press made sure that everybody saw it. And so  this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks. It was something that happened over the space of    years of editorials and complaints  saying to the Church   You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives. Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel   And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed  it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise  a way to save the painting  and that was in putting up these extra    covers  and that happens to be the origin of fig leafing. That's where it all came about  and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art  not indeed deface or destroyed it. BG  This  what you just gave us  is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel. EL  I don't know  is that an ad  BG  No  no  no  not necessarily  it is a statement. The experience of art today is encountering problems. Too many people want to see this there  and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did. EL  Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look. But also realize  even when you're in those days  with        people a day  even those days when you're in there with all those other people  look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from     years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you  looking upwards with their jaws dropped. It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space. BG  Liz  grazie. EL  Grazie a te. BG  Thank you. Democracy. In the West  we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is  but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism  spectacular growth  while politics remains democracy free. Indeed  democracy is receding in our neck of the woods  here in Europe. Earlier this year  while I was representing Greece    the newly elected Greek government    in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister  I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process    our elections    could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment  I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew  or the Chinese Communist Party  indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. Tonight  here  I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew  the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy    that we need an authentic  boisterous democracy. And without democracy  our societies will be nastier  our future bleak and our great  new technologies wasted. Speaking of waste  allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand    you know it  you recognize it    is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States  Europe  the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations  too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs  like green energy. Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months  in the United States  in Britain and in the Eurozone  we have invested  collectively   .  trillion dollars on all the wealth producing goods    things like industrial plants  machinery  office blocks  schools  roads  railways  machinery  and so on and so forth.   .  trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the   .  trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries  in our financial institutions  doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices. So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks   failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets. The result is stagnant wages  more than a quarter of     to    year olds in America  in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently  low aggregate demand  which in a never ending cycle  reinforces the pessimism of the investors  who  fearing low demand  reproduce it by not investing    exactly like Oedipus' father  who  terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him  unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus  his son  would kill him. This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness  all this idle cash  should be energized to improve lives  to develop human talents  and indeed to finance all these technologies  green technologies  which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth. Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer  I believe so  but before we move on  what do we mean by democracy  Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor  being in the majority  control government. Now  of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women  migrants and  of course  the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded. What was more pertinent  and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy  was the inclusion of the working poor  who not only acquired the right to free speech  but more importantly  crucially  they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision making concerning matters of state. Now  of course  Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly  it burned out quickly. And indeed  our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta  in the      Glorious Revolution  indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor  our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition  which was  after all  a charter for masters. And indeed  liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere  so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere  leaving the economic sphere    the corporate world  if you want    as a democracy free zone. Now  in our democracies today  this separation of the economic from the political sphere  the moment it started happening  it gave rise to an inexorable  epic struggle between the two  with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere  eating into its power. Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be  It's not because their DNA has degenerated. It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power  because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere  which is separate. Indeed  I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it  it is a little bit like a population of predators  that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on  that in the end they starve. Similarly  the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself  causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing  political goods are devaluing  inequality is rising  aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations. So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy  the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth. Clearly  if this is right  we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control  like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants. Now  this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea     years ago and it didn't go very well  did it  The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered  as they were in ancient Athens  without creating new forms of brutality and waste. But there is a solution  eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low wage workers with automata  androids  robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate  automation makes the twin peaks taller  the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper  including    soon  I believe    in places like China. So we need to reconfigure  we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres  but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere  lest we end up with a surveillance mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix  the movie  look like a documentary. So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek like society  where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient  Athenian like  high tech agora. I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take  what would it look like to have this Star Trek like utopia  instead of the Matrix like dystopia  In practical terms  allow me to share just briefly  a couple of examples. At the level of the enterprise  imagine a capital market  where you earn capital as you work  and where your capital follows you from one job to another  from one company to another  and the company    whichever one you happen to work at at that time    is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital  from profits  and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company  no more tug of war between capital and labor  no great gap between investment and saving  indeed  no towering twin peaks. At the level of the global political economy  imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free floating exchange rate  with a universal  global  digital currency  one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund  the G     on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency    let's call it  the cosmos   in units of cosmos    with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit  or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies  especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce. This is not a new idea. It's what  effectively  John Maynard Keynes proposed in      at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then  they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do  especially in the context of a reunified political economic sphere. The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian  in that it prioritizes empowered individuals  Marxist  since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor  and Keynesian  global Keynesian. But above all else  it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy. Will such a world dawn  Or shall we descend into a Matrix like dystopia  The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice  and we'd better make it democratically. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today  Yanis Varoufakis  Well  if there was any relevance in what I just said  then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is    if we don't do it  then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand  what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world  as it is now  it will destabilize not only our democracies  but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water  then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek  that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist  and so is Keynes  so that's why I'm totally confused. BG  Indeed  and possibly we are too  now. YV  If you are not confused  you are not thinking  OK  BG  That's a very  very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say    YV  That was Einstein  actually    BG  During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China  and last night at the speaker dinner  you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that  YV  Well  there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies  we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined  as I was saying in my talk  democracy to the political sphere  while leaving the one sphere where all the action is    the economic sphere    a completely democracy free zone. In a sense  if I am allowed to be provocative  China today is closer to Britain in the   th century. Because remember  we tend to associate liberalism with democracy    that's a mistake  historically. Liberalism  liberal  it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution  especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the   th century  smacks of hypocrisy. BG  I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year. YV  I knew this was coming. BG  Yes. BG  Six months after  how do you look back at the first half of the year  YV  Extremely exciting  from a personal point of view  and very disappointing  because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece  the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive    and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone  which is threatening  massively  the whole of the European Union process. We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program    which by the way  was the first program to manifest that denial    to put it right. And  unfortunately  the powers in the Eurozone  in the Eurogroup  chose to maintain denial. But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive  through political will and through authoritarianism  you may succeed in prolonging it  but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically. BG  What kind of change are you foreseeing  YV  Well  there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone  the Eurozone has no future. BG  Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister  YV  Every day. BG  For example  YV  Anybody who looks back    No  but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance  or of anything else for that matter  who tells you after six months in a job  especially in such a stressful situation  that they have made no mistake  they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes. The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government  just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say   This was a colossal mistake.  BG  Despite all this  and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion  you seem to be remaining quite pro European. YV  Absolutely. Look  my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't  the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic  and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy. We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern     's  which seems to me to be what we are doing  then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non Europeans alike. BG  We definitely hope you are wrong on that point. Yanis  thank you for coming to TED. YV  Thank you. I'm a marine biologist and an explorer photographer with National Geographic  but I want to share a secret. This image is totally incorrect  totally incorrect. I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. All right  the mermaid is indeed real  but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. It's because the ocean is this massive filter  and as soon as you start going underwater  you're going to lose your colors  and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly. But we're humans    we're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision  so we see in red  green and blue  and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye popping color  and we try to bring this eye popping color underwater with us. So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater  and it starts    years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin  who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old school scuba suits  where you're pumping air down to them  and they've got a pontoon of high explosive magnesium powder  and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus  and    boom     a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean  it's a gorgeous image  but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color. And looking at it the other way  what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us  that we've been looking at the blue ocean  and it's a crucible of blue  and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. It's like an underwater light show. Again  what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light. So if you think about it  the ocean is    percent of the planet  and blue light can extend down to almost a       meters. As we go down underwater  after about    meters  all the red is gone. So if you see anything under    meters that's red  it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet. And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. One of the things that they do  one of their miraculous feats  is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins  fluorescent molecules. And in this coral  it could be making up to    percent of its body mass    could be this fluorescent protein. So you wouldn't be making  like     percent muscle and not using it  so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. And for the last        years  this was so special to me  because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science  and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves. So  how do I study this  In order to study biofluorescence  we swim at night. And when I started out  I was just using these blue duct tape filters over my strobe  so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History  and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef  and something happened that just blew me away  this. In the middle of our corals  is this green fluorescent fish. It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. And we're rubbing our eyes  checking the filters  thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera  but the eel was real. It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found  and this just changed my trajectory completely. So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist  John Sparks  and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. And fish are much more interesting than corals  because they have really advanced vision  and some of the fish even have  the way that I was photographing it  they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. So I wanted to seek this out further. So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world  looking for fluorescent life. And it's a bit like  E.T. phone home.  We're out there swimming with this blue light  and we're looking for a response  for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. And eventually  we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. It's a really shy  reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. They're only about the size of my finger  and they spend about   .  percent of their time hidden under a rock. But these eels do come out to mate under full moon nights  and that full moon night translates underwater to blue. Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other  quickly find each other  mate  go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life  like this green fluorescent bream  with its  like  racing stripes along its head and its nape  and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there. After this fish  we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. The only time we've ever seen this  it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral. Later  we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. These lizardfish come in many varieties  and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light  you see lots of patterns  you can really see the differences among them. And in total    we just reported this last year    we found over     species of biofluorescent fish. One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev . He really captures this entrepreneuring  creative spirit in biology. He would design his own gear  make his own cameras  and he was fascinated with the seahorse  Hippocampus erectus  and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. So this is the male seahorse. They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. The males give birth  just phenomenal creatures. So he stayed awake for days. He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him  so he could capture this moment. Now  I wish I could have shown Painlev  the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. And here's our footage. They're the most cryptic fish. You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. They would blend right into the algae  which would also fluoresce red  but they've got great vision  and they go through this long mating ritual  and perhaps they're using it in that effect. But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray  because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class  which includes ... sharks. So I'm  like  a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am. And I was like   Maybe I should go back to corals.  It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. And then we found it. In a deep  dark canyon off the coast of California  we found the first biofluorescent swellshark  right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened  they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube  about twice their size  and wedge themselves under a rock  so they don't get eaten by a predator. And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. Just magnificent    I mean  they're showing these distinct patterns  and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent  but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark. But this is all beautiful to see. I was like  this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark  Can they see this  And we looked in the literature  and nothing was known about this shark's vision. So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University  and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue green interface  probably about     times better than we can see in the dark  but they only see blue green. So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue  creating green. It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. So we have a model  showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. And males and females also have  we're finding  distinct patterns among them. But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now  in the Solomon Islands. Swimming at night  I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles  which  again  this is only one month old  but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. And here in the Solomon Islands  there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left  and this is one of the hotspots for them. So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here  and understand them. In thinking about biofluorescence  I wanted to know  how deep does it go  Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean  So we started using submarines  and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. And we dropped down  and we noticed one important thing    that as we get down to       meters  it drops off. There's no biofluorescent marine life down there  below       meters    almost nothing  it's just darkness. So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. And below       meters  we encountered the bioluminescent zone  where nine out of    animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking. As I try to get deeper  this is slapping on a one person submarine suit    some people call this my  Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen  moment. But as we explore down here  I was thinking about  How do we interact with life delicately  Because we're entering a new age of exploration  where we have to take great care  and we have to set examples how we explore. So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University  and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers  so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military  who  you know  they're not really caring to be gentle. Some corals could be       years old. You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this. At night  I'm in a submarine  I have force feedback gloves  and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine  where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars  and we can conduct our research. Back to the powerful applied applications. Here  you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures  this one from jellyfish and corals  to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition  so we can see our brains better. And even more mind blowing  is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale  who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. So he could see when a single neuron fires. You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures. So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. From deep space  our universe looks like a human brain cell  and then here we are in the deep ocean  and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. And it's my hope that with illuminated minds  we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life  and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy. Thank you. It was an afternoon in the fall of     . I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really  really loved my job  but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged. So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. Chris had been at the ACLU for more than    years  so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights. I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck. I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties    super interesting. But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way  in a way that could really make a difference. So Chris cut right to the chase  and he says   Well  of all the issues you've been looking at  what are the top five    Well  there's genetic discrimination  and reproductive technologies  and biobanking  and ... oh  there's this really cool issue  functional MRI and using it for lie detection  and ... oh  and of course  there's gene patents.   Gene patents    Yes  you know  patents on human genes.   No  You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body  That can't be right.  I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles. And    minutes later  he came bursting in my office.  Oh my god  You're right  Who can we sue   Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer  but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics. I knew something about genetics  but I wasn't even a lawyer  let alone a patent lawyer. So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit. First  we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene. Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims  but the most controversial of these are to so called  isolated DNA     namely  a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell. Gene patent proponents say   See  We didn't patent the gene in your body  we patented an isolated gene.  And that's true  but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated. And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated  but on every possible version of that gene. So what does that mean  That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it  say  to see if it has any mutations  without permission of the patent holder. It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders  often private companies  to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients. Consider Abigail  a    year old with long QT syndrome  a serious heart condition that  if left untreated  can result in sudden death. The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome. But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it. So another lab tried to offer the test  but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement. So as a result  for   years  no test was available. During that time  Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT. Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them  Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases  that certain things are not patent eligible. You can't patent products of nature    the air  the water  minerals  elements of the periodic table. And you can't patent laws of nature    the law of gravity  E   mc . These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none. It seemed to us that DNA  the most fundamental structure of life  that codes for the production of all of our proteins  is both a product of nature and a law of nature  regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube. As we delved into this issue  we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts    scientists  medical professionals  lawyers  patent lawyers. Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy  and  at least in theory  as a matter of law. All of them thought our chances of winning a gene patent challenge were about zero. Why is that  Well  the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than    years. There were literally thousands of patents on human genes. The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo  the biotech industry had grown up around this practice  and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress  and had gone absolutely nowhere. So the bottom line  courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents. Now  neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge  and hearing   Being right just isn't enough   seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. So we set out to build our case. Now  patent cases tend to be  Company A sues Company B over some really narrow  obscure technical issue. We weren't really interested in that kind of case  and we thought this case was much bigger than that. This was about scientific freedom  medical progress  the rights of patients. So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case    more like a civil rights case. We set out to identify a gene patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation. We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics  a company that's based in Salt Lake City  Utah. Myriad held patents on two genes  the BRCA  and the BRCA  genes. Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States. It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop. It charged a lot of money for its test    over       dollars. It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. And perhaps worst of all  for a period of several years  Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France. It has been estimated that during that period  for several years  as many as    percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer    a negative test result that should have been positive. This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age    and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. The family was relieved. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family  and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested. But two years later  Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the    percent who received a false negative test result. Had Eileen received the proper result  Kathleen would have then been tested  and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented. Once we settled on Myriad  we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems. We ended up with    highly committed plaintiffs  genetic counselors  geneticists who had received cease and desist letters  advocacy organizations  four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than         scientists and medical professionals  and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test  or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not  as a result of the patents. One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science. So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention  and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature  we had to explain a couple of basic concepts  like  What's a gene  What's DNA  How is DNA isolated  and why isn't that an invention  We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts  trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately. And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors  like gold. So isolating DNA    it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed. You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold  but you can't patent the gold itself. It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain  you still can't patent it  it's still gold. And the gold  once it's extracted  can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain  you can make jewelry out of it for example    still can't patent the gold  it's still gold. So now it's       and we're ready to file our case. We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York  and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March       Judge Sweet issued his opinion        pages    and a complete victory for our side. In reading the opinion  we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case. I mean  our brief    it was pretty good  but not this good. How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time  We just could not comprehend how this had happened. So it turned out  Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time  was not just a lawyer    he was a scientist. He was not just a scientist    he had a PhD in molecular biology. What an incredible stroke of luck  Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And here things got really interesting. First  in a pivotal moment of this case  the US government switched sides. So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side. But now in direct opposition to its own patent office  the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion  and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. This was a really big deal  totally unexpected. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases  and it has a reputation for being very  very pro patent. So even with this remarkable development  we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision    to  . But the two judges who ruled against us  did so for completely different reasons. The first one  Judge Lourie  made up his own novel  biological theory    totally wrong. He decided Myriad had created a new chemical    made absolutely no sense. Myriad didn't even argue this  so it came out of the blue. The other  Judge Moore  said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature. But she's like   I don't want to shake up the biotech industry.  The third  Judge Bryson  agreed with us. So now we sought review by the Supreme Court. And when you petition the Supreme Court  you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer. Usually these questions take the form of a super long paragraph  like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses   wherein this  and  therefore that.  We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. Four words  Are human genes patentable  Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words  I said   Well  I don't know. I think you have to say  'Is isolated DNA patentable '   Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago.  Well  I certainly couldn't argue with that. The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives  and it agreed to hear ours. The day of the oral argument arrives  and it was really  really exciting    long line of people outside  people had been standing in line since      in the morning to try to get into the courthouse. Two breast cancer organizations  Breast Cancer Action and FORCE  had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps. Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway  moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career. I was clearly more nervous than he was. But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces  our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories  the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical  patient advocacy  environmental and religious organizations  who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case. Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project  including the co discoverer of DNA himself  James Watson  who had submitted a brief to the court  where he referred to gene patenting as  lunacy.  The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake. The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me  the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA  through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges  very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years. Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon. Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree. And in one of my absolutely favorite moments  Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be  just nature sitting there.  We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day  but I could never have anticipated the outcome  nine to zero.  A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature  and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. And furthermore  Myriad did not create anything.  Within    hours of the decision  five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes. Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's. Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering. But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad. It ends a    year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail  Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need. A few weeks after the court issued its decision  I received a small package in the mail. It was from Bob Cook Deegan  a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case. I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal. We took a big risk in taking this case. Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing. The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish  with many twists and turns along the way. A little luck certainly helped  but it was the communities that we bridged  the alliances that we created  that made pigs fly. Thank you. This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. Pleurobot can walk  as you can see here  and as you'll see later  it can also swim. So you might ask  why did we design this robot  And in fact  this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience. Indeed  we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move  and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion. But the more I work in biorobotics  the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion. If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around  or even us as humans  when you go jogging or play tennis  we do amazing things. And in fact  our nervous system solves a very  very complex control problem. It has to coordinate more or less     muscles perfectly  because if the coordination is bad  we fall over or we do bad locomotion. And my goal is to understand how this works. There are four main components behind animal locomotion. The first component is just the body  and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. Then you have the spinal cord  and in the spinal cord you find reflexes  multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. A third component are central pattern generators. These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate  by themselves  very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals. And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain  like the motor cortex  the cerebellum  the basal ganglia  will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion. But what's interesting is to what extent just a low level component  the spinal cord  together with the body  already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken  it can still run for a while  showing that just the lower part  spinal cord and body  already solve a big part of locomotion. Now  understanding how this works is very complex  because first of all  recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult. It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord  because it's protected by the vertebrae. Especially in humans  very hard to do. A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components. So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time. This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help. So what's biorobotics  Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors  like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots. And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain    stairs  mountains  forests  places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job. The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. There are some very nice projects where robots are used  like a scientific tool for neuroscience  for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot. So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean Marie Cabelguen  a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France  and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots. And here we want to start simple. So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys  which are very primitive fish  and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion  like in salamanders  but also in cats and in humans  in mammals. And here  a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models. And in fact  for me  Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true. Like  more or less    years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD. But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. Like  simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground  it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer. Why not have a real robot and real physics  So among all these animals  one of my favorites is the salamander. You might ask why  and it's because as an amphibian  it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming  as you find it in eels or fish  and quadruped locomotion  as you see in mammals  in cats and humans. And in fact  the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate  so it's almost a living fossil  which gives us access to our ancestor  the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods. So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait  so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground  it switches to what's called a walking trot gait. In this case  you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body  and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. Now  one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. So if you take a decerebrated salamander    it's not so nice but you remove the head    and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord  at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking like gait. If you stimulate a bit more  the gait accelerates. And at some point  there's a threshold  and automatically  the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive  as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord  makes a complete switch between two very different gaits. And in fact  the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat  you can switch between walk  trot and gallop. Or in birds  you can make a bird switch between walking  at a low level of stimulation  and flapping its wings at high level stimulation. And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller. So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail  and we had in fact access to a very nice X ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany. And thanks to that  you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail. That's what we did. So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in  D. And what we did is collect a whole database of motions  both on ground and in water  to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do. And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot. So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure  where to place the motors  how to connect them together  to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. And this is how Pleurobot came to life. So let's look at how close it is to the real animal. So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. You can see that we have almost a one to one exact replay of the walking gait. If you go backwards and slowly  you see it even better. But even better  we can do swimming. So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot    and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits. And here  we were very happy  because this is difficult to do. The physics of interaction are complex. Our robot is much bigger than a small animal  so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics. But you see at the end  we have a very close match  and we were very  very happy with this. So let's go to the spinal cord. So here what we did with Jean Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits. And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit  which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey  this primitive eel like fish  and it looks like during evolution  new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs  to do the leg locomotion. And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits. And we tested that on board of a robot. And this is how it looks. So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain. And what's interesting is  by playing with these signals  we can completely control speed  heading and type of gait. For instance  when we stimulate at a low level  we have the walking gait  and at some point  if we stimulate a lot  very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait. And finally  we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle. It just has to worry about this high level modulation  and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles. So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics. So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics  and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion. And we found three important criteria in the properties  basically  of the limbs. The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph like structure. So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel. So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments. A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight. Most of the muscles are in the trunk  which is a good idea  because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly. The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb  so to handle impacts and forces. And this is how we designed Cheetah Cub. So let's invite Cheetah Cub onstage. So this is Peter Eckert  who does his PhD on this robot  and as you see  it's a cute little robot. It looks a bit like a toy  but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. So you see  it's very compliant  very lightweight  and also very elastic  so you can easily press it down and it will not break. It will just jump  in fact. And this very elastic property is also very important. And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph. Now  what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop  meaning no sensors  no complex feedback loops. And that's interesting  because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait  and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion  as you will see in the next video  where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step  and the robot will not fall over  which was a surprise for us. This is a small perturbation. I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over  because there are no sensors  no fast feedback loop. But no  just the mechanics stabilized the gait  and the robot doesn't fall over. Obviously  if you make the step bigger  and if you have obstacles  you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. But what's important here is that just for small perturbation  the mechanics are right. And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience  saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion. Now  how does this relate to human locomotion  Clearly  human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion  but at the same time  the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates. And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans. That's why  if there's a lesion of the spinal cord  this has dramatic effects. The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord. Especially  it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion. So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations. And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that  especially at EPFL. My colleagues Gr goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera  with whom I collaborate. But to do this properly  it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works  how it interacts with the body  and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord. This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Auke  I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim. But for this one  you mentioned in your talk  like a side project  search and rescue  and it does have a camera on its nose. Auke Ijspeert  Absolutely. So the robot    We have some spin off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection  so this robot is now seeing you. And the big dream is to  if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded  and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs  why not send in a robot that can crawl around  swim  walk  with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor. BG  Of course  assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this. AI  Yeah  we should probably change the appearance quite a bit  because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust  I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it. BG  Thank you very much. Thank you and your team. Melati Wijsen  Bali    island of gods. Isabel Wijsen  A green paradise. MW  Or ... a paradise lost. Bali  island of garbage. IW  In Bali  we generate     cubic meters of plastic garbage a day. That's about a    story building. And when it comes to plastic bags  less than five percent gets recycled. MW  We know that changes the image you may have of our island. It changed ours  too  when we learned about it  when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean. And those that don't even make it to the ocean  they're either burned or littered. IW  So we decided to do something about it. And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island. And we have had some significant successes. MW  We are sisters  and we go to the best school on earth  Green School  Bali. Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo  but also in the way that it teaches. We are taught to become leaders of today  something a normal textbook cannot match. IW  One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people  like Nelson Mandela  Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi. Walking home that day  we agreed that we also wanted to be significant. Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant  We wanted to do something now. MW  Sitting on the sofa that night  we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali. And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage. But that is a huge problem. So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids  plastic bags. And the idea was born. IW  We started researching  and let's just say  the more we learned  there was nothing good about plastic bags. And you know what  We don't even need them. MW  We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places  from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin. IW  And so the idea turned into the launch of  Bye Bye Plastic Bags.  MW  In the years that we have been campaigning  we have learned a lot. Lesson number one  you cannot do it all by yourself. You need a big team of like minded kids  and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. The volunteer team includes children from all over the island  from both international and local schools. And together with them  we started a multi layered approach  based on an on  and off line signature petition  educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets  festivals  beach clean ups. And last but not least  we distribute alternative bags  bags like net bags  recycled newspaper bags or     percent organic material bags  all made by local initiatives on the island. IW  We run a pilot village  home of     families. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T shirts  so that helped. We focused on making the customers aware  because that's where the change needs to happen. The village is already two thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free. Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. So we thought   Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures. They can't ignore us  right   MW  Right  IW  But  who would have guessed one million signatures is  like  a thousand times a thousand  We got stuck    till we learned lesson number two  think outside the box. Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles    million arrivals and departures a year. MW  But how do we get into the airport  And here comes lesson number three  persistence. Off we headed to the airport. We got past the janitor. And then it was his boss's boss  and then the assistant office manager  and then the office manager  and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought  well  here comes the janitor again. And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission  we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. And we gave him the  Bali of plastic bags  speech  and being a very nice man  he said   imitating the man's voice   I cannot believe what I'm about say  but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations.  IW  In our first hour and a half there  we got almost       signatures. How cool is that  Lesson number four  you need champions at all levels of society  from students to commercial managers to famous people. And thanks to the attraction of Green School  we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions    even if kids ask nicely. But he promised to spread the word  and now we work closely with the United Nations. MW  Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network. She started with just one Roots   Shoots group and now she has       groups around the world. We are one of them. She's a real inspiration. If you're a fellow Rotarian  nice to meet you. We're Interactors  the youngest department of Rotary International. IW  But we have also learned much about patience  MW  how to deal with frustrations  IW  leadership  MW  teamwork  IW  friendship  MW  we learned more about the Balinese and their culture IW  and we learned about the importance of commitment. MW  It's not always easy. Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk. IW  But last year  we did exactly that. We went to India to give a talk  and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals. Yes  by the end of the tour  when we met our parents again  we both made a decision and said   We're going on a hunger strike   MW  And you can probably imagine their faces. It took a lot of convincing  and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. Isabel and I were serious about doing this. So we met with a nutritionist  and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali. IW  Our  mogak makan   as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia  started. We used social media to support our goal and already on day two  police started to come to our home and school. What were these two girls doing  We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike    we could have gone to jail. But  hey  it worked. Twenty four hours later  we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor. MW  And there he was    waiting for us to meet and speak  being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali. He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags. And we are now friends  and on a regular basis  we remind him and his team of the promises he has made. And indeed  recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by     . IW  Also  at the International Airport of Bali  one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag free policy by     . MW  Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public. IW  Our short term campaign   One Island   One Voice   is all about this. We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag free zone  and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali. And conversely  that highlights those who do not have the sticker. MW  So  why are we actually telling you all of this  Well  partly  it is because we are proud of the results that  together with our team  we have been able to reach. But also because along the way  we have learned that kids can do things. We can make things happen. Isabel and I were only    and    years old when we started this. We never had a business plan  nor a fixed strategy  nor any hidden agendas    just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home. Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs. IW  So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world  go for it  Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it. Us kids may only be    percent of the world's population  but we are     percent of the future. MW  We still have a lot of work to do  but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be Both   Welcome to Bali  do you have nay plastic bags to declare   Om shanti shanti shanti om. Thank you. Code is the next universal language. In the seventies  it was punk music that drove the whole generation. In the eighties  it was probably money. But for my generation of people  software is the interface to our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically  radically more diverse set of people to build those products  to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic  to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist  and so forth. My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of   . I had this mad teenage crush on an older man  and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States  Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow express all of this love  so I built him a website  it's over here. And in       there was no Tumblr  there was no Facebook  there was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving. And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self expression. Just like when I was smaller  I would use crayons and legos. And when I was older  I would use guitar lessons and theater plays. But then  there were other things to get excited about  like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely. Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really  really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like   What   and  Why   and  How   and  What if   And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric  weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as  say  nuclear physics. And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices  protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community  we've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids how the human body works  we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks   So  what is a bubble sort algorithm   Or   How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play ' how does it know which video to show   Or   Linda  is Internet a place   We adults  we grow oddly silent.  It's magic   some of us say.  It's too complicated   the others say. Well  it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened really  really  really fast. Computer scientists built these amazing  beautiful machines  but they made them very  very foreign to us  and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces. And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs  I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting  I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer  but no one knew it. The kids of today  they tap  swipe and pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools to build with computers  we are raising only consumers instead of creators. This whole quest led me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby  she is six years old. She is completely fearless  imaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like   What is object oriented design or what is garbage collection    I would try to imagine how a six year old little girl would explain the problem. And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together. And Ruby also introduced me to her friends  the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard  who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient  but somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes  and so on. In Ruby's world  you learn technology through play. And  for instance  computers are really good at repeating stuff  so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move  it goes   Clap  clap  stomp  stomp clap  clap and jump.  And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times. And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. And most of all  you learn that there are no ready answers. When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world  I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids these four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car  a grocery store  a dog and a toilet. And I would ask   Which one of these do you think is a computer   And the kids would be very conservative and go   None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is  it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time.  But then we would talk and we would discover that actually  a car is a computer  it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog    a dog might not be a computer  but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it. And grocery stores  they have so many different kinds of computers  like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. And kids  you know what  In Japan  toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on off button on them. And I tell the kids   Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer.  And again  the kids go   Sounds really hard  I don't know the right answer for this.  But I tell them   Don't worry  your parents don't know the right answer  either. They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids  you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer.  And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said   This bicycle lamp  if it were a computer  it would change colors.  And I said   That's a really good idea  what else could it do   And she thinks and she thinks  and she goes   If this bicycle lamp were a computer  we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector.  And that's the moment I'm looking for  the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet  that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change. Final story  we also built a computer. And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled our computer together  we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy  he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut. And the boy  he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see  he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application. And his father  the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit  is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth. And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology. Finally  the more approachable  the more inclusive  and the more diverse we make the world of technology  the more colorful and better the world will look like. So  imagine with me  for a moment  a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething year old Silicon Valley boys  but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow  who live in a permanent reality of  s and  s  they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology. They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology that is wonderful  whimsical and a tiny bit weird. When I was a girl  I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley. In the afternoons  I would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings  I would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories  I do them with code. Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic. Thank you. As a boy in Lima  my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa  emperor of the Inca  had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich  and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards  hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca   Where's another civilization we can conquer  Where's more gold   And the Inca  out of vengeance  told them   Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact  there is a city called Paititi    El Dorado in Spanish    made entirely of gold.  The Spanish set off into the jungle  but the few that return come back with stories  stories of powerful shamans  of warriors with poisoned arrows  of trees so tall they blotted out the sun  spiders that ate birds  snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled. All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU  trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential  when I remember this legend  and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist  I asked colleagues from universities  the government  oil  gas and mining companies  and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see  boiling rivers do exist in the world  but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here  which are volcanoes  we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon  nor in most of Peru. So it follows  We should not expect to see a boiling river. Telling this same story at a family dinner  my aunt tells me   But no  Andr s  I've been there. I've swum in that river.  Then my uncle jumps in.  No  Andr s  she's not kidding. You see  you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain  and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt  she's friends with his wife.    C mo     Huh    You know  despite all my scientific skepticism  I found myself hiking into the jungle  guided by my aunt  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center  and well  honestly  mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary  warm stream of the Amazon.  But then ... I heard something  a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing  and as we got closer  I saw smoke  vapor  coming up through the trees. And then  I saw this. I immediately grabbed for my thermometer  and the average temperatures in the river were    degrees C. This is not quite the     degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by  actually  the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre    It starts off as a cold stream. And here  at this site  is the home of the Yacumama  mother of the waters  a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring  mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. The next morning  I woke up and    I asked for tea. I was handed a mug  a tea bag and  well  pointed towards the river. To my surprise  the water was clean and had a pleasant taste  which is a little weird for geothermal systems. What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place  and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it  clean with it  even make their medicines with it. I met the shaman  and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then  to my tremendous relief    I was freaking out  to be honest with you    a smile began to snake across his face  and he just laughed. I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river  on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab  wherever I was in the world  that I pour the waters back into the ground so that  as the shaman said  the waters could find their way back home. I've been back every year since that first visit in       and the fieldwork has been exhilarating  demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts  in between an    degree C river and a hot spring that  well  looked like this  close to boiling. And on top of that  it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh  pouring rain  couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense. Now  after years of work  I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share  today  with all of you here  on the TED stage  for the first time  some of these discoveries. Well  first off  it's not a legend. Surprise  When I first started the research  the satellite imagery was too low resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team  I now have this. Not only that  the indigenous name of the river  Shanay timpishka   boiled with the heat of the sun   indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils  and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us. So why does the river boil  It actually took me three years to get that footage. Fault fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries  so  too  the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface  these earth arteries  we'll get geothermal manifestations  fumaroles  hot springs and in our case  the boiling river. What's truly incredible  though  is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road  think about this. The river flows wider than a two lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for  .   kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage  and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall    and all with near boiling water. We mapped the temperatures along the river  and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry    the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see  the river starts off cold. It then heats up  cools back down  heats up  cools back down  heats up again  and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river. Now  I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists  so to put it in more everyday terms  Everyone loves coffee. Yes  Good. Your regular cup of coffee     degrees C  an extra hot one  well    . So  put in coffee shop terms  the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra hot coffee  and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures. But there's a magic number here that's not being shown  and that number is    degrees C  because that's where things start to hurt  and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature  you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly. I've seen all sorts of animals fall in  and what's shocking to me  is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes  apparently  cook very quickly. They turn this milky white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out  but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power  losing power  until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out. A bit sadistic  aren't we  Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's  again  amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super volcanoes like Yellowstone. But here's the thing  the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin  and again  over     kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center. How can a boiling river exist like this  I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years  and I'm still unable to find another non volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So  still    how does it work  Where do we get this heat  There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system  but from what the data is telling us now  it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system. Basically  it works like this  So  the deeper you go into the earth  the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes  then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient  all due to this unique geologic setting. Now  we found that in and around the river    this is working with colleagues from National Geographic  Dr. Spencer Wells  and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis    we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river  and have found new lifeforms  unique species living in the boiling river. But again  despite all of these studies  all of these discoveries and the legends  a question remains  What is the significance of the boiling river  What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle  And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend  To the shaman and his community  it's a sacred site. To me  as a geoscientist  it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers  it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government  it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development. My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question  one of significance. And the thing there is  we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age  where everything seems mapped  measured and studied  in this age of information  I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data. There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle  where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life. Thank you very much. When I was first learning to meditate  the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath  and when my mind wandered  to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats  sweating through T shirts in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually  it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention  Well  studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something    like maybe this talk    at some point  about half of us will drift off into a daydream  or have this urge to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here  It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily conserved learning processes currently known in science  one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man. This reward based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement  and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good  our brain says   Calories  ... Survival   We eat the food  we taste it    it tastes good. And especially with sugar  our bodies send a signal to our brain that says   Remember what you're eating and where you found it.  We lay down this context dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food  eat food  feel good  repeat. Trigger  behavior  reward. Simple  right  Well  after a while  our creative brains say   You know what  You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. You know  next time you feel bad  why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better   We thank our brains for the great idea  try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad  we feel better. Same process  just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach  this emotional signal    feeling sad    triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years  we were a nerd at school  and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think   Hey  I want to be cool.  So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork  and that was no accident. See cool  smoke to be cool  feel good. Repeat. Trigger  behavior  reward. And each time we do this  we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later  feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now  with these same brain processes  we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains  or trying to force ourselves to pay attention  we instead tapped into this natural  reward based learning process ... but added a twist  What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience  I'll give you an example. In my lab  we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. Now  just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath  they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them had tried this before and failed    on average  six times. Now  with mindfulness training  we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact  we even told them to smoke. What  Yeah  we said   Go ahead and smoke  just be really curious about what it's like when you do.  And what did they notice  Well here's an example from one of our smokers. She said   Mindful smoking  smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals  YUCK   Now  she knew  cognitively that smoking was bad for her  that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. Now  she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones  and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior. Now  the prefrontal cortex  that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective  it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries it's hardest to help us change our behavior  to help us stop smoking  to help us stop eating that second  that third  that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately  this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out  which isn't that helpful. Now  we can all relate to this in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired  even though we know it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline  we fall back into our old habits  which is why this disenchantment is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level    to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested in doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about  Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors  becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance  naturally letting go. This isn't to say that  poof  magically we quit smoking. But over time  as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions  we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity  which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like  It feels good. And what happens when we get curious  We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations    oh  there's tightness  there's tension  there's restlessness    and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge  scary craving that we choke on. In other words  when we get curious  we step out of our old  fear based  reactive habit patterns  and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point. Now  this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study  we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators  we found that parts of a neural network of self referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now  one current hypothesis is that a region of this network  called the posterior cingulate cortex  is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it  when we get sucked in  and it takes us for a ride. In contrast  when we let go    step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening    this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and  ironically  use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking  of stress eating and other addictive behaviors. Now  remember that bit about context dependent memory  We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat  maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored  or you're trying to distract yourself from work  or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving  see if you can tap into this natural capacity  just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message  compulsively text back  feel a little bit better    notice the urge  get curious  feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you. You may never have heard of Kenema  Sierra Leone or Arua  Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth. In hospitals there  there's a community of nurses  physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years  Lassa virus. Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. But these individuals  they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities  and by doing so  protect us all. But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning    these challenging  extraordinary days on the front lines    by singing. They gather together  and they show their joy. They show their spirit. And over the years  from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me  I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it  because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together  we're bonded through a shared humanity. And that of course  as you can imagine  becomes extremely important  even essential  as things begin to change. And that changed a great deal in March of       when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea. This is the first outbreak in West Africa  near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. And it was frightening  frightening for us all. We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought  and we thought it could one day come to Kenema. And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there  and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone. We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus  we knew how to do it  the team is outstanding. We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola. And unfortunately  that day came. On May           a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital  and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. This was an exceptional work that was done. They were able to diagnose the case immediately  to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on. It could've stopped something. But by the time that day came  the outbreak had already been breeding for months. With hundreds of cases  it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks. And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case  but as a tidal wave. We had to work with the international community  with the Ministry of Health  with Kenema  to begin to deal with the cases  as the next week brought     then     then     cases    all coming to Kenema  one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this. And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could  trying to help the individuals  trying to get attention  but we also did one other simple thing. From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola  we can discard it  obviously. The other thing we can do is  actually  put in a chemical and deactivate it  so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean  and that's what we did. We sent it to Boston  where my team works. And we also worked around the clock doing shift work  day after day  and we quickly generated    genomes of the Ebola virus. This is the blueprint    the genome of a virus is the blueprint. We all have one. It says everything that makes up us  and it tells us so much information. The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful. We could actually take these    different viruses  look at them and compare them  and we could see  actually  compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea  we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before  once into the human population  and from there had been transmitting from human to human. Now  that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene  but the important thing is contact tracing. We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans  it was mutating. And each of those mutations are so important  because the diagnostics  the vaccines  the therapies that we're using  are all based on that genome sequence  fundamentally    that's what drives it. And so global health experts would need to respond  would have to develop  to recalibrate everything that they were doing. But the way that science works  the position I was in at that point is  I had the data  and I could have worked in a silo for many  many months  analyzed the data carefully  slowly  submitted the paper for publication  gone through a few back and forths  and then finally when the paper came out  might release that data. That's the way the status quo works. Well  that was not going to work at this point  right  We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help  lots of help. So the first thing we did is  as soon as the sequences came off the machines  we published it to the web. We just released it to the whole world and said   Help us.  And help came. Before we knew it  we were being contacted from people all over  surprised to see the data out there and released. Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community. We were working together in this virtual way  sharing  regular calls  communications  trying to follow the virus minute by minute  to see ways that we could stop it. And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. Everybody  particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally  was reaching out to learn  to participate  to engage. Everybody wants to play a part. The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing  and the Internet connects us all. And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other  that we all just said   Let's do this. Let's work together  and let's make this happen.  But the problem is that the data that all of us are using  Googling on the web  is just too limited to do what we need to do. And so many opportunities get missed when that happens. So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema  we'd had     clinical records from patients  and we once again made that publicly available to the world. And in our own lab  we could show that you could take those     records  we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near     percent accuracy. And we made an app that could release that  to make that available to health care workers in the field. But     is just not enough to make it powerful  to validate it. So we were waiting for more data to release that. and the data has still not come. We are still waiting  tweaking away  in silos rather than working together. And this just    we can't accept that. Right  You  all of you  cannot accept that. It's our lives on the line. And in fact  actually  many lives were lost  many health care workers  including beloved colleagues of mine  five colleagues  Mbalu Fonnie  Alex Moigboi  Dr. Humarr Khan  Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah. These are just five of many health care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked  quietly and separately. See  Ebola  like all threats to humanity  it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves  the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity  Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities  the same strengths  the same fears  the same hopes  I hope that we work together with joy. A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone  and she discovered that the word  Kenema   the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone  is named after the Mende word for  clear like a river  translucent and open to the public gaze.  That was really profound for us  because without knowing it  we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked  we had to work openly  we had to share and we had to work together. And we have to do that. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others    to be open to each other when an outbreak happens  to fight in this fight together. Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola  it will not be the last  and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait  like Lassa virus and others. And the next time this happens  it could happen in a city of millions  it could start there. It could be something that's transmitted through the air. It could even be disseminated intentionally. And I know that that is frightening  I understand that  but I know also  and this experience shows us  that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing  to win this and have the upper hand over viruses. But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy. So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always  let us be in this fight with them always. And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus  but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity. Thank you. Hello. My name is Matthew Williams  and I am a champion. I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada  competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage. I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating  work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport. By the way  all that is through Special Olympics. Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments  The world does not see all people like me as champions. Not long ago  people like me were shunned and hidden away. There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in       but in too many cases  people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population. People use the r word in front of me  and they think it doesn't matter. That's the word  retard  or  retarded  used in a derogatory manner. They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends. I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case. I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities  or  too often  how they don't see them at all. Did you know the World Games happened this year  I was one of over       athletes with intellectual disabilities from     countries who competed in LA. There was over        spectators watching opening ceremonies  and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. Did you even know that happened  What do you think of when you see someone like me  I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals. Special Olympics transforms the self identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching. For those of you who aren't familiar  Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics. We offer high quality  year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions. This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities. I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Growing up  I played hockey until I was    years old. The older I got  the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else  and I was angry and frustrated. For a while  I did not play any sports  didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad. There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society. No one thought they could participate in sports  let alone be a valued member of society. In the     s  Dr. Frank Hayden  a scientist at the University of Toronto  was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities. Using rigorous scientific research  Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer. Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities. But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver  the founder of Special Olympics  persevered  and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over. Before I joined Special Olympics  I was nervous because I was young  shy  not confident and didn't have many friends. When I got there  though  everyone was very encouraging  supportive  and let me be myself without being judged. Now  I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial  national games  and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA  where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games. I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe  and I've heard so many similar stories. Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity. Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs. Studies have shown that  on average  men with intellectual disabilities die    years younger than men without  and women with intellectual disabilities die    years younger than women without. Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport. Also  our coaches teach us about nutrition and health. Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care. At the      World Summer Games  my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team. The day before our game  the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening  where seven of    members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time. The change in them was amazing. They were more excited  happy and confident  because their coach could vocally communicate with them. And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball  the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands    sounds that we take for granted. Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field. This year  research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability  and the    percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive. Then there's the r word  proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people. People use it as a casual term or an insult. It was tweeted more than nine million times last year  and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet. People don't think it's insulting  but it is. As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r word as an insult   Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you walk away with your heart unchanged.  This year  at the      World Summer Games  people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition. So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett  the Newfoundland Moose  deadlifted     pounds and lifted     pounds in the squat    setting huge new records for Special Olympics. Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland    not just Special Olympics  all powerlifters. Jackie was a huge star in LA  and ESPN live tweeted his record breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance. Fifty years ago  few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that. This year         spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from     countries around the world. Far from being hidden away  we were cheered and celebrated. Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves. Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion. Now  I have dreams and achievements in my sport  great coaches  respect and dignity  better health  and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer. I am no longer hidden  bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk. The world is a different place because of Special Olympics  but there is still farther to go. So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability  I hope you will see their ability. The next time someone uses the r word near you  I hope you will tell them how much it hurts. I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics. I would like to leave you with one final thought. Nelson Mandela said   Sports has the power to change the world.  Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident  meet friends  not be judged and get to feel like and be champions. Thank you very much. Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time. Of course there are other challenges    health care  disease burdens and pandemics  environmental challenges and  of course  radicalized terrorism. However  to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge  it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated. More importantly  unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable  long term economic growth  we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today  whether it's health care  education or economic development. The fundamental question is this  How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis  They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth  capital  labor and productivity. In particular  these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits  the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling. In a similar vein  how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets  where    percent of the world's population lives and where  on average     percent of the population is under the age of     In these countries  it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today  the largest emerging economies    countries with at least    million people    continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that  countries like India  Russia  South Africa  Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and  in many cases  actually regressing. Economic growth matters. With economic growth  countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility  opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth  countries contract and atrophy  not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes  the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises  and societies become dimmer  coarser and smaller. The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries. Now  I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have    billion people on the planet before it plateaus in       you're concerned about what that does to natural resources    arable land  potable water  energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man  embodied in the corporate globalist  has become greedy and corrupt. But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly  it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism. The definition of capitalism  very simply put  is that the factors of production  such as trade and industry  capital and labor  are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state. It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term  we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance. Economic growth needs capitalism  but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago  the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this  however  is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism  good  non capitalism  bad. When in practical experience  capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China  which have practiced more state capitalism  and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist. Our efforts to critique the capitalist system  however  have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism. However  there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism  particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and  worse still  it's increasing income inequality    the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many. The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills. In order to think about that framing  we have to ask ourselves  how does capitalism work today  Very simplistically  capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer    a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course  in this system governments do tax  and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs  recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless  this framework    this two stage framework    is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model. I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all  we can draw on the right wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism. In particular  right leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers  where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example  sending children to school  parents could earn money for that  or getting their children inoculated or immunized  parents could get paid for doing that. Now  quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway  the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico  in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York. But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs  albeit small in scale  are moving in that right direction. Of course  left leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government  NGOs and private sector. Two very good examples of this are the   th century United States  when the infrastructure rollout was really about public private partnerships. More recently  of course  the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society. My fundamental message to you is this  We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable  long term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today  we're going to have to be more broad minded about what might work. Ultimately  we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  I want to ask a couple of questions  Dambisa  because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology  it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way  DM  Well  I think that that's completely legitimate  and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world. BG  So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth  but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth  to take us on a long journey  is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening  DM  Well  I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite  scarce and depleting resources that we know today  we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is. However  we've seen the Club of Rome  we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources  and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think  with ingenuity we could see desalination  I think we could reinvest in energy  so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense  I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do. BG  The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism    with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting  DM  I'm suggesting we have to be open minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world  the United States  has democracy  liberal democracy  as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism    to the extent that it is free    free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism  which is a completely different model. These two countries  completely different political models and completely different economic models  and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient. I think those are the debates we should have  because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting  and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know. BG  One last question. The COP   is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there  what would you say  DM  Again  I would be very much about being open minded. As you're aware  the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now    in Copenhagen  '   in Stockholm    and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement  in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real  important responsibility not only just to manage their CO  emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world  but also as trendsetters in R D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence  it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets. BG  Dambisa  thank you for coming to TED. DM  Thank you very much. We've evolved with tools  and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes  .  million years ago  shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand. However  over the years  tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use  and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex  we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things  such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture. But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However  computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem  because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that  then  we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford. So with my colleagues  Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii  we created inFORM  where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize  D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application  the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information  by making it physical. So the question is  how can we use this  Traditionally  urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab  we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it  but it's dynamic  it's physical  and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views  such as population or traffic information  but it's made physical. We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person  I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects  and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM  you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands  allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on  D data sets as well  so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of  D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects  and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places  so as I move a ball on one side  the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect. Now  you might be wondering how does this all work  and essentially  what it is  is     linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN  but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor  a single linear actuator  and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having     of something is that you have to do every step     times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do  research     and had late nights watching movies  eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know    research. But anyway  I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly  we're using mobile devices  and we interact on the go. But mobile devices  just like computers  are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone  to surf the web  to play games  to take pictures or even a million different things. But again  they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices. So at Stanford  we created this haptic edge display  which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape  so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding    small  tiny linear actuators inside the device  and that allow you not only to touch them but also back drive them as well. But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab  we created this new high resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch input device to a phone. And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller  and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode. So  where does this point  How do we move forward from here  I think  really  where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things  where we have computers everywhere    they're in our pockets  they're in our walls  they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments  And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically  and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks  So for the Milan Design Week  we created TRANSFORM  which is an interactive table scale version of these shape displays  which can move physical objects on the surface  for example  reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work  then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over  it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals. So  in conclusion  I really think that we need to think about a new  fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands  and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward  I think we need to go beyond this  beyond devices  to really think about new ways that we can bring people together  and bring our information into the world  and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that  I will leave you. Thank you very much. On January           a band of al Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. There  they set fire to a medieval library of        manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography  history to medicine  including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction. Unknown in the West  this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent  the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all. The mayor of Bamako  who witnessed the event  called the burning of the manuscripts  a crime against world cultural heritage.  And he was right    or he would have been  if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying. In fact  just before  African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn. Today  the collection lies hidden in Bamako  the capital of Mali  moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy  this time by climate. But Africa  and the far flung corners of the world  are not the only places  or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy. Several years ago  I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that  at the barest minimum  there are        manuscripts pre      that are illegible because of water damage  fading  mold and chemical reagents. The real number is likely double that  and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps. What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works  Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past. Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature  history  philosophy  music    or  more provocatively  that could rewrite our cultural identities  building new bridges between people and culture. These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar  a reader of texts  into a textual scientist. What an unsatisfying word  reader  is. For me  it conjures up images of passivity  of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel. How much better to be a participant in the past  an adventurer in an undiscovered country  searching for the hidden text. As an academic  I was a mere reader. I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years    Virgil  Ovid  Chaucer  Petrarch    and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever diminishing slivers of insight. What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past  a discoverer of literature  an Indiana Jones without the whip    or  actually  with the whip. And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well. And so six years ago  I changed the direction of my career. At the time  I was working on  The Chess of Love   the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited. And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost. For five years  I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me. And so I did what many people do. I went online  and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a   th century palimpsest. A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten. And so  out of the blue  I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project  Professor Roger Easton  with a plan and a plea. And to my surprise  he actually wrote back. With his help  I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable  multispectral imaging lab  And with this lab  I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic. So how does multispectral imaging actually work  Well  the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate  that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there. The same is true with invisible writing. Our system uses    wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared  and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs  and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript. Up to    images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz. There are about five of these in the world. And once we capture these images  we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them  using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA. The results can be spectacular. You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls  which are slowly gelatinizing. Using infrared  we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. You may not be aware  however  of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy. Here  for example  is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged  which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world. The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin  and it dates from the first half of the fourth century. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine  and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea  when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon. This manuscript  unfortunately  has been very badly damaged  and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church. In fact  that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus  which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis. Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in     years. Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed  however  is only part of the solution. The technology is expensive and very rare  and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions. That's why I founded the Lazarus Project  a not for profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever. Over the past five years  our team of imaging scientists  scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts  included the Vercelli Book  which is the oldest book of English  the Black Book of Carmarthen  the oldest book of Welsh  and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia. So  spectral imaging can recover lost texts. More subtly  though  it can recover a second story behind every object  the story of how  when and by whom a text was created  and  sometimes  what the author was thinking at the time he wrote. Take  for example  a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand  which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress. Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten. The word overwritten was  citizens.  Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.  Subjects.  There  ladies and gentlemen  is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson. Or consider the      Martellus Map  which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located. The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large  nearly seven foot map  made the world look like a giant desert. Until now  we had very little idea  detailed idea  that is  of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented. The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light. Ultraviolet did very little for it. Multispectral gave us everything. In Asia  we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body. In Africa  about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke. Like starlight  which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past  so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens  we witness the mistakes  the changes of mind  the na vet s  the uncensored thoughts  the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real  that make history closer to us. What about the future  There's so much of the past  and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever. That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call  textual science.  Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar    the ability to read old languages and old handwriting  the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them    with new techniques like imaging science  the chemistry of inks and pigments  computer aided optical character recognition. Last year  a student in my class  a freshman  with a background in Latin and Greek  was image processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome. As he worked  tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text. Everyone gathered around  and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud. In that moment  he became a scholar. Ladies and gentlemen  that is the future of the past. Thank you very much. So I come from the tallest people on the planet    the Dutch. It hasn't always been this way. In fact  all across the globe  people have been gaining height. In the last     years  in developed countries  on average  we have gotten    centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is  but almost all of them involve nutrition  namely the increase of dairy and meat. In the last    years  global meat consumption has more than quadrupled  from    million tons to     million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen  so has protein consumption. And we know that globally  we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise  so is our global population  from   billion of us today to  .  billion by       which means that by       we are going to need at least    percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number  by the end of this century  at    billion  which means that we are going to need a lot more protein. This challenge is staggering    so much so  that recently  a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems  our societies might actually collapse in the next    years. Currently  our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over  .  billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time  our global fisheries are two and a half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support  meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace. WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last    years  our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species  such as swordfish and bluefin tuna  over    percent has disappeared since the     s. And there are a lot of great  sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better managed fisheries. But ultimately  all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely  even with the best managed fisheries  that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today. We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce  we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population. So how do we fix this  What's the world going to look like in just    short years when there's  .  billion more of us sharing the same resources  We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea  but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally. People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path  failing to meet demands. The World Health Organization recently reported that     million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage  which is due to that same growing  global population and the declining access to resources like water  energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest  riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry  and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so  so many reasons  we need to change our global food production systems. We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture    the farming of fish  plants like seaweed  shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said   We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about    farming instead of hunting.  Fish is the last food that we hunt. And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like   Life's too short for farmed fish   or   Wild caught  of course   over fish that we know virtually nothing about  We don't know what it ate during its lifetime  and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species  it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal. But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy  it prevents heart disease  it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega  s  which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy  it's also a lot more exciting and diverse. Think about it    most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow  sheep is sheep  pig's pig  and poultry    turkey  duck  chicken    pretty much sums it up. And then there's     species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves  but that's beside that point. And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us  good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish obsessed    Let me explain  My brilliant partner and wife  Amy Novograntz  and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle  who won the TED Prize in     . We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director  me  an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen  love to dive  passion for the oceans. Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love  got married and we came away really inspired  thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation    something that was meant to last  that could make a real difference and something that we could do together. Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat  we got to a meeting at Conservation International  where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture  asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it  realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need. We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right. And to talk about stats    right now  the amount of fish consumed globally  wild catch and farmed combined  is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined  small and large  across the globe  together produce about    million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption. Aquaculture this year  for the first time in history  actually produces more than what we catch from the wild. But now this  Demand is going to go up. In the next    years  we are going to need an additional    million tons to meet demand  which is one and a half times as much  almost  as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number. It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming    for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive  so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost       liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water. And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water    planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet. And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed  and depending on species  even less. And why is that  Well  that's because fish  first of all  float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold blooded    they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills. And it needs very little water  which is counterintuitive  but as we say  it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource efficient animal protein available to humankind  aside from insects. How much we've learned since. For example  on top of that    million tons that's annually caught for human consumption  there's an additional    million tons caught for animal feed  mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil. This is madness. Sixty five percent of these fisheries  globally  are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently  an article came out of Stanford saying that if    percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal  our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute. Now  we know that the oceans have far more problems    they have pollution  there's acidification  coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries  and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries  aquaculture  deforestation  climate change  food security and so on. In the search for alternatives  the industry  on a massive scale  has reverted to plant based alternatives like soy  industrial chicken waste  blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on. And we understand where these choices come from  but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable  it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean  Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else  it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore  it has no way to digest soy. Now  fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals  there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations  ecosystem destruction and pollution  escaped fish breeding with wild populations  altering the overall genetic pool  and then of course  as just mentioned  the unsustainable feed ingredients. How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate  whatever it was. Once you know  you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust  that produces healthy food. But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues. I think of agriculture before the green revolution    we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural  with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes  insects  seaweeds and micro algae. Healthy for the people  healthy for the fish  healthy for the planet. Microbes  for example  can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal    at scale. Insects are the    well  first of all  the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste  but second  think of fly fishing  and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers. This revolution is starting as we speak  it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled  natural conditions  creating happy fish. I imagine  for example  a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming  where you can produce healthy  happy  delicious fish with little or no effluent  almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to    species next to each other    off of each other  mimicking nature. You need very little feed  very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish  for example. There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore  to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry  so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms  so we can improve farm practices. There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake    all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow  there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing. So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years  and that's what we need to be working on together    rethinking everything from the ground up  with a holistic view across the value chain  connecting all these things across the globe  alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision. Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young  much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task  but not as far fetched as you might think. It's possible. So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal  it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life. We need to have a meal that we can trust  live long lives. And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe    this is for all of us. Even in the poorest countries  it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same. The day will come where people will realize    no  demand    farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy    and refuse anything less. You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from  Who raised it  and what did it eat  Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing. So every time you order  ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually  they will listen. And all of us will benefit. Thank you.    years ago  I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test. When I arrived at the clinic to be tested  I was handed a questionnaire. One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race  White  black  Asian  or Native American. I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds  In that case  I would answer with my social identity  and check the box for  black.  But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits  In that case  wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry  which is just as much European as African  And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman  After all  I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons. Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes. Well  despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity  I was told   Don't worry about it  just put down however you identify yourself.  So I check  black   but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically. That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking  Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions  Well  I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. It shapes physicians' diagnoses  measurements  treatments  prescriptions  even the very definition of diseases. And the more I found out  the more disturbed I became. Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction. When we identify people as black  white  Asian  Native American  Latina  we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar  I've also studied how lawmakers  not biologists  have invented the legal definitions of races. And it's not just the view of social scientists. You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June       President Bill Clinton famously declared   I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms  human beings  regardless of race  are more than   .  percent the same.  And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes. Francis Collins  who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH  echoed President Clinton.  I am happy that today  the only race we're talking about is the human race.  Doctors are supposed to practice evidence based medicine  and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution. But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind. Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate  or GFR. Doctors routinely interpret GFR  this important indicator of kidney function  by race. As you can see in this lab test  the exact same creatinine level  the concentration in the blood of the patient  automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African American. Why  I've been told it's based on an assumption that African Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races. But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder  Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them  Well  doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors  like muscle mass  enzyme level  genetic traits they just don't have time to look for. But race is a bad proxy. In many cases  race adds no relevant information at all. It's just a distraction. But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures. It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms  family illnesses  their history  their own illnesses they might have    all more evidence based than the patient's race. Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well being. Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account  but there are numerous medical tests  like the GFR  that use race categorically to treat black  white  Asian patients differently just because of their race. Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain  exaggerate their pain  and are predisposed to drug addiction. The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self identified African American patients. A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics  but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients. The FDA then allowed the company  the drug company  to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African American subjects. It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs. But think about the dangerous message it sent  that black people's bodies are so substandard  a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients. In the end  the drug company's marketing scheme failed. For one thing  black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted   Give me what the white people are taking   And if you find race specific medicine surprising  wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era  a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery. Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War  and he was a well known expert on what was then called  Negro medicine.  He promoted the racial concept of disease  that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the     s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites  forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal   It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control  and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom.  To support this theory  Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs. Today  doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled  race  so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well known function called  correcting for race.  The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health  lack of access to high quality medical care  food deserts in poor neighborhoods  exposure to environmental toxins  high rates of incarceration  and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination. You see  race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences  but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health. Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race specific pill. It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them. The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about  there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race. Would you imagine with me  just a moment  What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race  Suppose they rejected an   th century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity  that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races  What if  instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor  doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor  What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism  not by genetic difference  Race medicine is bad medicine  it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity. It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. So I'm a neurosurgeon. And like most of my colleagues  I have to deal  every day  with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body  the brain has very little ability for self repair. And after a major injury of your central nervous system  the patients often remain with a severe handicap. And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon. What is a functional neurosurgeon  It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation  where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease  with severe tremor  with severe pain. However  neuromodulation does not mean neuro repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream. And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help  the brain is able to help itself. So the story started    years ago. At that time  I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room. I often had to take care of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma  his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life  you have to decrease this intracranial pressure. And to do that  you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain  we decided with Jean Fran ois Brunet  who is a colleague of mine  a biologist  to study them. What do I mean by that  We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue. It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family. So you need to find the right nutrients  the warmth  the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive. So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells. And after many attempts  Jean Fran ois did it. And that's what he saw under his microscope. And that was  for us  a major surprise. Why  Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture  with large green cells surrounding small  immature cells. And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells  able to turn into any type of cell of the body. The adult brain has stem cells  but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater. And there was another intriguing observation  Regular stem cells are very active cells    cells that divide  divide  divide very quickly. And they never die  they're immortal cells. But these cells behave differently. They divide slowly  and after a few weeks of culture  they even died. So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently. And it took us a long time to understand where they came from. They come from these cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin positive cells. All of you have them in your brain. They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. When you were fetuses  they helped your brain to fold itself. But why do they stay in your head  This  we don't know. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. But it's not so sure. But there is one clear thing    that from these cells  we got our stem cell culture. And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain. And we had to prove this. So to prove it  we decided to design an experimental paradigm. The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non eloquent area of the brain  and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean Fran ois did it in his lab. And then label them  to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain. And the last step was to re implant them in the same individual. We call these autologous grafts    autografts. So the first question we had   What will happen if we re implant these cells in a normal brain  and what will happen if we re implant the same cells in a lesioned brain   Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller  we worked with monkeys. So in the first case scenario  we re implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks  as if they were taken from the brain  they go back home  the space is already busy  they are not needed there  so they disappear. In the second case scenario  we performed the lesion  we re implanted exactly the same cells  and in this case  the cells remained    and they became mature neurons. And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope. Those are the cells that were re implanted. And the proof they carry  these little spots  those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro  when they were in culture. But we could not stop here  of course. Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion  So for that  we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task. They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray. They were very good at it. And when they had reached a plateau of performance  we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion. So the monkeys were plegic  they could not move their hand anymore. And exactly the same as humans would do  they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent  exactly the same as after a stroke. Patients are completely plegic  and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism  they recover to a certain extent  exactly the same for the monkey. So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery  we implanted his own cells. So on the left side  you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered. He's at about    to    percent of his previous performance before the lesion. He's not so accurate  not so quick. And look now  when we re impant the cells  Two months after re implantation  the same individual. It was also very exciting results for us  I tell you. Since that time  we've understood much more about these cells. We know that we can cryopreserve them  we can use them later on. We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models  like Parkinson's disease  for example. But our dream is still to implant them in humans. And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Jocelyne  this is amazing  and I'm sure that right now  there are several dozen people in the audience  possibly even a majority  who are thinking   I know somebody who can use this.  I do  in any case. And of course the question is  what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials  Jocelyne Bloch  The biggest obstacles are regulations.  Laughs  So  from these exciting results  you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials. BG  Which is understandable  the brain is delicate  etc. JB  Yes  it is  but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it  you know  BG  If you project yourself    having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials  if you project yourself out in time  how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available  JB  So  it's very difficult to say. It depends  first  on the approval of the trial. Will the regulation allow us to do it soon  And then  you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients. So it takes  already  a long time to select the patients  do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial. You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody. BG  And safe  of course. JB  Of course. BG  Jocelyne  thank you for coming to TED and sharing this. BG  Thank you. All right  I want to see a show of hands  how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion  childcare  food  And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them  You know  it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation  we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in  My Fair Lady   Stick to the weather and your health. But these days  with climate change and anti vaxxing  those subjects    are not safe either. So this world that we live in  this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument  where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it  it's not normal. Pew Research did a study of        American adults  and they found that at this moment  we are more polarized  we are more divided  than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise  which means we're not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live  who to marry and even who our friends are going to be  based on what we already believe. Again  that means we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening  and somewhere along the way  we lost that balance. Now  part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research  about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them  almost most of them  are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this   I came to realize...   I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens  but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills. It might sound like a funny question  but we have to ask ourselves  Is there any   st century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent  confident conversation   Now  I make my living talking to people  Nobel Prize winners  truck drivers  billionaires  kindergarten teachers  heads of state  plumbers. I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like. I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level. But I still have a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next    minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this  things like look the person in the eye  think of interesting topics to discuss in advance  look  nod and smile to show that you're paying attention  repeat back what you just heard or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. Now  I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So  I'm going to teach you how to interview people  and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time  without getting bored  and  please God  without offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before. We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired  or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that. So I have    basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them  but honestly  if you just choose one of them and master it  you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one  Don't multitask. And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand. I mean  be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss. Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out of the conversation  get out of the conversation  but don't be half in it and half out of it. Number two  Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth  write a blog. Now  there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show  Because they're really boring. If they're conservative  they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal  they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance  the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again  assume that you have something to learn. Bill Nye   Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't.  I put it this way  Everybody is an expert in something. Number three  Use open ended questions. In this case  take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who  what  when  where  why or how. If you put in a complicated question  you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you   Were you terrified   you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence  which is  terrified   and the answer is  Yes  I was  or  No  I wasn't.   Were you angry    Yes  I was very angry.  Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like   What was that like    How did that feel   Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it  and you're going to get a much more interesting response. Number four  Go with the flow. That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere  or it's already been answered. That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question  and he was just bound and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having a conversation with someone  and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. And we stop listening. Stories and ideas are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five  If you don't know  say that you don't know. Now  people on the radio  especially on NPR  are much more aware that they're going on the record  and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six  Don't equate your experience with theirs. If they're talking about having lost a family member  don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work  don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And  more importantly  it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was  and he said   I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers.  Conversations are not a promotional opportunity. Number seven  Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending  and it's really boring  and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids  we have a point to make  so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that. Number eight  Stay out of the weeds. Frankly  people don't care about the years  the names  the dates  all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like  what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine  This is not the last one  but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most  the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said  and I'm paraphrasing   If your mouth is open  you're not learning.  And Calvin Coolidge said   No man ever listened his way out of a job.  Why do we not listen to each other  Number one  we'd rather talk. When I'm talking  I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason  We get distracted. The average person talks at about     word per minute  but we can listen at up to     words per minute. So our minds are filling in those other     words. And look  I know  it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone  but if you can't do that  you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said   Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.  One more rule  number     and it's this one  Be brief.  A good conversation is like a miniskirt  short enough to retain interest  but long enough to cover the subject.    My Sister  All of this boils down to the same basic concept  and it is this one  Be interested in other people. You know  I grew up with a very famous grandfather  and there was kind of a ritual in my home. People would come over to talk to my grandparents  and after they would leave  my mother would come over to us  and she'd say   Do you know who that was  She was the runner up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer.  And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden  amazing thing about them. And honestly  I think it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can  I keep my mind open  and I'm always prepared to be amazed  and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out  talk to people  listen to people  and  most importantly  be prepared to be amazed. Thanks. So a while ago  I tried an experiment. For one year  I would say yes to all the things that scared me. Anything that made me nervous  took me out of my comfort zone  I forced myself to say yes to. Did I want to speak in public  No  but yes. Did I want to be on live TV  No  but yes. Did I want to try acting  No  no  no  but yes  yes  yes. And a crazy thing happened  the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear  made it not scary. My fear of public speaking  my social anxiety  poof  gone. It's amazing  the power of one word.  Yes  changed my life.  Yes  changed me. But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way  in a way I never imagined  and it started with a question from my toddler. I have these three amazing daughters  Harper  Beckett and Emerson  and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as  honey.  as though she's a Southern waitress.  Honey  I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup.  The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere  and I said   Yes.  And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family. I made a vow that from now on  every time one of my children asks me to play  no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going  I say yes  every single time. Almost. I'm not perfect at it  but I try hard to practice it. And it's had a magical effect on me  on my children  on our family. But it's also had a stunning side effect  and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it  that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career. See  I have what most people would call a dream job. I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living. Dream job. No. I'm a titan. Dream job. I create television. I executive produce television. I make television  a great deal of television. In one way or another  this TV season  I'm responsible for bringing about    hours of programming to the world. Four television programs     hours of TV    Three shows in production at a time  sometimes four. Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before. The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars. Let's just say five. A new episode made every nine days times four shows  so every nine days that's    million dollars worth of television  four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four     episodes going on at all times     episodes of  Grey's      episodes of  Scandal      episodes of  How To Get Away With Murder      episodes of  The Catch   that's    hours of TV  that's     million dollars for a season. In America  my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night. Around the world  my shows air in     territories in    languages for an audience of    million people. My brain is global  and    hours of that    hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced  so on top of everything else  I need to find time  real quiet  creative time  to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four      million dollars  campfires burning all over the world. You know who else is doing that  Nobody  so like I said  I'm a titan. Dream job. Now  I don't tell you this to impress you. I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word  writer.  I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard  whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home  take me seriously when I talk about working  so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day  so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming. It's all job  all work  all reality  all blood  all sweat  no tears. I work a lot  very hard  and I love it. When I'm hard at work  when I'm deep in it  there is no other feeling. For me  my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air. It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas. It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon. It is being Beyonc . And it is all of those things at the same time. I love working. It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious  and what makes it all so good is the hum. There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good. A hum begins in my brain  and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road  and I could drive it forever. And a lot of people  when I try to explain the hum  they assume that I'm talking about the writing  that my writing brings me joy. And don't get me wrong  it does. But the hum    it wasn't until I started making television that I started working  working and making and building and creating and collaborating  that I discovered this thing  this buzz  this rush  this hum. The hum is more than writing. The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug. The hum is music. The hum is light and air. The hum is God's whisper right in my ear. And when you have a hum like that  you can't help but strive for greatness. That feeling  you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost. That's called the hum. Or  maybe it's called being a workaholic. Maybe it's called genius. Maybe it's called ego. Maybe it's just fear of failure. I don't know. I just know that I'm not built for failure  and I just know that I love the hum. I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan  and I know that I don't want to question it. But here's the thing  the more successful I become  the more shows  the more episodes  the more barriers broken  the more work there is to do  the more balls in the air  the more eyes on me  the more history stares  the more expectations there are. The more I work to be successful  the more I need to work. And what did I say about work  I love working  right  The nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note  the hum  the hum  the hum. I like that hum. I love that hum. I need that hum. I am that hum. Am I nothing but that hum  And then the hum stopped. Overworked  overused  overdone  burned out. The hum stopped. Now  my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan. Harper tells people   My mom won't be there  but you can text my nanny.  And Emerson says   Honey  I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand.  They're children of a titan. They're baby titans. They were        and   when the hum stopped. The hum of the engine died. I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine. The hum would not come back. My hum was broken. I was doing the same things I always did  all the same titan work     hour days  working straight through the weekends  no regrets  never surrender  a titan never sleeps  a titan never quits  full hearts  clear eyes  yada  whatever. But there was no hum. Inside me was silence. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time  sometimes four. Four television programs     hours of TV  three shows in production at a time ... I was the perfect titan. I was a titan you could take home to your mother. All the colors were the same  and I was no longer having any fun. And it was my life. It was all I did. I was the hum  and the hum was me. So what do you do when the thing you do  the work you love  starts to taste like dust  Now  I know somebody's out there thinking   Cry me a river  stupid writer titan lady.  But you know  you do  if you make  if you work  if you love what you do  being a teacher  being a banker  being a mother  being a painter  being Bill Gates  if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum  if you know the hum  if you know what the hum feels like  if you have been to the hum  when the hum stops  who are you  What are you  What am I  Am I still a titan  If the song of my heart ceases to play  can I survive in the silence  And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question. I'm on my way out the door  I'm late  and she says   Momma  wanna play   And I'm just about to say no  when I realize two things. One  I'm supposed to say yes to everything  and two  my Southern waitress didn't call me  honey.  She's not calling everyone  honey  anymore. When did that happen  I'm missing it  being a titan and mourning my hum  and here she is changing right before my eyes. And so she says   Momma  wanna play   And I say   Yes.  There's nothing special about it. We play  and we're joined by her sisters  and there's a lot of laughing  and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops. Nothing out of the ordinary. And yet  it is extraordinary  because in my pain and my panic  in the homelessness of my humlessness  I have nothing to do but pay attention. I focus. I am still. The nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note does not exist. All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of. It's all peace and simplicity. The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe. I can barely believe I'm breathing. Play is the opposite of work. And I am happy. Something in me loosens. A door in my brain swings open  and a rush of energy comes. And it's not instantaneous  but it happens  it does happen. I feel it. A hum creeps back. Not at full volume  barely there  it's quiet  and I have to stay very still to hear it  but it is there. Not the hum  but a hum. And now I feel like I know a very magical secret. Well  let's not get carried away. It's just love. That's all it is. No magic. No secret. It's just love. It's just something we forgot. The hum  the work hum  the hum of the titan  that's just a replacement. If I have to ask you who I am  if I have to tell you who I am  if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is  I have forgotten what the real hum is. The hum is not power and the hum is not work specific. The hum is joy specific. The real hum is love specific. The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life. The real hum is confidence and peace. The real hum ignores the stare of history  and the balls in the air  and the expectation  and the pressure. The real hum is singular and original. The real hum is God's whisper in my ear  but maybe God was whispering the wrong words  because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan  It's just love. We could all use a little more love  a lot more love. Any time my child asks me to play  I will say yes. I make it a firm rule for one reason  to give myself permission  to free me from all of my workaholic guilt. It's a law  so I don't have a choice  and I don't have a choice  not if I want to feel the hum. I wish it were that easy  but I'm not good at playing. I don't like it. I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work. The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face. I don't like playing. I work all the time because I like working. I like working more than I like being at home. Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle  because what kind of person likes working more than being at home  Well  me. I mean  let's be honest  I call myself a titan. I've got issues. And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed. We run around the yard  up and back and up and back. We have    second dance parties. We sing show tunes. We play with balls. I blow bubbles and they pop them. And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time. I itch for my cell phone always. But it is OK. My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up. I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place. You can do it too  say yes every time your child asks you to play. Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes  You're right  but you can still do this. You have time. You know why  Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet. Your child does not think you're that interesting. You only need    minutes. My two  and four year old only ever want to play with me for about    minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else. It's an amazing    minutes  but it's    minutes. If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy  I'm invisible after    minutes. And my    year old  if I can get a    year old to talk to me for    minutes I'm Parent of the Year.    minutes is all you need. I can totally pull off    minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day. Uninterrupted is the key. No cell phone  no laundry  no anything. You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table. You have to force them to bathe. But you can do    minutes. My kids are my happy place  they're my world  but it doesn't have to be your kids  the fuel that feeds your hum  the place where life feels more good than not good. It's not about playing with your kids  it's about joy. It's about playing in general. Give yourself the    minutes. Find what makes you feel good. Just figure it out and play in that arena. I'm not perfect at it. In fact  I fail as often as I succeed  seeing friends  reading books  staring into space.  Wanna play   starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show  right around the time I became a titan in training  right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.    minutes  What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for    minutes  Turns out  nothing. The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return  as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away. Work doesn't work without play. It takes a little time  but after a few months  one day the floodgates open and there's a rush  and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody  full on groove inside me  and around me  and it sends me spinning with ideas  and the humming road is open  and I can drive it and drive it  and I love working again. But now  I like that hum  but I don't love that hum. I don't need that hum. I am not that hum. That hum is not me  not anymore. I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends. I am that hum. Life's hum. Love's hum. Work's hum is still a piece of me  it is just no longer all of me  and I am so grateful. And I don't give a crap about being a titan  because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover  Red Rover. I said yes to less work and more play  and somehow I still run my world. My brain is still global. My campfires still burn. The more I play  the happier I am  and the happier my kids are. The more I play  the more I feel like a good mother. The more I play  the freer my mind becomes. The more I play  the better I work. The more I play  the more I feel the hum  the nation I'm building  the marathon I'm running  the troops  the canvas  the high note  the hum  the hum  the other hum  the real hum  life's hum. The more I feel that hum  the more this strange  quivering  uncocooned  awkward  brand new  alive non titan feels like me. The more I feel that hum  the more I know who I am. I'm a writer  I make stuff up  I imagine. That part of the job  that's living the dream. That's the dream of the job. Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy. I said yes to less work and more play. Titans need not apply. Wanna play  Thank you.  .  billion years ago  in a distant  distant galaxy  two black holes locked into a spiral  falling inexorably towards each other and collided  converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second. For that brief moment in time  the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe. It was a very big bang. But they didn't release their energy in light. I mean  you know  they're black holes. All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself  making the Universe explode in gravitational waves. Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.  .  billion years ago  Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life. Since then  Earth has made and evolved corals  fish  plants  dinosaurs  people and even    God save us    the Internet. And about    years ago  a particularly audacious set of people    Rai Weiss at MIT  Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech    decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes. Now  most people thought they were nuts. But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea. So after decades of development  construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work  they built their detector  called LIGO  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. For the last several years  LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy  a tremendous improvement in its detection ability. It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result. In early September of       LIGO turned on for a final test run while they sorted out a few lingering details. And on September    of       just days after the detector had gone live  the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth. And they passed through you and me. And they passed through the detector. more emotionally intense than that. One is the birth of my daughter. The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill. You know  it was the payoff of my career  basically. Everything I'd been working on    it's no longer science fiction   Laughs  Allan Adams  So that's my very good friend and collaborator  Scott Hughes  a theoretical physicist at MIT  who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO  for the past    years. So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave. A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time. As the wave passes by  it stretches space and everything in it in one direction  and compresses it in the other. This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.  It stretches and expands  it stretches and expands.  So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak  they're preposterously weak. For example  the waves that hit us on September       and yes  every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave    when the waves hit  they stretched the average person by one part in    to the   . That's a decimal place     zeroes  and a one. That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts. Even with a laser detector five kilometers long    and that's already crazy    they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom. And that's preposterous. So towards the end of his classic text on gravity  LIGO co founder Kip Thorne described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows  He said   The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous. But physicists are ingenious  and with the support of a broad lay public  all obstacles will surely be overcome.  Thorne published that in          years before he succeeded. Now  coming back to LIGO  Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye. I want to explain what that means. Visible light has a wavelength  a size  that's much smaller than the things around you  the features on people's faces  the size of your cell phone. And that's really useful  because it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you  by looking at the light coming from different spots in the scene about you. Sound is different. Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to    feet long. And that makes it really difficult    in fact  in practical purposes  impossible    to make an image of something you really care about. Your child's face. Instead  we use sound to listen for features like pitch and tone and rhythm and volume to infer a story behind the sounds. That's Alice talking. That's Bob interrupting. Silly Bob. So  the same is true of gravitational waves. We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe. But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves  we can hear the story that those waves are telling. And at least for LIGO  the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band. So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air  into sound  we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us. For example  listening to gravity  just in this way  can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes  something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about. you get a very simple chirp  whoop  If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly  I have that same chirp  but with a modulation on top of it  so it kind of goes  whir  whir  whir  It's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform. AA  So on September           a date that's definitely going to live in my memory  LIGO heard this   Whirring sound  So if you know how to listen  that is the sound of    that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender. AA  It's worth pausing here to think about what that means. Two black holes  the densest thing in the Universe  one with a mass of    Suns and one with a mass of    Suns  whirling around each other     times per second before they collide. Just imagine the power of that. It's fantastic. And we know it because we heard it. That's the lasting importance of LIGO. It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before. It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible. And there's a lot out there that we can't see    in practice or even in principle. So supernova  for example  I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae. They're very useful  we've learned a lot about the Universe from them. The problem is  all the interesting physics happens in the core  and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon. We'll never see through it  it's opaque to light. Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass    totally transparent. The Big Bang  I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe  but we'll never see them  because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow. With gravitational waves  we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning. Perhaps most importantly  I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined    things that we'll only discover by listening. And in fact  even in that very first event  LIGO found things that we didn't expect. Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration  Matt Evans  my colleague at MIT  addressing exactly that  that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe. They're these massive things that are old  from prehistoric times  and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology. So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be  and in the end  of course  how we came to be out of this whole mess. AA  Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible. Thanks to LIGO  we know how to build exquisite detectors that can listen to the Universe  to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos. Our job is to dream up and build new observatories    a whole new generation of observatories    on the ground  in space. I mean  what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself  Our job now is to dream big. Dream with us. Thank you. What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion dollar industry. Inspection  environmental monitoring  photography and film and journalism  these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones  and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world. For example  before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness  an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of       bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France  and several years ago  they started to fly with ropes. By tethering flying machines  they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces. They can also autonomously build tensile structures. Skills learned include how to carry loads  how to cope with disturbances  and in general  how to interact with the physical world. Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on. Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight. Now  for a system to function autonomously  it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space. Back at our lab at ETH Zurich  we often use external cameras to locate objects  which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks. For the demos you will see today  however  we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios  a spin off from our lab. There are no external cameras. Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be. The only external commands are high level ones such as  take off  and  land.  This is a so called tail sitter. It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it. Like other fixed wing aircraft  it is efficient in forward flight  much more so than helicopters and variations thereof. Unlike most other fixed wing aircraft  however  it is capable of hovering  which has huge advantages for takeoff  landing and general versatility. There is no free lunch  unfortunately. One of the limitations with tail sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts. We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation. The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in  and through practice  improve its performance over time. OK. When doing research  we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter. For example  one such question would be  what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight  Now  there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question. Helicopters  for example  are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm. It turns out that decades ago  skilled pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts  a propeller and a tail rudder. We recently discovered that it could be done with just one. This is the monospinner  the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine  invented just a few months ago. It has only one moving part  a propeller. It has no flaps  no hinges  no ailerons  no other actuators  no other control surfaces  just a simple propeller. Even though it's mechanically simple  there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space. Even so  it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail sitter  which means that in order to get it to fly  I have to throw it just right. And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low  given everybody watching me  what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night. If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality  this machine here  the omnicopter  with its eight propellers  is an exercise in excess. What can you do with all this surplus  The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric. As a result  it is ambivalent to orientation. This gives it an extraordinary capability. It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating. It has its own complexities  mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers. Some of this can be modeled  while the rest can be learned on the fly. Let's take a look. If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives  they will need to become extremely safe and reliable. This machine over here is actually two separate two propeller flying machines. This one wants to spin clockwise. This other one wants to spin counterclockwise. When you put them together  they behave like one high performance quadrocopter. If anything goes wrong  however    a motor fails  a propeller fails  electronics  even a battery pack    the machine can still fly  albeit in a degraded fashion. We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves. This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms. The large number of autonomous  coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression. We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters  each weighing less than a slice of bread  by the way  and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms. Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self controlled  there is really no limit to their number. Hopefully  these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines. That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway. The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology. And for folks like us  the real reward is the journey and the act of creation. It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is  that it allows creative  clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways. The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake. Thank you. I was excited to be a part of the  Dream  theme  and then I found out I'm leading off the  Nightmare   section of it. And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify. And I have some bad news  but I have a lot more good news. I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news. But    hang on  because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive. So the first question is   Do we really have to change   And of course  the Apollo Mission  among other things changed the environmental movement  really launched the modern environmental movement.    months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth  the first Earth Day was organized. And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space. And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us. One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky. As this picture illustrates  the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground. It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet. That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized. We are spewing     million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution into it every    hours  free of charge  go ahead. And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases  I'm certainly not going to go through them all. I'm going to focus on the main one  but agriculture is involved  diet is involved  population is involved. Management of forests  transportation  the oceans  the melting of the permafrost. But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem  which is the fact that we still rely on dirty  carbon based fuels for    percent of all the energy that our world burns every year. And you can see from this image that after World War II  the emission rates started really accelerating. And the accumulated amount of man made  global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by         Hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every    hours      days a year. Fact checked over and over again  conservative  it's the truth. Now it's a big planet  but    that is a lot of energy  particularly when you multiply it         times per day. And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere  the whole earth system. Let's look at the atmosphere. This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures. The white represents normal temperature days            are arbitrarily chosen. The blue are cooler than average days  the red are warmer than average days. But the entire curve has moved to the right in the     s. And you'll see in the lower right hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days. In the   s  the curve shifted further. And in the last    years  you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days. In fact  they are     times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just    years ago. So we're having record breaking temperatures. Fourteen of the    of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century. The hottest of all was last year. Last month was the    st month in a row warmer than the   th century average. And for the first time  not only the warmest January  but for the first time  it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average. These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals  plants  people  ecosystems. But on a global basis     percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans. And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths  deep  mid ocean  the first few hundred meters. And this  too  is accelerating. It goes back more than a century. And more than half of the increase has been in the last    years. This has consequences. The first order of consequence  the ocean based storms get stronger. Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban  as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall. Pope Francis  who has made such a difference to this whole issue  visited Tacloban right after that. Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey. The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now. The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies. Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent. And it creates these atmospheric rivers. The Brazilian scientists call them  flying rivers.  And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record breaking downpours. This is from Montana. Take a look at this storm last August. As it moves over Tucson  Arizona. It literally splashes off the city. These downpours are really unusual. Last July in Houston  Texas  it rained for two days      billion gallons. That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city  which was  of course  paralyzed. These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides. This one is from Chile last year. And you'll see that warehouse going by. There are oil tankers cars going by. This is from Spain last September  you could call this the running of the cars and trucks  I guess. Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. I mean  really. The insurance industry has certainly noticed  the losses have been mounting up. They're not under any illusions about what's happening. And the causality requires a moment of discussion. We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect    one cause  one effect. This is systemic causation. As the great Kevin Trenberth says   All storms are different now. There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere  there's so much extra water vapor. Every storm is different now.  So  the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper  longer  more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now. It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America. There's certainly been evidence of that  a lot of them. More lightning  as the heat energy builds up  there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also. These climate related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability. The climate related historic drought that started in Syria in      destroyed    percent of the farms in Syria  killed    percent of the livestock  and drove  .  million climate refugees into the cities of Syria  where they collided with another  .  million refugees from the Iraq War. And along with other factors  that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now. The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis  including refugees  food and water shortages and pandemic disease. Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes  the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this. But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors  like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them. The Zika epidemic now    we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system. But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years    that's something new  that ought to get our attention. The Lancet  one of the two greatest medical journals in the world  last summer labeled this a medical emergency now. And there are many factors because of it. This is also connected to the extinction crisis. We're in danger of losing    percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century. And already  land based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of    feet per day. Speaking of the North Pole  last December     the same storm that caused historic flooding in the American Midwest  raised temperatures at the North Pole    degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal  causing the thawing of the North Pole in the middle of the long  dark  winter  polar night. And when the land based ice of the Arctic melts  it raises sea level. Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this. It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly  Antarctica. The    largest risk cities for sea level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia. When you measure it by assets at risk  number one is Miami  three and a half trillion dollars at risk. Number three  New York and Newark. I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon  one of the highest high tide days. And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey. And this happens regularly during the highest tide tides now. Not with rain    they call it  sunny day flooding.  It comes up through the storm sewers. And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens. This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day. We have to move beyond partisanship. And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans    who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk  by telling the truth about the climate crisis. So the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up  there are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned. It's an enormous burden. I'll mention just one more  because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos  after their annual survey of     economists  said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy. So you get central bankers like Mark Carney  the head of the UK Central Bank  saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable. Subprime carbon. I'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages  but it's the same thing. If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution  this is the quantity burned in the last    years. Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books     trillion dollars. The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned. So the rest     trillion dollars    unburnable. Risk to the global economy. That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative. So the answer to the first question   Must we change   is yes  we have to change. Second question   Can we change   This is the exciting news  The best projections in the world    years ago were that by       the world would be able to install    gigawatts of wind capacity. We beat that mark by    and a half times over. We see an exponential curve for wind installations now. We see the cost coming down dramatically. Some countries    take Germany  an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's  by the way    one day last December  got    percent of all its energy from renewable resources  mainly solar and wind. A lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis. More good news  energy storage  from batteries particularly  is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem. With solar  the news is even more exciting  The best projections    years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by     . When      came around  we beat that mark by    times over. Last year  we beat it by    times over. This year  we're on track to beat it    times over. We're going to win this. We are going to prevail. The exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic. When I came to this stage    years ago  this is where it was. We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves. And the cost has come down    percent per year for    years. And it's continuing to come down. Now  the business community has certainly noticed this  because it's crossing the grid parity point. Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise. Grid parity is understood as that line  that threshold  below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels. That threshold is a little bit like the difference between    degrees Fahrenheit and    degrees Fahrenheit  or zero and one Celsius. It's a difference of more than one degree  it's the difference between ice and water. And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up  and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment. This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world  and two thirds of it is in the private sector. We are seeing an explosion of new investment. Starting in       investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils. The gap has been growing ever since. The projections for the future are even more dramatic  even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate    times larger than renewables. And by the way  if you add the projections for nuclear on here  particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable  more affordable forms of nuclear  this could change even more dramatically. So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology  Well  there are many  but let's look at cell phones. In       AT T  then Ma Bell  commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.  How many can we sell by the year        they asked. McKinsey came back and said          .  And sure enough  when the year      arrived  they did sell            in the first three days. And for the balance of the year  they sold     times more. And now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world. So  why were they not only wrong  but way wrong  I've asked that question myself   Why   And I think the answer is in three parts. First  the cost came down much faster than anybody expected  even as the quality went up. And low income countries  places that did not have a landline grid    they leap frogged to the new technology. The big expansion has been in the developing counties. So what about the electricity grids in the developing world  Well  not so hot. And in many areas  they don't exist. There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America. So now we're getting this  solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable. Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro credit. This is a village market. Bangladesh is now the fastest deploying country in the world  two systems per minute on average  night and day. And we have all we need  enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year. It's actually a little bit less than an hour. So the answer to the second question   Can we change   is clearly  Yes.  And it's an ever firmer  yes.  Last question   Will we change   Paris really was a breakthrough  some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot. But nations aren't waiting  they're going ahead. China has already announced that starting next year  they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system. They will likely link up with the European Union. The United States has already been changing. All of these coal plants were proposed in the next    years and canceled. All of these existing coal plants were retired. All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced. All of them    canceled. We are moving forward. Last year    if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States  almost three quarters was from renewable energy  mostly wind and solar. We are solving this crisis. The only question is  how long will it take to get there  So  it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change. Almost         people marched in New York City before the UN special session on this. Many thousands  tens of thousands  marched in cities around the world. And so  I am extremely optimistic. As I said before  we are going to win this. I'll finish with this story. When I was    years old  I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in    years. And I heard adults of that day and time say   That's reckless  expensive  may well fail.  But eight years and two months later  in the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon  there was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston. Here's a little known fact about that  the average age of the systems engineers  the controllers in the room that day  was     which means  among other things  their age  when they heard that challenge  was   . We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced. One of the greatest poets of the last century in the US  Wallace Stevens  wrote a line that has stayed with me   After the final 'no ' there comes a 'yes ' and on that 'yes'  the future world depends.  When the abolitionists started their movement  they met with no after no after no. And then came a yes. The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's  until finally  there was a yes. The Civil Rights Movement  the movement against apartheid  and more recently  the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere. After the final  no  comes a  yes.  When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong  the outcome is fore ordained because of who we are as human beings. Ninety nine percent of us  that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this. We have everything we need. Some still doubt that we have the will to act  but I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  You've got this incredible combination of skills. You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues  and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language. No one else can do that  that's why you led this thing. It was amazing to see it    years ago  it was amazing to see it now. Al Gore  Well  you're nice to say that  Chris. But honestly  I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it. And that's the key to trying to communicate. CA  So  your talk. First part  terrifying  second part  incredibly hopeful. How do we know that all those graphs  all that progress  is enough to solve what you showed in the first part  AG  I think that the crossing    you know  I've only been in the business world for    years. But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent  or cheaper than. Turns out  it makes a difference if it's cheaper than. And when it crosses that line  then a lot of things really change. We are regularly surprised by these developments. The late Rudi Dornbusch  the great economist said   Things take longer to happen then you think they will  and then they happen much faster than you thought they could.  I really think that's where we are. Some people are using the phrase  The Solar Singularity  now  meaning when it gets below the grid parity  unsubsidized in most places  then it's the default choice. Now  in one of the presentations yesterday  the jitney thing  there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down. And I just don't think it's going to work. There's a woman in Atlanta  Debbie Dooley  who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party. They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations. And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request. And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party. And they defeated the proposal. So  finally  the answer to your question is  this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a clich   but    years ago    and Christiana referred to this    there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves. And it didn't work out economically for some of them  but it kick started this global revolution. And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this. But it matters a lot how fast we win it. CA  Al Gore  that was incredibly powerful. If this turns out to be the year  that the partisan thing changes  as you said  it's no longer a partisan issue  but you bring along people from the other side together  backed by science  backed by these kinds of investment opportunities  backed by reason that you win the day    boy  that's really exciting. Thank you so much. AG  Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED. Thank you  What do you think when you look at me  A woman of faith  An expert  Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed  brainwashed  a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative  I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that    percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers. Well  for those of you who have never met a Muslim  it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom  a coffee lover    double espresso  cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing  spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says  because baby  I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was     I decided to come out. No  not as a gay person like some of my friends  but as a Muslim  and decided to start wearing the hijab  my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast   Why are you oppressing yourself   The funny thing was  it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a    year old  to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected and questioned and doubted and  ultimately  believed. My relationship with God    it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you  completely understands you and yet loves you anyway  That's how it feels. And so later  I got married  and like all good Egyptians  started my career as an engineer. I later had a child  after getting married  and I was living essentially the Egyptian American dream. And then that terrible morning of September      . I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast  and I look up on the screen and see the words  Breaking News.  There was smoke  airplanes flying into buildings  people jumping out of buildings. What was this  An accident  A malfunction  My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this  And I switch the channel and I hear   ... Muslim terrorist ...    ... in the name of Islam ...    ... Middle Eastern descent ...    ... jihad ...    ... we should bomb Mecca.  Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked  but in a flash  somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day  we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school. And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence  crouched as low as I could go in my seat  for the first time in my life  afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world. And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like   Be alert    Be aware    Stay in well lit areas    Don't congregate.  I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week  the day that Muslims congregate for worship. And again the warnings were   Don't go that first Friday  it could be a target.  And I was watching the news  wall to wall coverage. Emotions were so raw  understandably  and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims  or people who were perceived to be Muslim  being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought  we should just stay home. And yet  something didn't feel right. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry at the terrorists. Guess what  So was I. And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually saying things like   There's a problem in this country  and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them   So  some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques. They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is  are we malignant or benign  You know  a malignant tumor you extract altogether  and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense  because it's the wrong question. Muslims  like all other Americans  aren't a tumor in the body of America  we're a vital organ. Thank you. Muslims are inventors and teachers  first responders and Olympic athletes. Now  is closing down mosques going to make America safer  It might free up some parking spots  but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief in the Washington  DC area recently told me  people don't actually get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom  in front of a computer. And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online  but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community  from even their family  so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they  the terrorists  are the true Muslims  and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization  we have to keep people going to the mosque. Now  some will still argue Islam is a violent religion. After all  a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran. Now  as a Muslim  as a mother  as a human being  I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of  .  billion people. Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity. Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them  they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture. Recently  a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him  had she been in contact with a radical religious leader  And he said the problem was quite the opposite  that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage  her sense of injustice in the world  was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger  she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage    instead  he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans  How does it impact everyone else  How does consuming fear    hours a day affect the health of our democracy  the health of our free thought  Well  one study    actually  several studies in neuroscience    show that when we're afraid  at least three things happen. We become more accepting of authoritarianism  conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims  they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims. Now  this isn't just academic. When you look at when anti Muslim sentiment spiked between      and       it happened three times  but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool of public manipulation  eroding the very foundation of a free society  which is rational and well informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it  but the toxic air of fear is harming us all. And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill  North Carolina  where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school  talented  promising ... And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest  most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume  and she was amazed. She said   When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man   Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife  their neighbor  Craig Stephen Hicks  murdered them  as well as Yusor's sister  Razan  who was visiting for the afternoon  in their apartment  execution style  after posting anti Muslim statements on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral  it can even be lethal. So  back to my story. What happened after       Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home  Well  we talked it over  and it might seem like a small decision  but to us  it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids  one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat  buckled him in  and we drove silently  intensely  to the mosque. I took him out  I took off my shoes  I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement  thanking and welcoming our guests  because half the congregation were Christians  Jews  Buddhists  atheists  people of faith and no faith  who had come not to attack us  but to stand in solidarity with us. I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose  What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry  Will you play it safe  Or will you join those who say we are better than that  Thank you. Thank you so much. Helen Walters  So Dalia  you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder  what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk  you're clearly a deep thinker  you work at a fancy think tank  you're an exception  you're not the rule. What would you say to those people  Dalia Mogahed  I would say  don't let this stage distract you  I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims around the world    and I've done this  I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world    people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family  they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule  oftentimes it's that the rule is broken  not that they're an exception to it. HW  Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed. I believe big institutions have unique potential to create change  and I believe that we as individuals have unique power to influence the direction that those institutions take. Now  these beliefs did not come naturally to me  because trusting big institutions  not really part of my family legacy. My mother escaped North Korea when she was    years old. To do so  she had to elude every big institution in her life  repressive governments  occupying armies and even armed border patrols. Later  when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States  she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest. Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States. Because of her bravery and passion  I've had all the opportunities that she never did  and that has made my story so different. Instead of running away from big institutions  I've actually run toward them. I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal  the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world  where I lead sustainable investing. Now  these institutions are like tankers  and working inside of them  I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave  and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets  the nearly     trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world  that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal  if we ask it to be. Now  I know some of you are thinking  global capital markets  positive social change  not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph. I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean. It's a vast  impersonal  uncaring force of nature that is not affected by our wishes or desires. So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones  but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides  don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves. But why is that  Because actually  one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us  and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us  as members  participants  beneficiaries  shareholders or citizens. So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets  why aren't we able to make our voices heard  Why can't we make some waves  So let me ask you a different question  did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks  OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso glazed Chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have  Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars  So why do we do these things  Right  One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of  .  billion combustion engine vehicles. One fish is just one fish in the sea. And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But we do these things because we believe they matter  that our actions add up  that our choices might influence others and collectively  what an impact we can have. So  in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago. It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it. Look at some of the things that are on it  that it says.  This one cup can be used again and again.   This one cup may inspire others to use one too.   This one cup helps save the planet.  I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful. So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters  but what we do with       dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't  Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care  that we care about fair labor standards  that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities  Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars  but we would vote with our lattes  So I think it has something to do with the myths  the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness. Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot  If you said to the pot   Boil  little pot  boil   it would fill up with sweet porridge. And if you said   Stop  little pot  stop   it would stop. But if you got the words wrong  it wouldn't listen  and things could go terribly awry. So I think when it comes to markets  we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads. We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command  make more money. Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold. Add in some extra words like  protect the environment   the spell might not work. Put in the wrong words like  promote social justice   and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely  according to this fable. So we asked people  what do you really think  And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors  and we found something fascinating. Overwhelmingly  people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.    percent of people said yes  they were interested in sustainable investing  which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance.    percent wanted that.    percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially. So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good. But here was the weird thing     percent of the people still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks  they thought that they would make less money. So is it true  Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade grown coffee instead of drinking it  Well  you know  the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben   Jerry's wouldn't say so. Right  Both of those started out as small  socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each. But here's the important thing. Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments  they had to preserve that socially conscious mission. If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious  those brands wouldn't make more money. But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule  right  The serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round  they need to stick to making more money. So  Harvard Business School actually researched this  and they found something fascinating. If you had invested a dollar    years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter  that one dollar would have grown to    dollars and    cents. That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues  that one dollar would have grown to    dollars and    cents. almost twice as much sweet porridge. Now  let's be clear  they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen. They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business  like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes  like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long term results of the company and the communities they served  not just quarterly results  or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty  retention and productivity. Now  Harvard's not alone. Oxford also did a research study where they examined     different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results  and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency  lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price. And then there's Al Gore. So    years ago  when I worked for Al Gore in the White House  he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change. Post White House  he opened an investment firm called Generation  where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process. And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views. Ten years later  his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing. Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix  he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark. Now  sustainable investing  the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell and it doesn't require some investment secret  and it's not just for the elite. It is not just about private equity for billionaires. It's not just groovy sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn. It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune     companies. It's about mutual funds. It's about all the things we already see in the market today. So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal. First  the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right  preserving all the same good principles of investing  the traditional sphere  can pay. It makes sense. Secondly  the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads. We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking  that you get less sweet porridge. And once you get rid of the fable  you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about. And third  the future is already here. Sustainable investment today is a    trillion dollar market and it's the fastest growing segment of the investment industry. In the United States  it has grown enormously  as you can see. It now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the United States. So what are we waiting for  For me  it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother. She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story. She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army  no obstacle  no big institution stand in her way. She made it to the States  and she became a teacher  an award winning author and a mother  and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard. And these days  you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world. It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means  passionate clarity.  Passionate clarity  that's what I think we need to drive change. Passion about the change we want to see in the world  and clarity that we are able to help chart the course. We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices. We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard. So change your perspective. Vote with your small change. Invest in the change you want to see in the world. Change the fables and change the markets. Thank you. When I moved to Harare in       social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy. The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda  health care services  primary education became essentially free. A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly    percent of the population less than a two hour walk from these facilities  a truly remarkable accomplishment. In       the year of independence     percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized. By       a mere decade later  this proportion stood at    percent. I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation  a revolution. The excitement  the camaraderie  was palpable. Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans    scientists  doctors  activists    I felt connected not only to an African independence movement  but to a global progressive public health movement. But there were daunting challenges. Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in       the year I arrived. I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early     s  when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital  but    we had no idea what lay in store for Africa. Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there. These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare    years later. By the mid     s  I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV positive. I saw colleagues and friends die  my students  hospital patients  die. In response  my colleagues and I set up a clinic. We did condom demonstrations. We launched school education and workplace interventions. We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves. We worked hard  and at the time  I believed that I was doing my best. I was providing excellent treatment  such as it was. But I was not talking about structural change. Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide. In       he was head of the UN peacekeeping department. At a    year memorial for the genocide  he reflected   I believed at the time I was doing my best  but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support.  The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared  and today  when the World Health Organization estimates that    million people have lost their lives to this disease  I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier. But while living in Zimbabwe  I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one. I was there for my technical skills  both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills. And in my mind  my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission  and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus. I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS. And on the sugar plantations  which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms than any modern enterprise     percent of pregnant women tested HIV positive. I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority  to forced migrant labor and to colonialism. Whites were largely unscathed. As health professionals  our tools were pitifully weak  imploring people to change their individual behaviors  use condoms  reduce number of partners. Infection rates climbed  and when treatment became available in the West  treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus  it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa. I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population. I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country  that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out  keep me from doing good work  taking care of my patients  doing much needed research. So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS. I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough. Many doctors  health professionals  may think I did nothing wrong. Our pact with our patients  the Hippocratic Oath and its variants  is about the sanctity of the patient doctor relationship. And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine. But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society  reflecting not only biology  but more importantly patterns of marginalization  exclusion  discrimination related to race  gender  sexuality  class and more. It was true of AIDS. It was true just recently of Ebola. Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer  who worked on AIDS in Haiti  call this structural violence  structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world  often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power  and violence because its impact    premature deaths  suffering  illness    is violent. We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices. Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right  and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together. So these days  I'm not staying quiet. I'm speaking up about a lot of things  even when it makes listeners uncomfortable  even when it makes me uncomfortable. And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism  things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore  certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health. But we have them  and we pay for them in lives cut short. That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States  the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face  compounded by our tragic legacy of     years of slavery     years of Jim Crow and    years of imperfect equality  sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner. In New York City  premature mortality    that's death before the age of       is    percent higher for black men than white ones. A black woman in      faced more than    times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman. And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates  a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby. New York City's not exceptional. These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States. A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are  .  million missing black men across the country. They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of    and    years have disappeared from daily life  lost either to prison or premature death. There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men  the focus of recent protests under the banner  BlackLivesMatter. But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions    heart disease  cancer  diabetes  HIV    diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely. As the  BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded  I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word  racism  in our research and our work. You've probably felt something every time I've said it. Our medical students held die ins in their white coats  but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality. And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine  looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment  may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture  that it is the daily context  where a person lives  grows  works  loves  that most importantly determines population health  and for too many of us  poor health. As health professionals in our daily work  whether in the clinic or doing research  we are witness to great injustice  the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities  the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh  the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child. Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change. Rightfully or not  our societal position gives our voices great credibility  and we shouldn't waste that. I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe  and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner  I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity. I will speak out against racism  and I hope you will join me  and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality. It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality. We don't have to have all the answers to call for change. We just need courage. The health of our patients  the health of us all  depends on it. There are a few things that all of us need. We all need air to breathe. We need clean water to drink. We need food to eat. We need shelter and love. You know. Love is great  too. And we all need a safe place to pee. As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary  if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate  the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall  gender neutral bathrooms in all public places. Trans people and trans issues  they've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately. And this is a great and necessary thing  but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals  most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous  and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college  or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school. Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis. Public bathrooms. They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember  first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine appearing  predominantly estrogen based organism. Now  today as a trans person  public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed. I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors. I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up. I've been stared at  screamed at  whispered about  and one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner I took home that day I am pretty certain contained at least    dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection. And I know what some of you are thinking  and you're mostly right. I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days. But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas  does it  And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man. I'm a trans person. And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills. Have you heard about these  They try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate according to the gender I was assigned at birth. And if these politicians ever get their way  in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston  Texas  or Ottawa  well then  using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either. And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table  I can't help but wonder  you know  just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right  Panty checks  Really. Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools  There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway. They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia. They don't make anyone safer. But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us. And meanwhile  our trans children suffer. They drop out of school  or they opt out of life altogether. Trans people  especially trans and gender nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms  but also universities  hospitals  libraries. Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports. If we don't move now to make sure that these places are truly open and accessible to everyone  then we just need to get honest and quit calling them public places. We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes  which I do not. I never have. And this starts very early. I know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine. She's a self identified tomboy. I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars  the whole nine yards. One time I asked her what her favorite color was. She told me   Camouflage.  So that awesome little kid  she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom. And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom. And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party  and I mean  who can resist that red juice  right  It's so good. And she couldn't hold her pee any longer. Her and her classmates were four years old. They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so called public bathrooms. She was four years old. She had already been taught the brutal lesson that there was no bathroom door at preschool with a sign on it that welcomed people like her. She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem  and that problem started with her and was hers alone. So my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter  and I did. I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school  and the problem was going to go away  but I knew that wasn't true. I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older  but I couldn't. So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened  asked her to tell me how it made her feel.  Mad and sad   she told me. So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her  and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before. I said yes  I had  but not for a really long time. Which of course was a lie  because you know how you hit  like     or     and sometimes you just  I don't know  you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze  when you're running upstairs  or you're stretching. Don't lie. It happens. Right  She doesn't need to know that  I figure. I told her  when you get older  your bladder is going to grow bigger  too. When you get old like me  you're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer  I promised her.  Until you can get home   she asked me. I said   Yes  until you can get home.  She seemed to take some comfort in that. So let's just build some single stall  gender neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes. We can't change the world overnight for our children  but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world  if only for just a minute. This we can do. So let's just do it. And if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now already coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority  or it's too expensive  or telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee or get changed in supports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality  or your masculinity  or your religious beliefs  then let me just appeal to the part of your heart that probably  hopefully  does care about the rest of the population. If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me  then what about women and girls with body image issues  What about anyone with body image stuff going on  What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates  whose voice still hasn't dropped yet  Hey  Oh  grade eight  what a cruel master you can be. Right  What about people with anxiety issues  What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there  What about folks with bodies who  for whatever reason  don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like  How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers  and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise  Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities  We can't change transphobic minds overnight  but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us. Thank you for listening. Thank you. As a kid  I used to dream about the ocean. It was this wild place full of color and life  home to these alien looking  fantastical creatures. I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs. As a marine biologist turned photographer  I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little. As you can see  I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age. But the first time I truly went underwater  I was about    years old. And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old  encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef. And when I finally managed to grab hold of it  I looked up  and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow. That was the day I fell in love with the ocean. Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my    years on this planet  I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation. I've photographed everything from really  really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand. I've smelled the fishy  fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest. And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel. Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean. And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find. They are becoming more compressed and more threatened. As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth  I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand. For a long time  I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images. And while this approach has merits  I have come full circle. I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love. I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer  I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface. You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists. Uncovering this    that is the power of conservation photography. I've visited hundreds of marine locations  but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply. The first time I experienced that kind of high was about    years ago  off South Africa's rugged  wild coast. And every June and July  enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run. And boy  do those fish have good reason to run. In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators. Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls. They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast. Close behind are sharks. Now  most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies  but during the Sardine Run  they actually coexist. In fact  dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively. Without dolphins  the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut  or a mouth full of water. Now  while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run  I know they don't see me as prey. However  I get bumped and tail slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy  rowdy banquet. From the shores of Africa we travel east  across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives  an archipelago of coral islands. And during the stormy southwest monsoon  manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru. Armies of crustaceans  most no bigger than the size of your pupils  are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet. When plankton concentrations become patchy  manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again  very much like a puppy chasing its own tail. However  when plankton densities increase  the mantas line up head to tail to form these long feeding chains  and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after. As plankton levels peak in the bay  the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding. And as they swirl in tight formation  this multi step column of mantas creates its own vortex  sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths. The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable. When I first photographed Hanifaru  the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development. And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust  my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine protected area. Now  fisherman from neighboring islands  they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins. Today  they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of   million dollars every single year. I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read   There be dragons.  And today  the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean. Far  far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets  diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like. Very few people have heard of Bassas da India  a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel. Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks. These sharks are anything but shy  even during the day. I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night. Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop. Capturing and sharing moments like this    that reminds me why I chose my path. Earlier this year  I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California. And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon  a critical calving ground for gray whales. For     years  this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter  where more than        gray whales were killed  leaving only a few hundred survivors. Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us. This species truly has made a remarkable comeback. Now  on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo  a sleepy fishing village. Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse. In       local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve. But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous. In       after only a single decade of protection  scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded. But don't take my word for it    come with me. On a single breath  swim with me in deep  into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered. We all have the ability to be creators of hope. And through my photography  I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans. And particularly  I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of  .  billion people. My hope is that in the future  I will have to search much  much harder to make photographs like this  while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean. Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me. To thrive and survive in my profession  you really have to be a hopeless optimist. And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner  behind the next coral head  inside the next lagoon or possibly  in the one after it.
