So  I didn't always make my living from music. For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university  this was my day job. I was a self employed living statue called the Eight Foot Bride  and I love telling people I did this for a job  because everybody always wants to know  who are these freaks in real life. Hello. I painted myself white one day  stood on a box  put a hat or a can at my feet  and when someone came by and dropped in money  I handed them a flower    and some intense eye contact. And if they didn't take the flower  I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing    as they walked away. So I had the most profound encounters with people  especially lonely people who looked like they hadn't talked to anyone in weeks  and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street  and we would sort of fall in love a little bit. And my eyes would say     Thank you. I see you.  And their eyes would say     Nobody ever sees me. Thank you.  I would get harassed sometimes. People would yell at me from their cars.  Get a job    This is my job.  But it hurt  because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un joblike and unfair  shameful. I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box. And for the economists out there  you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income  which was shocking to me  given I had no regular customers  but pretty much    bucks on a Tuesday     bucks on a Friday. It was consistent. And meanwhile  I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band  the Dresden Dolls. This was me on piano  a genius drummer. I wrote the songs  and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue  and as we started touring  I really didn't want to lose this sense of direct connection with people  because I loved it. So after all of our shows  we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people  and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us  and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows  and they would pass the hat  and then they would come in and join us onstage  so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird  random circus guests. And then Twitter came along  and made things even more magic  because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere. So I would need a piano to practice on  and an hour later I would be at a fan's house. This is in London. People would bring home cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us. This is in Seattle. Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last minute  spontaneous  free gig. This is a library in Auckland. On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat  because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast  and they showed up care of this dude  Chris  from Newport Beach  who says hello. I once tweeted   Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot   And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in  and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death. And I love this kind of random closeness  which is lucky  because I do a lot of couchsurfing. In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless  and in punk squats  everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless  clearly making it the better option. My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an    year old girl  still living at home  and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras. And that night  her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds. And I lay there thinking  these people have so little. Is this fair  And in the morning  her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible  and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English   Your music has helped my daughter so much. Thank you for staying here. We're all so grateful.  And I thought  this is fair. This is this. A couple of months later  I was in Manhattan  and I tweeted for a crash pad  and at midnight  I'm on the Lower East Side  and it occurs to me I've never actually done this alone. I've always been with my band or my crew. Is this what stupid people do  Is this how stupid people die  And before I can change my mind  the door busts open. She's an artist. He's a financial blogger for Reuters  and they're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath  and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that. So I couchsurf a lot. I also crowdsurf a lot. I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing. You're falling into the audience and you're trusting each other. I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money  something that I did a lot. And as usual  the band was psyched  but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn't bring himself to go out there. It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat. And I recognized his fear of  Is this fair   and  Get a job.  And meanwhile  my band is becoming bigger and bigger. We sign with a major label. And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret. It's not for everybody. Well  maybe it's for you. We sign  and there's all this hype leading up to our next record. And it comes out and it sells about        copies in the first few weeks  and the label considers this a failure. I was like           isn't that a lot   They said   No  the sales are going down. It's a failure.  And they walk off. Right at this same time  I'm signing and hugging after a gig  and a guy comes up to me and hands me a     bill  and he says   I'm sorry  I burned your CD from a friend.   But I read your blog  I know you hate your label. I just want you to have this money.  And this starts happening all the time. I become the hat after my own gigs  but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people  and unlike the guy in the opening band  I've actually had a lot of practice standing there. Thank you. And this is the moment I decide I'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible  so it's like Metallica over here  Napster  bad  Amanda Palmer over here  and I'm going to encourage torrenting  downloading  sharing  but I'm going to ask for help  because I saw it work on the street. So I fought my way off my label  and for my next project with my new band  the Grand Theft Orchestra  I turned to crowdfunding. And I fell into those thousands of connections that I'd made  and I asked my crowd to catch me. And the goal was         dollars. My fans backed me at nearly  .  million  which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date. And you can see how many people it is. It's about        people. And the media asked   Amanda  the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music   And the real answer is  I didn't make them. I asked them. And through the very act of asking people  I'd connected with them  and when you connect with them  people want to help you. It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable. And I got a lot of criticism online  after my Kickstarter went big  for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices  specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer  and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website. And this hurt in a really familiar way. And people saying   You're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help   really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling   Get a job.  Because they weren't with us on the sidewalk  and they couldn't see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd  an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them. So this is slightly not safe for work. This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin. At the end of the night  I stripped and let everyone draw on me. Now let me tell you  if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers    I recommend this  especially if those strangers are drunk German people. This was a ninja master level fan connection  because what I was really saying here was  I trust you this much. Should I  Show me. For most of human history  musicians  artists  they've been part of the community. Connectors and openers  not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance  but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough. So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price. They see it as an unpredictable risk  but the things I've done  the Kickstarter  the street  the doorbell  I don't see these things as risk. I see them as trust. Now  the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street  they're getting there. But the perfect tools aren't going to help us if we can't face each other and give and receive fearlessly  but  more important    to ask without shame. My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box. So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers  our mistakes  and we see each other. And I think when we really see each other  we want to help each other. I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question  which is   How do we make people pay for music   What if we started asking   How do we let people pay for music   Thank you. The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us. This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality  increasingly grim reality  and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology  and that's very understandable. Now  this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population  rising towards    billion people  land that is turning to desert  and  of course  climate change. Now there's no question about it at all  we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology. But fossil fuels  carbon    coal and gas    are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change. Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert  and this happens only when we create too much bare ground. There's no other cause. And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert. But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine. We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. On those  it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground. No matter what you do  nature covers it up so quickly. And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness  and that is where desertification is occurring. Fortunately  with space technology now  we can look at it from space  and when we do  you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally  what you see in green is not desertifying  and what you see in brown is  and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth. About two thirds  I would guess  of the world is desertifying. I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while    millimeters    that's an inch of rain    was falling. Think of it in terms of drums of water  each containing     liters. Over       drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day. The next day  the land looked like this. Where had that water gone  Some of it ran off as flooding  but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again  exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. Now  because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter  when we damage soils  you give off carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you're told over and over  repeatedly  that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi arid areas of the world  and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence. But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them  you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae  leading to increased runoff and evaporation. That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock  mostly cattle  sheep and goats  overgrazing the plants  leaving the soil bare and giving off methane. Almost everybody knows this  from nobel laureates to golf caddies  or was taught it  as I was. Now  the environments like you see here  dusty environments in Africa where I grew up  and I loved wildlife  and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing. And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs. Well  I have news for you. We were once just as certain that the world was flat. We were wrong then  and we are wrong again. And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery. When I was a young man  a young biologist in Africa  I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner   this was in the     s   and no sooner did we remove the hunting  drum beating people to protect the animals  than the land began to deteriorate  as you see in this park that we formed. Now  no livestock were involved  but suspecting that we had too many elephants now  I did the research and I proved we had too many  and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain. Now  that was a terrible decision for me to have to make  and it was political dynamite  frankly. So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research. They did. They agreed with me  and over the following years  we shot        elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse  not better. Loving elephants as I do  that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life  and I will carry that to my grave. One good thing did come out of it. It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions. When I came to the United States  I got a shock  to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa. And there'd been no livestock on this land for over    years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural. So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification  but I found the opposite  as we see on this research station  where this grassland that was green in       by      had changed to that situation. And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to  unknown processes.  Clearly  we have never understood what is causing desertification  which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here  and I promise you  you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter  plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now  by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land  you are changing macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen        years ago  Why has it accelerated lately  We had no understanding of that. What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world  the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals  and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack hunting predators. Now  the main defense against pack hunting predators is to get into herds  and the larger the herd  the safer the individuals. Now  large herds dung and urinate all over their own food  and they have to keep moving  and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants  while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil  as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassland. It has just come through four months of rain  and it's now going into eight months of dry season. And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season. Now  all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season  and if it doesn't  the grassland and the soil begin to die. Now  if it does not decay biologically  it shifts to oxidation  which is a very slow process  and this smothers and kills grasses  leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil  releasing carbon. To prevent that  we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare  releasing carbon  and worse than that  burning one hectare of grassland gives off more  and more damaging  pollutants than       cars. And we are burning in Africa  every single year  more than one billion hectares of grasslands  and almost nobody is talking about it. We justify the burning  as scientists  because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow. Now  looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry  what could we do to keep that healthy  And bear in mind  I'm talking of most of the world's land now. Okay  We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change. We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change. What are we going to do  There is only one option  I'll repeat to you  only one option left to climatologists and scientists  and that is to do the unthinkable  and to use livestock  bunched and moving  as a proxy for former herds and predators  and mimic nature. There is no other alternative left to mankind. So let's do that. So on this bit of grassland  we'll do it  but just in the foreground. We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature  and we've done so  and look at that. All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung  urine and litter or mulch  as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand  and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain  to store carbon  and to break down methane. And we did that  without using fire to damage the soil  and the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification  I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it  We'd had        years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals  but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world. Then we'd had     years of modern rain science  and that had accelerated desertification  as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States  and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals  and humans  over thousands of years  had never been able to deal with nature's complexity. But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this. So rather than reinvent the wheel  I began studying other professions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need  and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing  a planning process  and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social  environmental  economic complexity. Today  we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds  plan their grazing to mimic nature  and where we have them hold their animals overnight    we run them in a predator friendly manner  because we have a lot of lands  and so on    and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields  we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well. Let's look at some results. This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe. It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year  and it's going into the long dry season. But as you can see  all of that rain  almost of all it  has evaporated from the soil surface. Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended  and we have         people on almost permanent food aid. Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day  with the same rainfall  and look at that. Our river is flowing and healthy and clean. It's fine. The production of grass  shrubs  trees  wildlife  everything is now more productive  and we have virtually no fear of dry years. And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats     percent  planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants  buffalo  giraffe and other animals that we have. But before we began  our land looked like that. This site was bare and eroding for over    years regardless of what rain we got. Okay  Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. This was another site where it had been bare and eroding  and at the base of the marked small tree  we had lost over    centimeters of soil. Okay  And again  watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature. And there are fallen trees in there now  because the better land is now attracting elephants  etc. This land in Mexico was in terrible condition  and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound. I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the     s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland  and thankfully  now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future. And look at the amazing change in this one  where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature  and once more  we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying. The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here. The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher  and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers. They put        sheep in one flock  really mimicking nature now with planned grazing  and they have documented a    percent increase in the production of the land in the first year. We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture. Ninety five percent of that land can only feed people from animals. I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land here that controls our fate  including the most violent region of the world  where only animals can feed people from about    percent of the land. What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as  I believe  fossil fuels  and maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that  it is causing hunger  poverty  violence  social breakdown and war  and as I am talking to you  millions of men  women and children are suffering and dying. And if this continues  we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing  even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels. I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. We are already doing so on about    million hectares on five continents  and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that  for illustrative purposes  if we do what I am showing you here  we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years  and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands that I've shown you  we can take us back to pre industrial levels  while feeding people. I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet  for your children  and their children  and all of humanity. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you  Chris. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I have  and I'm sure everyone here has  A  a hundred questions  B  wants to hug you. I'm just going to ask you one quick question. When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals  it's desert. What do they eat  How does that part work  How do you start  Allan Savory  Well  we have done this for a long time  and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation  where it's     percent bare. But many years ago  we took the worst land in Zimbabwe  where I offered a    note in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred mile drive  and on that  we trebled the stocking rate  the number of animals  in the first year with no feeding  just by the movement  mimicking nature  and using a sigmoid curve  that principle. It's a little bit technical to explain here  but just that. CA  Well  I would love to    I mean  this such an interesting and important idea. The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and    I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS  Wonderful. CA  That is an astonishing talk  truly an astonishing talk  and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way. Thank you so much.AS  Well  thank you. Thank you. Thank you  Chris. The Kraken  a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales  and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island. In assessing the merits of such tales  it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins   Once upon a time   and a sea story begins   This ain't no shit.   Laughter  Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale. Nevertheless  there are giants in the ocean  and we now have video proof  as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware. I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan. I'm the short one. The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea. I owe my participation in this now historic event to TED. In       there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish. I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean  one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away. Mike deGruy was also invited  and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean  and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time  which is the hunt for the giant squid. It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit  a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.  Laughter  I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet  unobtrusive platforms for exploration. This came out of hundreds of dives I have made  farting around in the dark using these platforms  and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote operated vehicles. But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view. But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana  two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems. So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make. So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean  and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made. The Johnson Sea Link     whirring noise     which you can probably just barely hear here  uses electric thrusters    very  very quiet. The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters. It's also pretty quiet  but a bit noisier.  Louder whirring noise  But most deep diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.  Loud beeping noise  I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away. So for the deep sea squid hunt  I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters  no motors  just a battery powered camera  and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue. That's visible to our eye  but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea. So this camera platform  which we called the Medusa  could just be thrown off the back of the ship  attached to a float at the surface with over       feet of line  it would just float around passively carried by the currents  and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure  which we called the electronic jellyfish  or e jelly  because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla. Now  this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense. The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish  but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape. It's a scream for help  a last ditch attempt for escape  and a common form of defense in the deep sea. The approach worked. Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant  we managed six  and the first triggered wild excitement. Edith Widder  on video   Oh my God. Oh my God  Are you kidding me Other scientists  Oh ho ho  That's just hanging there. EW  It was like it was teasing us  doing a kind of fan dance    now you see me  now you don't    and we had four such teasing appearances  and then on the fifth  it came in and totally wowed us. Scientists  Ooh. Bang  Oh my God  Whoa  EW  The full monty. What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it  which I think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly. But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible. What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used  a one meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it  a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use  and I think it was this light that brought the giant in. Now  what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light  and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here. And then he got so excited  he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better  and the giant didn't run away  so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible  bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high resolution video. It was absolutely breathtaking  and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended  it would have been as tall as a two story house. How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now  We've only explored about five percent of our ocean. There are great discoveries yet to be made down there  fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine. Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration. We need a NASA like organization for ocean exploration  because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth. We need   thank you.  Applause  Exploration is the engine that drives innovation. Innovation drives economic growth. So let's all go exploring  but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away  or  as Mike deGruy once said   If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen  or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen  get in a sub.  He should have been with us for this adventure. We miss him. I live in South Central. This is South Central  liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. So the city planners  they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else  so they change it to South Los Angeles  like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. This is South Los Angeles.  Laughter  Liquor stores  fast food  vacant lots. Just like   .  million other Americans  I live in a food desert  South Central Los Angeles  home of the drive thru and the drive by. Funny thing is  the drive thrus are killing more people than the drive bys. People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. For instance  the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than  say  Beverly Hills  which is probably eight     miles away. I got tired of seeing this happening. And I was wondering  how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood  I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. And I figured  this has to stop. So I figured that the problem is the solution. Food is the problem and food is the solution. Plus I got tired of driving    minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. So what I did  I planted a food forest in front of my house. It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. It's     feet by    feet. Thing is  it's owned by the city. But you have to maintain it. So I'm like   Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want  since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it.  And this is how I decided to maintain it. So me and my group  L.A. Green Grounds  we got together and we started planting my food forest  fruit trees  you know  the whole nine  vegetables. What we do  we're a pay it forward kind of group  where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life  from all over the city  and it's completely volunteer  and everything we do is free. And the garden  it was beautiful. And then somebody complained. The city came down on me  and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden  which this citation was turning into a warrant. And I'm like   Come on  really  A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about    Laughter  And I was like   Cool. Bring it.  Because this time it wasn't coming up. So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman  and one of the Green Grounds members  they put up a petition on Change.org  and with     signatures  we were a success. We had a victory on our hands. My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. I mean  come on  why wouldn't they  L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. They own    square miles of vacant lots. That's    Central Parks. That's enough space to plant     million tomato plants. Why in the hell would they not okay this  Growing one plant will give you               seeds. When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you    dollars' worth of produce. It's my gospel  when I'm telling people  grow your own food. Growing your own food is like printing your own money. See  I have a legacy in South Central. I grew up there. I raised my sons there. And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people  and I'm manufacturing my own reality. See  I'm an artist. Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. Just like a graffiti artist  where they beautify walls  me  I beautify lawns  parkways. I use the garden  the soil  like it's a piece of cloth  and the plants and the trees  that's my embellishment for that cloth. You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. So what happened  I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education  a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. To change the community  you have to change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do  especially in the inner city. Plus you get strawberries. I remember this time  there was this mother and a daughter came  it was  like        at night  and they were in my yard  and I came out and they looked so ashamed. So I'm like  man  it made me feel bad that they were there  and I told them  you know  you don't have to do this like this. This is on the street for a reason. It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry  and this only reinforced why I do this  and people asked me   Fin  aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food   And I'm like   Hell no  I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. That's why it's on the street. That's the whole idea. I want them to take it  but at the same time  I want them to take back their health.  There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. These are the guys  they helped me unload the truck. It was cool  and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother  and it was just cool to see how this changed them  if it was only for that one moment. So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe    gardens. We've had  like     people come to our dig ins and participate  and it's all volunteers. If kids grow kale  kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes  they eat tomatoes.  Applause  But when none of this is presented to them  if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body  they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. I see young people and they want to work  but they're in this thing where they're caught up    I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them  that leads them to nowhere. So with gardening  I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities  to have a sustainable life. And when we do this  who knows  We might produce the next George Washington Carver. but if we don't change the composition of the soil  we will never do this. Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about no free shit  because free is not sustainable. The funny thing about sustainability  you have to sustain it. What I'm talking about is putting people to work  and getting kids off the street  and letting them know the joy  the pride and the honor in growing your own food  opening farmer's markets. So what I want to do here  we gotta make this sexy. So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades  gangstas  gangsta gardeners. We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. If you ain't a gardener  you ain't gangsta. Get gangsta with your shovel  okay  And let that be your weapon of choice. So basically  if you want to meet with me  you know  if you want to meet  don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit    where you talk about doing some shit. If you want to meet with me  come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. Peace. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  There's a group of people in Kenya. People cross oceans to go see them. These people are tall. They jump high. They wear red. And they kill lions. You might be wondering  who are these people  These are the Maasais. And you know what's cool  I'm actually one of them. The Maasais  the boys are brought up to be warriors. The girls are brought up to be mothers. When I was five years old  I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty. My mother  my grandmother  my aunties  they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by. And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age   . My day started at   in the morning  milking the cows  sweeping the house  cooking for my siblings  collecting water  firewood. I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife. I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school. It's because my mother was denied an education  and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living. Why did she say that  My father worked as a policeman in the city. He came home once a year. We didn't see him for sometimes even two years. And whenever he came home  it was a different case. My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat. She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us. But when my father came  he would sell the cows  he would sell the products we had  and he went and drank with his friends in the bars. Because my mother was a woman  she was not allowed to own any property  and by default  everything in my family anyway belongs to my father  so he had the right. And if my mother ever questioned him  he beat her  abused her  and really it was difficult. When I went to school  I had a dream. I wanted to become a teacher. Teachers looked nice. They wear nice dresses  high heeled shoes. I found out later that they are uncomfortable  but I admired it. But most of all  the teacher was just writing on the board    not hard work  that's what I thought  compared to what I was doing in the farm. So I wanted to become a teacher. I worked hard in school  but when I was in eighth grade  it was a determining factor. In our tradition  there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women  and it's a rite of passage to womanhood. And then I was just finishing my eighth grade  and that was a transition for me to go to high school. This was the crossroad. Once I go through this tradition  I was going to become a wife. Well  my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass. So I talked    I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out. I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done. I told my father   I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school.  The reason why  if I ran away  my father will have a stigma  people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony. It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life. So he figured out.  Well   he said   okay  you'll go to school after the ceremony.  I did. The ceremony happened. It's a whole week long of excitement. It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it. And the day before the actual ceremony happens  we were dancing  having excitement  and through all the night we did not sleep. The actual day came  and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in. Yes  we danced and danced. We walked out to the courtyard  and there were a bunch of people waiting. They were all in a circle. And as we danced and danced  and we approached this circle of women  men  women  children  everybody was there. There was a woman sitting in the middle of it  and this woman was waiting to hold us. I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls  and as I approached her  she looked at me  and I sat down. And I sat down  and I opened my legs. As I opened my leg  another woman came  and this woman was carrying a knife. And as she carried the knife  she walked toward me and she held the clitoris  and she cut it off. As you can imagine  I bled. I bled. After bleeding for a while  I fainted thereafter. It's something that so many girls    I'm lucky  I never died    but many die. It's practiced  it's no anesthesia  it's a rusty old knife  and it was difficult. I was lucky because one  also  my mom did something that most women don't do. Three days later  after everybody has left the home  my mom went and brought a nurse. We were taken care of. Three weeks later  I was healed  and I was back in high school. I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family. Well  while I was in high school  something happened. I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon. This man was wearing a white t shirt  jeans  camera  white sneakers    and I'm talking about white sneakers. There is something about clothes  I think  and shoes. They were sneakers  and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive. I told him   Well  I want to go to where you are   because this man looked very happy  and I admired that. And he told me   Well  what do you mean  you want to go  Don't you have a husband waiting for you   And I told him   Don't worry about that part. Just tell me how to get there.  This gentleman  he helped me. While I was in high school also  my dad was sick. He got a stroke  and he was really  really sick  so he really couldn't tell me what to do next. But the problem is  my father is not the only father I have. Everybody who is my dad's age  male in the community  is my father by default    my uncles  all of them    and they dictate what my future is. So the news came  I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg  Virginia  and I couldn't come without the support of the village  because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket. I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here. But I needed the support of the village  and here again  when the men heard  and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school  they said   What a lost opportunity. This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this.  So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition. There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news. So I had to come up with something to do with the morning  because there's good news in the morning. And in the village also  there is one chief  an elder  who if he says yes  everybody will follow him. So I went to him very early in the morning  as the sun rose. The first thing he sees when he opens his door is  it's me.  My child  what are you doing here    Well  Dad  I need help. Can you support me to go to America   I promised him that I would be the best girl  I will come back  anything they wanted after that  I will do it for them. He said   Well  but I can't do it alone.  He gave me a list of another    men that I went       more men    every single morning I went and visited them. They all came together. The village  the women  the men  everybody came together to support me to come to get an education. I arrived in America. As you can imagine  what did I find  I found snow  I found Wal Marts  vacuum cleaners  and lots of food in the cafeteria. I was in a land of plenty. I enjoyed myself  but during that moment while I was here  I discovered a lot of things. I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was    years old  it was called female genital mutilation. I learned that it was against the law in Kenya. I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education. I had a right. And as we speak right now  three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation. I learned that my mom had a right to own property. I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman. Those things made me angry. I wanted to do something. As I went back  every time I went  I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married. They were getting mutilated  and here  after I graduated from here  I worked at the U.N.  I went back to school to get my graduate work  the constant cry of these girls was in my face. I had to do something. As I went back  I started talking to the men  to the village  and mothers  and I said   I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you. What do you need   As I spoke to the women  they told me   You know what we need  We really need a school for girls.  Because there had not been any school for girls. And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school  the mother is blamed for that. If she got pregnant before she got married  the mother is blamed for that  and she's punished. She's beaten. They said   We wanted to put our girls in a safe place.  As we moved  and I went to talk to the fathers  the fathers  of course  you can imagine what they said   We want a school for boys.  And I said   Well  there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education. Why can't they build a school for boys  and I'll build a school for girls   That made sense. And they agreed. And I told them  I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment. And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school. We have. I want you to meet one of the girls in that school. Angeline came to apply for the school  and she did not meet any criteria that we had. She's an orphan. Yes  we could have taken her for that. But she was older. She was    years old  and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade. Angeline had been moving from one place    because she's an orphan  she has no mother  she has no father    moving from one grandmother's house to another one  from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life. And I looked at her  I remember that day  and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline. And yes  she was older to be in fourth grade. We gave her the opportunity to come to the class. Five months later  that is Angeline. A transformation had begun in her life. Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference. She was not the top student when we took her. Now she's the best student  not just in our school  but in the entire division that we are in. That's Sharon. That's five years later. That's Evelyn. Five months later  that is the difference that we are making. As a new dawn is happening in my school  a new beginning is happening. As we speak right now      girls will never be mutilated. One hundred twenty five girls will not be married when they're    years old. One hundred twenty five girls are creating and achieving their dreams. This is the thing that we are doing  giving them opportunities where they can rise. As we speak right now  women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community. I want to challenge you today. You are listening to me because you are here  very optimistic. You are somebody who is so passionate. You are somebody who wants to see a better world. You are somebody who wants to see that war ends  no poverty. You are somebody who wants to make a difference. You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better. I want to challenge you today that to be the first  because people will follow you. Be the first. People will follow you. Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident. Move out  because as you change your world  as you change your community  as we believe that we are impacting one girl  one family  one village  one country at a time. We are making a difference  so if you change your world  you are going to change your community  you are going to change your country  and think about that. If you do that  and I do that  aren't we going to create a better future for our children  for your children  for our grandchildren  And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much. There's so many of you. When I was a kid  I hid my heart under the bed  because my mother said   If you're not careful  someday someone's going to break it.  Take it from me  Under the bed is not a good hiding spot. I know because I've been shot down so many times  I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself. But that's what we were told.  Stand up for yourself.  And that's hard to do if you don't know who you are. We were expected to define ourselves at such an early age  and if we didn't do it  others did it for us. Geek. Fatty. Slut. Fag. And at the same time we were being told what we were  we were being asked   What do you want to be when you grow up   I always thought that was an unfair question. It presupposes that we can't be what we already are. We were kids. When I was a kid  I wanted to be a man. I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet. When I was a kid  I wanted to shave. Now  not so much. When I was eight  I wanted to be a marine biologist. When I was nine  I saw the movie  Jaws   and thought to myself   No  thank you.  And when I was     I was told that my parents left because they didn't want me. When I was     I wanted to be left alone. When I was     I wanted to die. When I was     I wanted to kill a kid. When I was     I was asked to seriously consider a career path. I said   I'd like to be a writer.  And they said   Choose something realistic.  So I said   Professional wrestler.  And they said   Don't be stupid.  See  they asked me what I wanted to be  then told me what not to be. And I wasn't the only one. We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not  sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be. I was being told to accept the identity that others will give me. And I wondered  what made my dreams so easy to dismiss  Granted  my dreams are shy  because they're Canadian. My dreams are self conscious and overly apologetic. They're standing alone at the high school dance  and they've never been kissed. See  my dreams got called names too. Silly. Foolish. Impossible. But I kept dreaming. I was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out. I was going to be The Garbage Man. My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor. My saying was going to be   I'm taking out the trash   And then this guy  Duke  The Dumpster  Droese  stole my entire shtick. I was crushed  as if by a trash compactor. I thought to myself   What now  Where do I turn   Poetry. Like a boomerang  the thing I loved came back to me. One of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded I hate myself. From age    to     I hated myself for becoming the thing that I loathed  a bully. When I was     I wrote   I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite.  Standing up for yourself doesn't have to mean embracing violence. When I was a kid  I traded in homework assignments for friendship  then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time  and in most cases  not at all. I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise. And I remember this plan  born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me  Yogi   then pointed at my tummy and said   Too many picnic baskets.  Turns out it's not that hard to trick someone  and one day before class  I said   Yeah  you can copy my homework   and I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before. He got his paper back expecting a near perfect score  and couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero. I knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of    out of     but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me  puzzled  and I thought to myself   Smarter than the average bear  motherfucker.  This is who I am. This is how I stand up for myself. When I was a kid  I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both pork chops. My grandmother thought it was cute  and because they were my favorite  she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day  before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees  I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body. I didn't want to tell my grandmother because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn't have been. The gym teacher noticed the bruise  and I got sent to the principal's office. From there  I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned  life was pretty good. I told her  whenever I'm sad  my grandmother gives me karate chops. This led to a full scale investigation  and I was removed from the house for three days  until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school  and I earned my first nickname  Porkchop. To this day  I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way  surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones  as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called  and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us  that we'd be lonely forever  that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed. So broken heartstrings bled the blues  and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone  that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away  that there's no way for it to metastasize  it does. She was eight years old  our first day of grade three when she got called ugly. We both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs. But the school halls were a battleground. We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess  because outside was worse. Outside  we'd have to rehearse running away  or learn to stay still like statues  giving no clues that we were there. In grade five  they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read   Beware of dog.  To this day  despite a loving husband  she doesn't think she's beautiful  because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face. Kids used to say   She looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase  but couldn't quite get the job done.  And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word  Mom   because they see her heart before they see her skin  because she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree  adopted  not because his parents opted for a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy  started therapy in eighth grade  had a personality made up of tests and pills  lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs  four fifths suicidal  a tidal wave of antidepressants  and an adolescent being called  Popper   one part because of the pills     parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade    when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him   Get over it.  As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day  he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends  could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it's about to fall  and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration  he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes being drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day  kids are still being called names. The classics were  Hey  stupid    Hey  spaz.  Seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year. And if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear  do they make a sound  Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat  when people say things like   Kids can be cruel.  Every school was a big top circus tent  and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers  from clowns to carnies  all of these miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks    lobster claw boys and bearded ladies  oddities juggling depression and loneliness  playing solitaire  spin the bottle  trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal  but at night  while the others slept  we kept walking the tightrope. It was practice  and yes  some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be  and if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself  get a better mirror  look a little closer  stare a little longer  because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself   They were wrong.  Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell  but never told  because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it  You have to believe that they were wrong. They have to be wrong. Why else would we still be here  We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called. We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway  and if in some way we are  don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of We Made It  not the faded echoes of voices crying out   Names will never hurt me.  Of course they did. But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty. I want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship. I happen to have triplets. They're little. They're five years old. Sometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say   Really  How many   Here's a picture of the kids    that's Sage  and Annalisa and Rider. Now  I also happen to be gay. Being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative  socially entrepreneurial thing I have ever done. The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity. I want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector  are actually undermining the causes we love  and our profound yearning to change the world. But before I do that  I want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world. A lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies  and social business will take care of the rest. And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward. But it always leaves behind that    percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky. And social business needs markets  and there are some issues for which you just can't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market. I sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled  and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love. How do you monetize that  And that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in. Philanthropy is the market for love. It is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming. And so if we really want  like Buckminster Fuller said  a world that works for everyone  with no one and nothing left out  then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation. But it doesn't seem to be working. Why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer  or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city  Why has poverty remained stuck at    percent of the U.S. population for    years  And the answer is  these social problems are massive in scale  our organizations are tiny up against them  and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny. We have two rulebooks. We have one for the nonprofit sector  and one for the rest of the economic world. It's an apartheid  and it discriminates against the nonprofit sector in five different areas  the first being compensation. So in the for profit sector  the more value you produce  the more money you can make. But we don't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service. We have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people. Interestingly  we don't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people. You know  you want to make    million dollars selling violent video games to kids  go for it. We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine. But you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria  and you're considered a parasite yourself. And we think of this as our system of ethics  but what we don't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect  which is  It gives a really stark  mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world  to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities  and sends tens of thousands of people who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector  marching every year directly into the for profit sector because they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice. Businessweek did a survey  looked at the compensation packages for MBAs    years out of business school. And the median compensation for a Stanford MBA  with bonus  at the age of     was         dollars. Meanwhile  for the same year  the average salary for the CEO of a    million plus medical charity in the U.S. was         dollars  and for a hunger charity         dollars. Now  there's no way you're going to get a lot of people with          talent to make a          sacrifice every year to become the CEO of a hunger charity. Some people say   Well  that's just because those MBA types are greedy.  Not necessarily. They might be smart. It's cheaper for that person to donate         dollars every year to the hunger charity  save        dollars on their taxes    so still be roughly         dollars a year ahead of the game    now be called a philanthropist because they donated         dollars to charity  probably sit on the board of the hunger charity  indeed  probably supervise the poor SOB who decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity  and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them. The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing. So we tell the for profit sector   Spend  spend  spend on advertising  until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value.  But we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity. Our attitude is   Well  look  if you can get the advertising donated  you know  to air at four o'clock in the morning  I'm okay with that. But I don't want my donation spent on advertising  I want it go to the needy.  As if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy. In the     s  my company created the long distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys  and the    mile long breast cancer three day walks  and over the course of nine years  we had         ordinary heroes participate  and they raised a total of     million dollars. They raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history  all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do. People are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply. But they have to be asked. We got that many people to participate by buying full page ads in The New York Times  in The Boston Globe  in prime time radio and TV advertising. Do you know how many people we would've gotten if we put up fliers in the laundromat  Charitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S.  at two percent of GDP  ever since we started measuring it in the     s. That's an important fact  because it tells us that in    years  the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for profit sector. And if you think about it  how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it isn't really allowed to market  And if we tell the consumer brands   You may advertise all the benefits of your product   but we tell charities   You cannot advertise all the good that you do   where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow  The third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue. So Disney can make a new      million movie that flops  and nobody calls the attorney general. But you do a little    million community fundraiser for the poor  and it doesn't produce a    percent profit to the cause in the first    months  and your character is called into question. So nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave  daring  giant scale new fundraising endeavors  for fear that if the thing fails  their reputations will be dragged through the mud. Well  you and I know when you prohibit failure  you kill innovation. If you kill innovation in fundraising  you can't raise more revenue  if you can't raise more revenue  you can't grow  and if you can't grow  you can't possibly solve large social problems. The fourth area is time. So Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors  and people had patience. They knew that there was a long term objective down the line  of building market dominance. But if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years  no money was going to go to the needy  it was all going to be invested in building this scale  we would expect a crucifixion. The last area is profit itself. So the for profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas  but you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector  so the for profit sector has a lock on the multi trillion dollar capital markets  and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital. Well  you put those five things together    you can't use money to lure talent away from the for profit sector  you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for profit sector does for new customers  you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for profit sector takes  you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for profit sector  and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this  even if you could do it in the first place    and you've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for profit sector  on every level. If we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book  this statistic is sobering  From      to       the number of nonprofits that really grew  that crossed the     million annual revenue barrier  is    . In the same time  the number of for profits that crossed it is       . So we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale  and our organizations can't generate any scale. All of the scale goes to Coca Cola and Burger King. So why do we think this way  Well  like most fanatical dogma in America  these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs. The Puritans came here for religious reasons  or so they said  but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money. They were pious people  but they were also really aggressive capitalists  and they were accused of extreme forms of profit making tendencies  compared to the other colonists. But at the same time  the Puritans were Calvinists  so they were taught literally to hate themselves. They were taught that self interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation. This created a real problem for these people. Here they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money  but making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell. What were they to do about this  Well  charity became their answer. It became this economic sanctuary  where they could do penance for their profit making tendencies    at five cents on the dollar. So of course  how could you make money in charity if charity was your penance for making money  Financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others  so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself  and in     years  nothing has intervened to say   That's counterproductive and that's unfair.  Now  this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question  which is   What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead   There are a lot of problems with this question. I'm going to just focus on two. First  it makes us think that overhead is a negative  that it is somehow not part of the cause. But it absolutely is  especially if it's being used for growth. Now  this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second  much larger problem  which is  it forces organizations to go without the overhead things they really need to grow  in the interest of keeping overhead low. So we've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that  well  the less money you spend on fundraising  the more money there is available for the cause. Well  that's true if it's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger. But if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger  then we have it precisely backwards  and we should be investing more money  not less  in fundraising  because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply. I'll give you two examples. We launched the AIDSRides with an initial investment of        dollars in risk capital. Within nine years  we had multiplied that       times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for AIDS services. We launched the breast cancer three days with an initial investment of         dollars in risk capital. Within just five years  we had multiplied that     times  into     million dollars after all expenses  for breast cancer research. Now  if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer  what would make more sense  go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her         dollars for research  or give her fundraising department the         dollars to multiply it into     million dollars for breast cancer research       was our most successful year ever. We netted for breast cancer alone  that year alone     million dollars after all expenses. And then we went out of business  suddenly and traumatically. Why  Well  the short story is  our sponsors split on us. They wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing    percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience  and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future  other than this demonic label of  overhead.  So on one day  all     of our great employees lost their jobs ... because they were labeled  overhead.  Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own. The overhead went up. Net income for breast cancer research went down by    percent  or    million dollars  in one year. This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality. We've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with    percent overhead  but we're missing the most important piece of information  which is  What is the actual size of these pies  Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny  What if the bake sale only netted    dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted    million dollars because it did  Now which pie would we prefer  and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer  Here's how all of this impacts the big picture. I said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States. That's about     billion dollars a year. But only about    percent of that  or    billion dollars  goes to health and human services causes. The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals  and that    billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems. But if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP  up just one step to three percent of GDP  by investing in that growth  that would be an extra     billion dollars a year in contributions  and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities  because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth  that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector. Now we're talking scale. Now we're talking the potential for real change. But it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low. Our generation does not want its epitaph to read   We kept charity overhead low.  We want it to read that we changed the world  and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things. So the next time you're looking at a charity  don't ask about the rate of their overhead. Ask about the scale of their dreams  their Apple   Google   Amazon scale dreams  how they measure their progress toward those dreams  and what resources they need to make them come true  regardless of what the overhead is. Who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved  If we can have that kind of generosity    a generosity of thought    then the non profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens most desperately in need of it to change. And if that can be our generation's enduring legacy    that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us  that we revisited it  we revised it  and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things  forever  for everyone    well  I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be. Annalisa Smith Pallotta  That would be Sage Smith Pallotta  a real social Rider Smith Pallotta  innovation. Dan Pallotta  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. So raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness. Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised. And raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans. Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised. I can see I've got my work cut out for me here. As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning  psychiatric disorders like autism  depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering. We know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body. Think about it  In       the second decade of the millennium  if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor  you get bone scans  biopsies and blood tests. In       if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis  you go to your doctor  and what do you get  A questionnaire. Now  part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. We tend to view them    and the popular press aids and abets this view    as chemical imbalances in the brain  as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine  serotonin and norepinephrine. This view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders  like Prozac  act by globally changing brain chemistry  as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup. But that can't be the answer  because these drugs actually don't work all that well. A lot of people won't take them  or stop taking them  because of their unpleasant side effects. These drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block. Some of it will dribble into the right place  but a lot of it will do more harm than good. Now  an emerging view that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning  is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion  mood and affect. When we think about cognition  we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem. Well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion. It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way. But we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis. Now  it's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders. It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup. Rather  they're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain. So if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders  we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act. Otherwise  we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences. Now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry  it's helpful to work on what we biologists call  model organisms   animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice  in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons  as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning. Moreover  once we can do that  we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons. So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron  and we find that a behavior is blocked  we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior. On the other hand  if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces the behavior  we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior. So in this way  by doing this kind of test  we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors  something that is extremely difficult  if not impossible  to do right now in humans. But can an organism like a fruit fly  which is    it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain  it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors  it breeds quickly  and it's cheap. But can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion like states  Do these organisms even have emotion like states  or are they just little digital robots  Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors  as he wrote in his      monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals. And my eponymous colleague  Seymour Benzer  believed it as well. Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at CalTech in the '  s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior. Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late     s. He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here  and Seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science. So how do we ask this question  It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion like states  but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not  Now  in humans we often infer emotional states  as you'll hear later today  from facial expressions. However  it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies. It's kind of like landing on Mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out   How do I find out if they have emotions or not   What can we do  It's not so easy. Well  one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion like states such as arousal  and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties. So three important ones that I can think of are persistence  gradations in intensity  and valence. Persistence means long lasting. We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone. Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like. You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion. If you're a little bit unhappy  the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle  and if you're very unhappy  tears pour down your face and you might sob. Valence means good or bad  positive or negative. So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table  you know  the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away  and it seems to keep getting irritated. So we built a device  which we call a puff o mat  in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away. And what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff o mat several puffs in a row  they became somewhat hyperactive and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down. So we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona  who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech. And what this quantification showed us is that  upon experiencing a train of these air puffs  the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent  long lasting  and also appears to be graded. More puffs  or more intense puffs  make the state last for a longer period of time. So now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state. So we decided to use our puff o mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs. And this is one of the great things about fruit flies. There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation. So doing the screen  we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs  and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation  it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor. That's right    flies  like people  have dopamine  and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have. Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain  including in attention  arousal  reward  and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse  Parkinson's disease  and ADHD. Now  in genetics  it's a little counterintuitive. We tend to infer the normal function of something by what doesn't happen when we take it away  by the opposite of what we see when we take it away. So when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down  from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff. And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD  which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans. Indeed  if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate DEA license   oh my God     Laughter    we find indeed that these cocaine fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do  and that's also reminiscent of ADHD  which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin that act similarly to cocaine. So slowly I began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder. Now  how far does this analogy go  As many of you know  individuals afflicted with ADHD also have learning disabilities. Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies  Remarkably  the answer is yes. As Seymour showed back in the     s  flies  like songbirds  as you just heard  are capable of learning. You can train a fly to avoid an odor  shown here in blue  if you pair that odor with a shock. Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock paired odor and another odor  it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock. Well  if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies  they don't learn. Their learning score is zero. They flunk out of CalTech. So that means that these flies have two abnormalities  or phenotypes  as we geneticists call them  that one finds in ADHD  hyperactivity and learning disability. Now what's the causal relationship  if anything  between these phenotypes  In ADHD  it's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability. The kids can't sit still long enough to focus  so they don't learn. But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity. Because the kids can't learn  they look for other things to distract their attention. And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity  but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD. Now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans  but in flies we can actually test this. And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics. We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore  or cure  the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain. But in each fly  we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others  and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity. Remarkably  we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities. If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex  the flies are no longer hyperactive  but they still can't learn. On the other hand  if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body  the learning deficit is rescued  the flies learn well  but they're still hyperactive. What that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup. Rather  it's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits  so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain. Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans we don't know  but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility. So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup  and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup. What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders. If we can do that  we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects  putting the oil back in our mental engines  just where it's needed. Thank you very much. Now  extinction is a different kind of death. It's bigger. We didn't really realize that until       when the last passenger pigeon  a female named Martha  died at the Cincinnati zoo. This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years. Suddenly it wasn't here at all. Flocks that were a mile wide and     miles long used to darken the sun. Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm  a feathered tempest. And indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest  from the Mississippi to the Atlantic  from Canada down to the Gulf. But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades. What happened  Well  commercial hunting happened. These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton  and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground  they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands. It was the cheapest source of protein in America. By the end of the century  there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers. There's an upside to the story. This made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the American bison  and so these birds saved the buffalos. But a lot of other animals weren't saved. The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere. It was hunted to death for its feathers. There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen. It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. A local newspaper spelled out   There is no survivor  there is no future  there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again.  There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things  and it happened to lots of birds that people loved. It happened to lots of mammals. Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. There was sort of a movie made about it recently. And the aurochs was like the bison. This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent  from Spain to Korea. The documentation of this animal goes back to the Lascaux cave paintings. The extinctions still go on. There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo. It went extinct in     . There was a marvelous animal  a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in Tasmania  south of Australia  called the Tasmanian tiger. It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. A little bit of film was shot. Sorrow  anger  mourning. Don't mourn. Organize. What if you could find out that  using the DNA in museum specimens  fossils maybe up to         years old could be used to bring species back  what would you do  Where would you start  Well  you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there. I started with my wife  Ryan Phelan  who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct  and through her  one of her colleagues  George Church  one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed. So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons  conservation ornithologists  bioethicists  and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro. All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue  because down in there is what is called ancient DNA. It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented  but with good techniques now  you can basically reassemble the whole genome. Then the question is  can you reassemble  with that genome  the whole bird  George Church thinks you can. So in his book   Regenesis   which I recommend  he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species  and he has a machine called the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine. It's kind of like an evolution machine. You try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip  and the ones that win  that you can then put into a living organism. It'll work. The precision of this  one of George's famous unreadable slides  nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair. The passenger pigeon has  .  billion base pairs in its genome. So what you're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene. It's called an allele. Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway. So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative. Now along the way  George points out that his technology  the technology of synthetic biology  is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law. It's been doing that since       and it's likely to continue. Okay  the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here. Genetically  the band tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon. There's just some bits that are band tailed pigeon. If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits  you've got the extinct bird back  cooing at you. Now  there's work to do. You have to figure out exactly what genes matter. So there's genes for the short tail in the band tailed pigeon  genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon  and so on with the red eye  peach colored breast  flocking  and so on. Add them all up and the result won't be perfect. But it should be be perfect enough  because nature doesn't do perfect either. So this meeting in Boston led to three things. First off  Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit called Revive and Restore that would push de extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way  and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon. Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak  who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was    and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA  himself sequenced the passenger pigeon  using money from his family and friends. We hired him full time. Now  this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian  he's looking down at Martha  the last passenger pigeon alive. So if he's successful  she won't be the last. The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de extinction  but they'd never met each other. And National Geographic got interested because National Geographic has the theory that the last century  discovery was basically finding things  and in this century  discovery is basically making things. De extinction falls in that category. So they hosted and funded this meeting. And    scientists  they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists  basically meeting to see if they had work to do together. Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical. There's three of them who are not just re creating ancient species  they're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern Siberia  in the Netherlands  and in Hawaii. Henri  from the Netherlands  with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce  is working on the aurochs. The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle  and so basically its genome is alive  it's just unevenly distributed. So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive  hardy looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild  over time  with selective back breeding  the aurochs. Now  re wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America  and so the plan is  with these re wilded areas all over Europe  they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job  its old ecological role  of clearing the somewhat barren  closed canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it. Another amazing story came from Alberto Fern ndez Arias. Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain. The last bucardo was a female named Celia who was still alive  but then they captured her  they got a little bit of tissue from her ear  they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen  released her back into the wild  but a few months later  she was found dead under a fallen tree. They took the DNA from that ear  they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat  the pregnancy came to term  and a live baby bucardo was born. It was the first de extinction in history. It was short lived. Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems. This one had a malformed lung and died after    minutes  but Alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then  and this will move ahead  and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern Spain. Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder. At the San Diego zoo  his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over       species over the last    years. Now  when it's frozen that deep  minus     degrees Celsius  the cells are intact and the DNA is intact. They're basically viable cells  so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the Javan banteng  put it in a cow  the cow went to term  and what was born was a live  healthy baby Javan banteng  who thrived and is still alive. The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells and turn it into germ cells  like sperm and eggs. So now we go to Mike McGrew who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland  and Mike's doing miracles with birds. So he'll take  say  falcon skin cells  fibroblast  turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells. Since it's so pluripotent  it can become germ plasm. He then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have  basically  the gonads of a falcon. You get a male and a female each of those  and out of them comes falcons. Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens. Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting. He showed how all of this can be put together. The sequence of events  he'll put together the genomes of the band tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon  he'll take the techniques of George Church and get passenger pigeon DNA  the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew  get that DNA into chicken gonads  and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs  squabs  and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons. It does raise the question of  they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon. So what do you do about that  Well birds are pretty hard wired  as it happens  so most of that is already in their DNA  but to supplement it  part of Ben's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds. There were some conservationists  really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple  who is one of the founders of conservation biology  and Kate Jones from the IUCN  which does the Red List. They're excited about all this  but they're also concerned that it might be competitive with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive  that haven't gone extinct yet. You see  you want to work on protecting the animals out there. You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down so you're not using        elephants a year. But at the same time  conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out. And so the Red List is really important  keep track of what's endangered and critically endangered  and so on. But they're about to create what they call a Green List  and the Green List will have species that are doing fine  thank you  species that were endangered  like the bald eagle  but they're much better off now  thanks to everybody's good work  and protected areas around the world that are very  very well managed. So basically  they're learning how to build on good news. And they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on. Here's a couple related examples. Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species. The California condor was down to    birds in     . Everybody thought is was finished. Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo  there's     of them now      are out in the wild. That technology will be used on de extincted animals. Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa. In       Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct. There were just     left. Now there are    . They're increasing in population by three percent a year. The secret is  they have an eco tourism program  which is absolutely brilliant. So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan with an iPhone. That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors. Another interesting project  though it's going to need some help  is the northern white rhinoceros. There's no breeding pairs left. But this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo. A bit of cloning  you can get them back. So where do we go from here  These have been private meetings so far. I think it's time for the subject to go public. What do people think about it  You know  do you want extinct species back  Do you want extinct species back  Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down. It is a Tinker Bell moment  because what are people excited about with this  What are they concerned about  We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon. So Ben Novak  even as we speak  is joining the group that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz. They're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band tailed pigeon. As that data matures  they'll send it to George Church  who will work his magic  get passenger pigeon DNA out of that. We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by band tailed pigeon parents  and then from then on  it's passenger pigeons all the way  maybe for the next six million years. You can do the same thing  as the costs come down  for the Carolina parakeet  for the great auk  for the heath hen  for the ivory billed woodpecker  for the Eskimo curlew  for the Caribbean monk seal  for the woolly mammoth. Because the fact is  humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last        years. We have the ability now  and maybe the moral obligation  to repair some of the damage. Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands  by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. But some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I've got a question. So  this is an emotional topic. Some people stand. I suspect there are some people out there sitting  kind of asking tormented questions  almost  about  well  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait a minute  there's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way. There's going to be unintended consequences. You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box of who knows what. Do they have a point  Stewart Brand  Well  the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct  and many of them were keystone species  and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go. Now  there's the shifting baseline problem  which is  so when these things come back  they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love. I think that's  you know  part of how it'll work. This is a long  slow process    One of the things I like about it  it's multi generation. We will get woolly mammoths back. CA  Well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling. Thank you so much for presenting. SB  Thank you. CA  Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last    years of anti poverty campaigning into    minutes for TED. That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct. I said   Chris  that would take a miracle.  He said   Bono  wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex   So  yeah. Then I thought  let's go even further than    years. Let's go back before Christ  three millennia  to a time when  at least in my head  the journey for justice  the march against inequality and poverty really began. Three thousand years ago  civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile  some slaves  Jewish shepherds in this instance  smelling of sheep shit  I guess  proclaimed to the Pharaoh  sitting high on his throne   We  your majesty ness  are equal to you.  And the Pharaoh replies   Oh  no. You  your miserableness  have got to be kidding.  And they say   No  no  that's what it says here in our holy book.  Cut to our century  same country  same pyramids  another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book. This time it's called the Facebook. Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square. They turn a social network from virtual to actual  and kind of rebooted the   st century. Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been  neither to oversell the role of technology  but these things have given a sense of what's possible when the age old model of power  the pyramid  gets turned upside down  putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom  as it were. It's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality  because facts  like people  want to be free  and when they're free  liberty is usually around the corner  even for the poorest of the poor    facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia  facts that tell us what's working and  more importantly  what's not  so we can fix it  facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made back in       when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity  extreme poverty  facts that build a powerful momentum. So I thought  forget the rock opera  forget the bombast  my usual tricks. The only thing singing today would be the facts  for I have truly embraced by inner nerd. So exit the rock star. Enter the evidence based activist  the factivist. Because what the facts are telling us is that the long  slow journey  humanity's long  slow journey of equality  is actually speeding up. Look at what's been achieved. Look at the pictures these data sets print. Since the year       since the turn of the millennium  there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs. Malaria  There are eight countries in sub Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by    percent. For kids under five  child mortality  kids under five  it's down by  .   million a year. That's a rate of       children's lives saved each day. Wow. Wow.  Applause  Let's just stop for a second  actually  and think about that. Have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number  Wow. Great news. It drives me nuts that most people don't seem to know this news. Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them. This is Michael and Benedicta  and they're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah    she's amazing    and the Global Fund  which all of you financially support  whether you know it or not. And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids. This fantastic news didn't happen by itself. It was fought for  it was campaigned for  it was innovated for. And this great news gives birth to even more great news  because the historic trend is this. The number of people living in back breaking  soul crushing extreme poverty has declined from    percent of the world's population in      to    percent by      and then to    percent by     . Give it up for that.  Applause  Halved. Halved. Now  the rate is still too high    still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives. There's still work to do. But it's heart stopping. It's mind blowing stuff. And if you live on less than   .   a day  if you live in that kind of poverty  this is not just data. This is everything. If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids    and I am    this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope. And guess what  If the trajectory continues  look where the amount of people living on   .   a day gets to by     . Can't be true  can it  That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues  we get to  wow  the zero zone. For number crunchers like us  that is the erogenous zone  and it's fair to say that I am  by now  sexually aroused by the collating of data. So virtual elimination of extreme poverty  as defined by people living on less than   .   a day  adjusted  of course  for inflation from a      baseline. We do love a good baseline. That's amazing. Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil    and who doesn't love a Brazilian model     but look at sub Saharan Africa. There's a collection of    countries  some call them the lions  who in the last decade have had a combination of     percent debt cancellation  a tripling of aid  a tenfold increase in FDI    that's foreign direct investment    which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources    that's local money    which  when spent wisely    that's good governance    cut childhood mortality by a third  doubled education completion rates  and they  too  halved extreme poverty  and at this rate  these    get to zero too. So the pride of lions is the proof of concept. There are all kinds of benefits to this. For a start  you won't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up Jesus like myself. How about that   Applause  And             It's just around the corner. I mean  it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away. Makes us look really young. So why aren't we jumping up and down about this  Well  the opportunity is real  but so is the jeopardy. We can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done. Look at this graph. It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up. And the next one is really beautiful. It's called momentum. And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero  just doing the things that we know work. So inertia versus momentum. There is jeopardy  and of course  the closer you get  it gets harder. We know the obstacles that are in our way right now  in difficult times. In fact  today in your capital  in difficult times  some who mind the nation's purse want to cut life saving programs like the Global Fund. But you can do something about that. You can tell politicians that these cuts  can cost  lives. Right now today  in Oslo as it happens  oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries. You can do something about that too. You can join the One Campaign  and leaders like Mo Ibrahim  the telecom entrepreneur. We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it. And right now  we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease. It's corruption. But there's a vaccine for that too. It's called transparency  open data sets  something the TED community is really on it. Daylight  you could call it  transparency. And technology is really turbocharging this. It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff. So let me tell you about the U report  which I'm really excited about. It's         millennials all across Uganda  young people armed with  G phones  an SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what's in the budget and how their money is being spent. This is exciting stuff. Look  once you have these tools  you can't not use them. Once you have this knowledge  you can't un know it. You can't delete this data from your brain  but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant  impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives. You can erase that  you really can  because it's not true anymore.  Applause  It's transformational.       By       robots  not just serving us Guinness  but drinking it. By the time we get there  every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way. So I'm here to    I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous  data based virus  the one we call factivism. It's not going to kill you. In fact  it could save countless lives. I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious  spread it  share it  pass it on. By doing so  you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken  the ever demanding journey of equality. Could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be  Might we answer that clarion call with science  with reason  with facts  and  dare I say it  emotions  Because as is obvious  factivists have feelings too. I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim  though. Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo. He got thrown in jail for it  but I have his words tattooed on my brain.  We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda. We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We are going to win because we have dreams  and we're willing to stand up for those dreams.  Wael is right. We're going to win if we work together as one  because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power. Thank you. Thank you so much.  Applause  I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family. He did it because he couldn't afford a car  but also because he knew how to build one. There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made  so we could build and repair them  or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy. Many of these do it yourself practices were lost in the second half of the   th century. But now  the maker community and the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they're made of back into our lives  and I believe we need to take them to the next level  to the components things are made of. For the most part  we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced. But now we have these amazing  futuristic composites    plastics that change shape  paints that conduct electricity  pigments that change color  fabrics that light up. Let me show you some examples. So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires. In the case of this little example I'm holding  we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light. Conductive ink has been used by artists  but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens. And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light diffusing particles. What this means is that  while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges  this one illuminates across the entire surface when I turn on the lights around it. Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi touch systems. And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature. So I'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens. So one of the principle applications for this material is  amongst other things  in baby bottles  so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink. So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials. In a few years  they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis. We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us  but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature  keyboards that roll up  and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch. So I'm a social scientist by training  so why am I here today talking about smart materials  Well first of all  because I am a maker. I'm curious about how things work and how they are made  but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world  and right now  we don't know enough about these high tech composites our future will be made of. Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities. There's barely any information available on how to use them  and very little is said about how they are produced. So for now  they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to. So a little over three years ago  Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials. It's a website where we  and anyone else who wants to join us  share experiments  publish information  encourage others to contribute whenever they can  and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves. We would like it to become a large  collectively generated database of do it yourself information on smart materials. But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of  First of all  because we can't shape what we don't understand  and what we don't understand and use ends up shaping us. The objects we use  the clothes we wear  the houses we live in  all have a profound impact on our behavior  health and quality of life. So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials  we should know and understand them. Secondly  and just as important  innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers. So many times  amateurs  not experts  have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors  personal computers  airplanes. The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment. But that's not always the case. Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink. Jordan Bunker  who had had no experience with chemistry until then  read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off the shelf substances and tools. He used a toaster oven  and he even made his own vortex mixer  based on a tutorial by another scientist maker. Jordan then published his results online  including all the things he had tried and didn't work  so others could study and reproduce it. So Jordan's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself. And now that he published this work  others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements. Another example I'd like to mention is Hannah Perner Wilson's Kit of No Parts. Her project's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder. Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work  but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. So Hannah's approach  on the other hand  is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves. So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments  this is one of my favorites.   Paper speakers   What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp  player and a magnet. So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT  Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. Just like Jordan and so many other makers  Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them. But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics. So Hannah's artisanal work  and the fact that she shared her findings  opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative. So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity  and we are not afraid to fail. We often tackle problems from unconventional angles  and  in the process  end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things. So the more people experiment with materials  the more researchers are willing to share their research  and manufacturers their knowledge  the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all. So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when  in the early     s  he wrote   You must understand computers now.  Back then  computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about  and no one dreamed of even having one at home. So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying   You must understand smart materials now.  Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future. Thank you. So  this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in     .  Laughter  Actually  it's deceptively large. There's actually only about    people on each page  because we have the name  address and telephone number of every single person. And  in fact  everybody's listed twice  because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. Obviously a very small community. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. I knew them both. We didn't all know each other  but we all kind of trusted each other  and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network  and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things. So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community  let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. Now  it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com. So I picked think.com  but then I thought  you know  there's a lot of really interesting names out there. Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. And then I thought   Nah  that wouldn't be very nice.  That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days  and in fact  it wasn't just the people on the network  but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself. So the basic idea of I.P.  or Internet protocol  and the way that the    the routing algorithm that used it  were fundamentally  from each according to their ability  to each according to their need.  And so  if you had some extra bandwidth  you'd deliver a message for someone. If they had some extra bandwidth  they would deliver a message for you. You'd kind of depend on people to do that  and that was the building block. It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department  but it obviously worked really well  and we all saw what happened with the Internet. It was incredibly successful. In fact  it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this. My rough calculation is it would be about    miles thick. But  of course  you couldn't do it  because we don't know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses  and even if we did know their names  I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name  address and telephone number published to everyone. So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days  and so we dealt with that by making walled communities  secure subnetworks  VPNs  little things that aren't really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks  but we're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust. And that means that it's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen  or certain kinds of deliberate attacks  but even the mistakes can be bad. So  for instance  in all of Asia recently  it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network. They didn't intend to screw up Asia  but they did because of the way that the protocols work. Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is  you may remember a couple of years ago  all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it. Now  you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet  and in some sense it doesn't. I'll come back to that later. But the fact is that people couldn't take off because something was going wrong on the Internet  and the router card was down. And so  there are many of those things that start to happen. Now  there was an interesting thing that happened last April. All of a sudden  a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet  including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations  started getting re routed through China. So for a few hours  it all passed through China. Now  China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake  and it is actually possible that it was  the way things work  but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to  and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes. Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks. So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days  they're not going to do it with tanks. That will not succeed. What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility. Nobody has claimed credit for that. There was basically a factory of industrial machines. It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet. It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet  but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there  or something like that  and software got in there that causes the centrifuges  in that case  to actually destroy themselves. Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant. And so there's a lot of    I'm sure you've read a lot in papers  about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those. But the fact is  people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet  and there's been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium. And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that  because it's actually kind of fragile. So actually  in the early days  back when it was the ARPANET  there were actually times    there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it. And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places  and this one processor  because of a broken card  decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time. So  in other words  it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it. So of course  the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy  who would send it back in time and get it there super early  so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node  and of course that clogged everything up. Everything started breaking. The interesting thing was  though  that the sysadmins were able to fix it  but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off. Now  of course you couldn't do that today. I mean  everything off  it's like the service call you get from the cable company  except for the whole world. Now  in fact  they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today. One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now  and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things  like when you take off from LAX  you're really not thinking you're using the Internet. When you pump gas  you really don't think you're using the Internet. What's happening increasingly  though  is these systems are beginning to use the Internet. Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet  but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions  for administrative functions  and so if you take something like the cell phone system  which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part  Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions  and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well  they're cheap  they're repeated  and so on. So all of our systems  more and more  are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology. And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that. So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it  but we're using it in a very  very different way than we expected to use it  and it's gotten a very  very different scale than it was designed for. And in fact  nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now. It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system  where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have. And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this  or it does do this  or it will do that  you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather  or something like that. They have an informed opinion  but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on. So if you see one of these maps of the Internet  it's just somebody's guess. Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago. It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring. And the problem with it is  I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system  where we take a system that's basically built on trust  was basically built for a smaller scale system  and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate. And so right now  I think it's literally true that we don't know what the consequences of an effective denial of service attack on the Internet would be  and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year  and worse next year  and so on. But so what we need is a plan B. There is no plan B right now. There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet  made out of completely different sets of building blocks. So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet  but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet  or the hospitals have to order fuel oil. This doesn't need to be a multi billion dollar government project. It's actually relatively simple to do  technically  because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground  existing wireless infrastructure. It's basically a matter of deciding to do it. But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it  and that's the problem that we have right now. So there's been plenty of people  plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years  but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well. So I think that  if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet  and how vulnerable it is  we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist  and I think if enough people say   Yeah  I would like to use it  I'd like to have such a system   then it will get built. It's not that hard a problem. It could definitely be done by people in this room. And so I think that this is actually  of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference  this is probably one of the very easiest to fix. So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Elon  what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all electric car  Elon Musk  Well  it goes back to when I was in university. I thought about  what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity  I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production. That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century  independent of environmental concerns. In fact  even if producing CO  was good for the environment  given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons  we need to find some sustainable means of operating. CA  Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help  EM  Right. There's two elements to that answer. One is that  even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars  you're still better off. So if you take  say  natural gas  which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel  if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine  you'll get about    percent efficiency. If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car  you get about    percent efficiency. And the reason is  in the stationary power plant  you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more  is voluminous  and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source. So in effect  even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything  even using the same source fuel  you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car  then burning it at the power plant. CA  That scale delivers efficiency. EM  Yes  it does. And then the other point is  we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway  electricity generation. So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation  then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport. CA  So we've got some video here of the Tesla being assembled  which  if we could play that first video    So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle  EM  Sure. So  in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport  and I should say that I think  actually  all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets. There's just no way around Newton's third law. The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport  And in order to do that for cars  you have to come up with a really energy efficient car  so that means making it incredibly light  and so what you're seeing here is the only all aluminum body and chassis car made in North America. In fact  we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack. And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size. So as a result  the energy usage is very low  and it has the most advanced battery pack  and that's what gives it the range that's competitive  so you can actually have on the order of a     mile range. CA  I mean  those battery packs are incredibly heavy  but you think the math can still work out intelligently    by combining light body  heavy battery  you can still gain spectacular efficiency. EM  Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack  and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range. And in fact  customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range. I think somebody recently got     miles out of a single charge. CA  Bruno Bowden  who's here  did that  broke the world record.EM  Congratulations. CA  That was the good news. The bad news was that to do it  he had to drive at    miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops.  Laughter  EM  I mean  you can certainly drive    if you drive it    miles an hour  under normal conditions      miles is a reasonable number. CA  Let's show that second video showing the Tesla in action on ice. Not at all a dig at The New York Times  this  by the way. What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car  EM  In creating an electric car  the responsiveness of the car is really incredible. So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car  so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one  and as you corner and accelerate  it just happens  like the car has ESP. You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness. You can't do that with a gasoline car. I think that's really a profound difference  and people only experience that when they have a test drive. CA  I mean  this is a beautiful but expensive car. Is there a road map where this becomes a mass market vehicle  EM  Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process  where version one was an expensive car at low volume  version two is medium priced and medium volume  and then version three would be low price  high volume. So we're at step two at this point. So we had a          sports car  which was the Roadster. Then we've got the Model S  which starts at around        dollars. And our third generation car  which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a         car. But whenever you've got really new technology  it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass market product. And so I think we're making progress in that direction  and I feel confident that we'll get there. CA  I mean  right now  if you've got a short commute  you can drive  you can get back  you can charge it at home. There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast. Do you see that coming  really  truly  or just on a few key routes  EM  There actually are far more charging stations than people realize  and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology  and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free  forever. And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize. We actually have California and Nevada covered  and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. covered. By the end of this year  you'll be able to drive from L.A. to New York just using the Supercharger network  which charges at five times the rate of anything else. And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop  to stop time  of about six or seven. So if you drive for three hours  you want to stop for    or    minutes  because that's normally what people will stop for. So if you start a trip at   a.m.  by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat  hit the restroom  coffee  and keep going. CA  So your proposition to consumers is  for the full charge  it could take an hour. So it's common    don't expect to be out of here in    minutes. Wait for an hour  but the good news is  you're helping save the planet  and by the way  the electricity is free. You don't pay anything. EM  Actually  what we're expecting is for people to stop for about    to    minutes  not for an hour. It's actually better to drive for about maybe          miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going. That's the natural cadence of a trip. CA  All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow. You've been working on this solar company SolarCity. What's unusual about that  EM  Well  as I mentioned earlier  we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption  so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar. I mean  it's really indirect fusion  is what it is. We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun  and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization. What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar powered already. If the sun wasn't there  we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin  and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation. The whole ecosystem is solar powered. CA  But in a gallon of gasoline  you have  effectively  thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space  so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar  and to remotely compete with  for example  natural gas  fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here  EM  Well actually  I'm confident that solar will beat everything  hands down  including natural gas. EM  It must  actually. If it doesn't  we're in deep trouble. CA  But you're not selling solar panels to consumers. What are you doing  EM  No  we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system. Most people choose to lease. And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs  so once it's installed  it's just there. It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century. So therefore  the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low  and then get the cost of the financing low  because that interest    those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar. And we've made huge progress in that direction  and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas. CA  So your current proposition to consumers is  don't pay so much up front. EM  Zero.CA  Pay zero up front. We will install panels on your roof. You will then pay  how long is a typical lease  EM  Typical leases are    years  but the value proposition is  as you're sort of alluding to  quite straightforward. It's no money down  and your utility bill decreases. Pretty good deal. CA  So that seems like a win for the consumer. No risk  you'll pay less than you're paying now. For you  the dream here then is that    I mean  who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term  I mean  how do you  the company  benefit  EM  Well  essentially  SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say  a company or a bank. Google is one of our big partners here. And they have an expected return on that capital. With that capital  SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment  which is less than the utility bill. CA  But you yourself get a long term commercial benefit from that power. You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility. EM  Exactly. What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility. I think it's a good thing  because utilities have been this monopoly  and people haven't had any choice. So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly  because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines  but now it's on your roof. So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses. CA  And you really picture a future where a majority of power in America  within a decade or two  or within your lifetime  it goes solar  EM  I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power  and most likely a majority  and I predict it will be a plurality in less than    years. I made that bet with someone  CA  Definition of plurality is  EM  More from solar than any other source. CA  Ah. Who did you make the bet with  EM  With a friend who will remain nameless. CA  Just between us.  Laughter  EM  I made that bet  I think  two or three years ago  so in roughly    years  I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source. CA  All right  so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself  I guess  a kind of crazy bet. You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal. You decided to build a space company. Why on Earth would someone do that  EM  I got that question a lot  that's true. People would say   Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry   Obviously   He started with a large one   is the punchline. And so I tell people  well  I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one. And they'd look at me  like   Is he serious   CA  And strangely  you were. So what happened  EM  It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out. We came very close to failure  but we managed to get through that point in     . The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology  and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space faring civilization  which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket. CA  Would humanity become a space faring civilization  So that was a dream of yours  in a way  from a young age  You've dreamed of Mars and beyond  EM  I did build rockets when I was a kid  but I didn't think I'd be involved in this. It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one  And I really think there's a fundamental difference  if you sort of look into the future  between a humanity that is a space faring civilization  that's out there exploring the stars  on multiple planets  and I think that's really exciting  compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event. CA  So you've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by    percent  depending on how you calculate it. How on Earth have you done that  NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this  EM  Well  we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe  the engines  the electronics and the launch operation. There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk  but    CA  Not least because you could still get copied  right  You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me. EM  No  we don't patent.CA  You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent. EM  Since our primary competitors are national governments  the enforceability of patents is questionable. Laughter   Applause  CA  That's really  really interesting. But the big innovation is still ahead  and you're working on it now. Tell us about this. EM  Right  so the big innovation  CA  In fact  let's roll that video and you can talk us through it  what's happening here. EM  Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable. All rockets that fly today are fully expendable. The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket  but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time  and the parts that were reusable took a        person group nine months to refurbish for flight. So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight. Obviously that doesn't work very well for   CA  What just happened there  We just saw something land  EM  That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back  to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours. CA  Wow. Reusable rockets.EM  Yes.  Applause  And so what a lot of people don't realize is  the cost of the fuel  of the propellant  is very small. It's much like on a jet. So the cost of the propellant is about .  percent of the cost of the rocket. So it's possible to achieve  let's say  roughly     fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket. That's why it's so important. Every mode of transport that we use  whether it's planes  trains  automobiles  bikes  horses  is reusable  but not rockets. So we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization. CA  You asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM  Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic. CA  Definitely more expensive. So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology  and  I guess  paves the way for your dream to actually take  at some point  to take humanity to Mars at scale. You'd like to see a colony on Mars. EM  Yeah  exactly. SpaceX  or some combination of companies and governments  needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary  of establishing a base on another planet  on Mars    being the only realistic option    and then building that base up until we're a true multi planet species. CA  So progress on this  let's make it reusable   how is that going  That was just a simulation video we saw. How's it going  EM  We're actually  we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project  where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight  the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky. And we've had some good tests. CA  Can we see that EM  Yeah. So that's just to give a sense of scale. We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket.  Laughter  CA  All right  let's see that video then  because this is actually amazing when you think about it. You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then    EM  Yeah  so that rocket is about the size of a    story building. So now it's hovering at about    meters  and it's constantly adjusting the angle  the pitch  and yaw of the main engine  and maintaining roll  with cold gas thrusters. CA  How cool is that   Applause  Elon  how have you done this  These projects are so    Paypal  SolarCity  Tesla  SpaceX  they're so spectacularly different  they're such ambitious projects at scale. How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way  What is it about you  EM  I don't know  actually. I don't have a good answer for you. I work a lot. I mean  a lot. CA  Well  I have a theory.EM  Okay. All right. CA  My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design  technology and business  so if TED was TBD  design  technology and business  into one package  synthesize it in a way that very few people can and    and this is the critical thing    feel so damn confident in that clicked together package that you take crazy risks. You bet your fortune on it  and you seem to have done that multiple times. I mean  almost no one can do that. Is that    could we have some of that secret sauce  Can we put it into our education system  Can someone learn from you  It is truly amazing what you've done. EM  Well  thanks. Thank you. Well  I do think there's a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know  the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are    what I mean by that is  boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there  as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life  we get through life by reasoning by analogy  which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise  mentally  you wouldn't be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new  you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive  like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive. So I think that's an important thing to do  and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback  and solicit it  particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice  but hardly anyone does that  and it's incredibly helpful. CA  Boys and girls watching  study physics. Learn from this man. Elon Musk  I wish we had all day  but thank you so much for coming to TED. EM  Thank you. CA  That was awesome. That was really  really cool. Look at that.  Applause  Just take a bow. That was fantastic. Thank you so much. When I was little  I thought my country was the best on the planet. And I grew up singing a song called  Nothing To Envy.  And I was very proud. In school  we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il Sung  but we never learned much about the outside world  except that America  South Korea  Japan are the enemies. Although I often wondered about the outside world  I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea  until everything suddenly changed. When I was seven years old  I saw my first public execution. But I thought my life in North Korea was normal. My family was not poor  and myself  I had never experienced hunger. But one day  in       my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. It read   When you read this  our five family members will not exist in this world  because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks. We are lying on the floor together  and our bodies are so weak  we are waiting to die.  I was so shocked. This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. Soon after  when I was walking past a train station  I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory. A lifeless woman was lying on the ground  while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. But nobody helped them  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid     s. Ultimately  more than a million North Koreans died during the famine  and many only survived by eating grass  bugs and tree bark. Power outages also became more and more frequent  so everything around me was completely dark at night  except for the sea of lights in China  just across the river from my home. I always wondered why they had lights  but we didn't. This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night  compared to neighbors. This is the Amnok River  which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. As you can see  the river can be very narrow at certain points  allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. But many die. Sometimes  I saw dead bodies floating down the river. I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea  but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine  I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. I could have never imagined that it would take    years to live together. In China  it was hard living as a young girl without my family. I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult  it's also very dangerous  since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed  and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate  back in North Korea. One day  my worst nightmare came true  when I was caught by the Chinese police  and brought to the police station for interrogation. Someone had accused me of being North Korean  so they tested my Chinese language abilities  and asked me tons of questions. I was so scared. I thought my heart was going to explode. If anything seemed unnatural  I could be imprisoned and repatriated. I thought my life was over. But I managed to control all the emotions inside me  and answer the questions. After they finished questioning me  one official said to another   This was a false report. She's not North Korean.  And they let me go. It was a miracle. Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies. But many can be caught by the Chinese police  and repatriated. These girls were so lucky. Even though they were caught  they were eventually released  after heavy international pressure. These North Koreans were not so lucky. Every year  countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea  where they can be tortured  imprisoned  or publicly executed. Even though I was really fortunate to get out  many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. Even after learning a new language and getting a job  their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. That's why  after    years of hiding my identity  I decided to risk going to South Korea. And I started a new life yet again. Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. English was so important in South Korea  so I had to start learning my third language. Also  I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. We are all Korean  but inside  we have become very different  due to    years of division. I even went through an identity crisis. Am I South Korean or North Korean  Where am I from  Who am I  Suddenly  there was no country I could proudly call my own. Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy  I made a plan    I started studying for the university entrance exam. Just as I was starting to get used to my new life  I received a shocking phone call. The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family  and  as a punishment  my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. They had to get out quickly. So I started planning how to help them escape. North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea. So  ironically  I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border. Since my family couldn't speak Chinese  I had to guide them somehow through more than       miles in China  and then into Southeast Asia. The journey by bus took one week  and we were almost caught several times. One time  our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. He took everyone's I.D. cards  and he started asking them questions. Since my family couldn't understand Chinese  I thought my family was going to be arrested. As the Chinese officer approached my family  I impulsively stood up  and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. He looked at me suspiciously  but luckily  he believed me. We made it all the way to the border of Laos. But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. But even after we got past the border  my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. After I paid the fine and bribe  my family was released in one month. But soon after  my family was arrested and jailed again  in the capital of Laos. This was one of the lowest points in my life. I did everything to get my family to freedom  and we came so close  but my family was thrown in jail  just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station  desperately trying to get my family out. but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. I lost all hope. At that moment  I heard one man's voice ask me   What's wrong   I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. In my broken English  and with a dictionary  I explained the situation  and without hesitating  the man went to the ATM  and he paid the rest of the money for my family  and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. I thanked him with all my heart  and I asked him   Why are you helping me    I'm not helping you   he said.  I'm helping the North Korean people.  I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people  when we needed it most. And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. Eventually  after our long journey  my family and I were reunited in South Korea. But getting to freedom is only half the battle. Many North Koreans are separated from their families  and when they arrive in a new country  they start with little or no money. So we can benefit from the international community for education  English language training  job training  and more. We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world. Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside  and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. I've been so lucky  received so much help and inspiration in my life  so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world  including the TED stage. Thank you. So let me ask for a show of hands. How many people here are over the age of     Well  there do seem to be a few. Well  congratulations  because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy  you are now in excess of the average life span of somebody who was born in     . But look what happened in the course of that century. If you follow that curve  you'll see that it starts way down there. There's that dip there for the      flu. And here we are at       average life expectancy of a child born today  age     and we are not done yet. Now  that's the good news. But there's still a lot of work to do. So  for instance  if you ask  how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis  Turns out it's about        which is pretty amazing  because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while. It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned  but how many of those       diseases now have treatments available  Only about    . So we have this huge challenge  this huge gap. You would think this wouldn't be too hard  that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we've learned about basic science and its application  a bridge that would look maybe something like this  where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other. Well  wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy  Unfortunately  it's not. In reality  trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this. There are no shiny bridges. You sort of place your bets. Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way  and the rains come and the lightning flashes  and oh my gosh  there are sharks in the water and the swimmer gets into trouble  and  uh oh  the swimmer drowned and the sailboat capsized  and that tugboat  well  it hit the rocks  and maybe if you're lucky  somebody gets across. Well  what does this really look like  Well  what is it to make a therapeutic  anyway  What's a drug  A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen  carbon  oxygen  nitrogen  and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape  and it's those shapes that determine whether  in fact  that particular drug is going to hit its target. Is it going to land where it's supposed to  So look at this picture here    a lot of shapes dancing around for you. Now what you need to do  if you're trying to develop a new treatment for autism or Alzheimer's disease or cancer is to find the right shape in that mix that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe. And when you look at what happens to that pipeline  you start out maybe with thousands  tens of thousands of compounds. You weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail. Ultimately  maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these  and if all goes well     years after you started  you will get one approval. And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success. So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would  and say   How can we do better   And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning. How can we make this go faster  How can we make it more successful  Well  let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked. One that has just happened in the last few months is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis. But it's taken a long time to get there. Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in      by my group working with another group in Toronto  discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene on chromosome  . That picture you see there  Here it is. That's the same kid. That's Danny Bessette     years later  because this is the year  and it's also the year where Danny got married  where we have  for the first time  the approval by the FDA of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding. That's the good news. The bad news is  this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis  and it won't work for Danny  and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him. But it took    years to get this far. That's too long. How do we go faster  Well  one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology  and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome  the ability to be able to look at a chromosome  to unzip it  to pull out all the DNA  and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code  the A's  C's  G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things  and the cost of doing this  which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars  has in the course of the last    years fallen faster than Moore's Law  down to the point where it is less than        dollars today to have your genome sequenced  or mine  and we're headed for the        genome fairly soon. Well  that's exciting. How does that play out in terms of application to a disease  I want to tell you about another disorder. This one is a disorder which is quite rare. It's called Hutchinson Gilford progeria  and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging. Only about one in every four million kids has this disease  and in a simple way  what happens is  because of a mutation in a particular gene  a protein is made that's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate. Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell. The normal cell  if you looked at it under the microscope  would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell  which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that. A progeria cell  on the other hand  because of this toxic protein called progerin  has these lumps and bumps in it. So what we would like to do after discovering this back in      is to come up with a way to try to correct that. Well again  by knowing something about the molecular pathways  it was possible to pick one of those many  many compounds that might have been useful and try it out. In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon  if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria  and you watch to see what happened  in just    hours  that cell becomes  for all purposes that we can determine  almost like a normal cell. Well that was exciting  but would it actually work in a real human being  This has led  in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial  to a test of that very compound. And the kids that you see here all volunteered to be part of this     of them  and you can see as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease  all looking quite similar to each other. And instead of telling you more about it  I'm going to invite one of them  Sam Berns from Boston  who's here this morning  to come up on the stage and tell us about his experience as a child affected with progeria. Sam is    years old. His parents  Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon  both physicians  are here with us this morning as well. Sam  please have a seat. So Sam  why don't you tell these folks what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria  Sam Burns  Well  progeria limits me in some ways. I cannot play sports or do physical activities  but I have been able to take interest in things that progeria  luckily  does not limit. But when there is something that I really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of  like marching band or umpiring  we always find a way to do it  and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life. Francis Collins  So what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this  What would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well  SB  Well  research on progeria has come so far in less than    years  and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far  and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria  and it shows that if that drive exists  anybody can cure any disease  and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future  and so we can eliminate those       diseases that Francis was talking about. FC  Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today to be here  and he is    Applause     He is  by the way  a straight A  student in the ninth grade in his school in Boston. Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam. SB  Thank you very much. FC  Well done. Well done  buddy. So I just want to say a couple more things about that particular story  and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases  as Sam says  these       that are waiting for answers. You might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that. It's such a rare disease  it would be hard for a company to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug. This is a drug that was developed for cancer. Turned out  it didn't work very well for cancer  but it has exactly the right properties  the right shape  to work for progeria  and that's what's happened. Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically  Could we  in fact  encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for  Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways    some of those could be repositioned or repurposed  or whatever word you want to use  for new applications  basically teaching old drugs new tricks. That could be a phenomenal  valuable activity. We have many discussions now between NIH and companies about doing this that are looking very promising. And you could expect quite a lot to come from this. There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances. The first drug for HIV AIDS was not developed for HIV AIDS. It was developed for cancer. It was AZT. It didn't work very well for cancer  but became the first successful antiretroviral  and you can see from the table there are others as well. So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort  Well  we have to come up with a partnership between academia  government  the private sector  and patient organizations to make that so. At NIH  we have started this new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It just started last December  and this is one of its goals. Let me tell you another thing we could do. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it's effective and safe without having to put patients at risk  because that first time you're never quite sure  How do we know  for instance  whether drugs are safe before we give them to people  We test them on animals. And it's not all that reliable  and it's costly  and it's time consuming. Suppose we could do this instead on human cells. You probably know  if you've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us. So what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe  Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip. This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston  and what they have done here  if we can run the little video  is to take cells from an individual  turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung  and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe. You can see this chip even breathes. It has an air channel. It has a blood channel. And it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound. Are those cells happy or not  You can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys  for hearts  for muscles  all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem  for the liver. And ultimately  because you can do this for the individual  we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines will be you on a chip  what we're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety. So let me sum up. We are in a remarkable moment here. For me  at NIH now for almost    years  there has never been a time where there was more excitement about the potential that lies in front of us. We have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world. What do we need to capitalize on this  First of all  we need resources. This is research that's high risk  sometimes high cost. The payoff is enormous  both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that. Second  we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations  just like the one I've been describing here  in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds. And third  and maybe most important  we need talent. We need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort    all ages  all different groups    because this is the time  folks. This is the   st century biology that you've been waiting for  and we have the chance to take that and turn it into something which will  in fact  knock out disease. That's my goal. I hope that's your goal. I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we're trying to do here and why it matters. It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible. If you don't believe me  just ask Sam. Thank you all very much. In      I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life. I was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree. I took a couple victory laps in there. And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California  and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus  and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains. And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise  and as we sat there  over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us  and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley  so help me God  every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time. And then the clouds came over us  and then  boom  This massive thunderclap  and sheets of rain. It was just extraordinary  and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz  and decided to set it to music  a piece for choir called  Cloudburst   which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment. Now fast forward to just three years ago. the Virtual Choir Project      singers from    different countries. You can see my little video there conducting these people  alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home. Two years ago  on this very stage  we premiered Virtual Choir          singers from    different countries  this time performing a piece that I had written called  Sleep.  And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir     Water Night   another piece that I had written  this time nearly       singers from    different countries. And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this  he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could. Could we do this all in real time  Could we have people singing together in real time  And with the help of Skype  that is what we are going to attempt today. Now  we'll perform  Cloudburst  for you. The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage. I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach  Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College  some of the best amateur choirs in the country  and   and in the second half of the piece  the virtual choir will join us     different singers from    different countries. Now  we've pushed the technology as far as it can go  but there's still less than a second of latency  but in musical terms  that's a lifetime. We deal in milliseconds. So what I've done is  I've adapted  Cloudburst  so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together. So with deep humility  and for your approval  we present  Cloudburst.   The rain ...   Eyes of shadow water   eyes of well water   eyes of dream water.   Blue suns  green whirlwinds    birdbeaks of light pecking open   pomegranate stars.   But tell me  burnt earth  is there no water    Only blood  only dust    only naked footsteps on the thorns    The rain awakens...   We must sleep with open eyes    we must dream with our hands    we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course    of the sun dreaming its worlds.   We must dream aloud    we must sing till the song puts forth roots    trunk  branches  birds  stars.   We must find the lost word    and remember what the blood    the tides  the earth  and the body say    and return to the point of departure...    Cloudburst  Octavio Paz  translation by Lysander Kemp  adapted by Eric Whitacre  Eric Whitacre  Beth. Annabelle  where are you  Jacob. Thank you. Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms  bacteria  viruses and fungi. Our desks  our computers  our pencils  our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes. As we design these things  we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds  and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems. Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes  and these creatures define who we are. The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods. The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system. The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath  or not  and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch. So  for example  when you touch a pencil  microbial exchange happens. If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings  this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways. I get asked all of the time from people   Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems   And I believe the answer is yes. I think we're doing it right now  but we're doing it unconsciously. I'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how  through both conscious and unconscious design  we're impacting these invisible worlds. This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon  and I worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over     rooms in this building. We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building  and to do this  we sampled dust. From the dust  we pulled out bacterial cells  broke them open  and compared their gene sequences. This means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project. This is a picture of Tim  who  right when I snapped this picture  reminded me  he said   Jessica  the last lab group I worked in I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest  and things have changed dramatically for me.  So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices  and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk. The way that you look at this data is  first  look around the outside of the circle. You'll see broad bacterial groups  and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe  it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group. So at    o'clock  you'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria  and at one o'clock you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare. Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building. If you look inside the restrooms  they all have really similar ecosystems  and if you were to look inside the classrooms  those also have similar ecosystems. But if you look across these space types  you can see that they're fundamentally different from one another. I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest. I told Tim   If you could just see the microbes  it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of.  And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland. This perspective is a really powerful one for designers  because you can bring on principles of ecology  and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal  the way organisms move around. We know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air. So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system. Mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable  that the air flow and temperature is just right. They do this using principles of physics and chemistry  but they could also be using biology. If you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building  you'll see that they're all very similar to one another. And if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit  you'll see that they're fundamentally different. The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago  and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers  and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to. Another facet of how microbes get around is by people  and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people  or the sharing of ideas  like in labs and in offices. Given that microbes travel around with people  you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes. And that is exactly what we found. If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another  they have very similar ecosystems  but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away  the ecosystem is fundamentally different. And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns  it makes me think that it's possible to tackle really challenging problems  like hospital acquired infections. I believe this has got to be  in part  a building ecology problem. All right  I'm going to tell you one more story about this building. I am collaborating with Charlie Brown. He's an architect  and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change. He's dedicated his life to sustainable design. When he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building  he got really excited  because it added a new dimension to what he did. He went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health. He helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated. So what I'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building. What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air  and how they vary over time. Next I'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms. We blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation. A lot of buildings are operated this way  probably where you work  and companies do this to save money on their energy bill. What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until Saturday  when we opened the vents up again. When you walked into those rooms  they smelled really bad  and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before. Contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers. In these rooms  the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well  and when Charlie saw this  he got really excited. He felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape. The examples that I just gave you are about architecture  but they're relevant to the design of anything. Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone. There's a new microbe  I just discovered it. It's called BLIS  and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath. Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones  A conscious approach to design  I'm calling it bioinformed design  and I think it's possible. Thank you. I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at. You're about to experience a new  available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives. What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material. It's called Ultra Ever Dry  and when you apply it to any material  it turns into a superhydrophobic shield. So this is a cinder block  uncoated  and you can see that it's porous  it absorbs water. Not anymore. Porous  nonporous. So what's superhydrophobic  Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface. The rounder it is  the more hydrophobic it is  and if it's really round  it's superhydrophobic. A freshly waxed car  the water molecules slump to about    degrees. A windshield coating is going to give you about     degrees. But what you're seeing here is     to     degrees  and anything over     is superhydrophobic. So as part of the demonstration  what I have is a pair of gloves  and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating  and let's see if you can tell which one  and I'll give you a hint. Did you guess the one that was dry  When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience  what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits. And we're talking really small here. The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers  and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter  and to put some scale to that  if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick  and you put it side by side  and you had        of them  you'd be the width of a human hair. So very small  but very useful. And it's not just water that this works with. It's a lot of water based materials like concrete  water based paint  mud  and also some refined oils as well. You can see the difference. Moving onto the next demonstration  we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it  we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating  and we're going to pour this green tinted water inside the middle  and you're going to see  it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would  except when it hits the coating  it stops  and I can't even coax it to leave. It's that afraid of the water. So what's going on here  What's happening  Well  the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface. You'd think it'd be smooth  but it's actually not. And it has billions of interstitial spaces  and those spaces  along with the nanoparticles  reach up and grab the air molecules  and cover the surface with air. It's an umbrella of air all across it  and that layer of air is what the water hits  the mud hits  the concrete hits  and it glides right off. So if I put this inside this water here  you can see a silver reflective coating around it  and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle  and it's dry. So what are the applications  I mean  many of you right now are probably going through your head. Everyone that sees this gets excited  and says   Oh  I could use it for this and this and this.  The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti wetting. We've certainly seen that today. It could be anything that's anti icing  because if you don't have water  you don't have ice. It could be anti corrosion. No water  no corrosion. It could be anti bacterial. Without water  the bacteria won't survive. And it could be things that need to be self cleaning as well. So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work. And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration  but before I do that  I would like to say thank you  and think small. It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it. Chris Anderson  You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED   Laughter   Two minutes later...  He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part. It's happening  This is where I live. I live in Kenya  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. Those are my dad's cows at the back  and behind the cows  that's the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely  which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. So predators like lions follow them  and this is what they do. They kill our livestock. This is one of the cows which was killed at night  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead  and I felt so bad  because it was the only bull we had. My community  the Maasai  we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them  and that's why we value them so much. So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock  and they're also upset about this problem. So they kill the lions. It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. So a boy  from six to nine years old  in my community is responsible for his dad's cows  and that's the same thing which happened to me. So I had to find a way of solving this problem. And the first idea I got was to use fire  because I thought lions were scared of fire. But I came to realize that that didn't really help  because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. So I didn't give up. I continued. And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. I was trying to trick the lions  into thinking  that I was standing near the cowshed. But lions are very clever.  Laughter  They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow  and they go back  but the second day  they'll come and they say  this thing is not moving here  it's always here.  Laughter  So he jumps in and kills the animals. So one night  I was walking around the cowshed with a torch  and that day  the lions didn't come. And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. So I had an idea. Since I was a small boy  I used to work in my room for the whole day  and I even took apart my mom's new radio  and that day she almost killed me  but I learned a lot about electronics.  Laughter  So I got an old car battery  an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights  on and off. And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. So I set up everything. As you can see  the solar panel charges the battery  and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. And the indicator box makes the lights flash. As you can see  the bulbs face outside  because that's where the lions come from. And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed  but I was sleeping in my bed. Thanks. So I set it up in my home two years ago  and since then  we have never experienced any problem with lions. And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. One of them was this grandmother. She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions  and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. And I said   Yes.  So I put the lights. You can see at the back  those are the lion lights. Since now  I've set up seven homes around my community  and they're really working. And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas  leopards  and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. Because of this invention  I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya  Brookhouse International School  and I'm really excited about this. My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. I even took my friends back to my community  and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have  any   and I'm teaching them how to put them. So one year ago  I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows  and I used to see planes flying over  and I told myself that one day  I'll be there inside. And here I am today. I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. I used to hate lions  but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions  we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. Ash  ol n. It means in my language  thank you very much. Chris Anderson  You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere  Yep. CA  You're working on other electrical inventions. What's the next one on your list  RT  My next invention is  I want to make an electric fence.CA  Electric fence  RT  But I know electric fences are already invented  but I want to make mine. CA  You already tried it once  right  and you   RT  I tried it before  but I stopped because it gave me a shock.  Laughter  CA  In the trenches. Richard Turere  you are something else. We're going to cheer you on every step of the way  my friend. Thank you so much.RT  Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain. We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line. So game theory is a branch of  originally  applied mathematics  used mostly in economics and political science  a little bit in biology  that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else. That's a lot of things  competition  cooperation  bargaining  games like hide and seek  and poker. Here's a simple game to get us started. Everyone chooses a number from zero to      we're going to compute the average of those numbers  and whoever's closest to two thirds of the average wins a fixed prize. So you want to be a little bit below the average number  but not too far below  and everyone else wants to be a little bit below the average number as well. Think about what you might pick. As you're thinking  this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right  You don't want to sell too early  because you miss out on profits  but you don't want to wait too late to when everyone else sells  triggering a crash. You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition  but not too far ahead. Okay  here's two theories about how people might think about this  and then we'll see some data. Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see. A lot of people say   I really don't know what people are going to pick  so I think the average will be   .  They're not being really strategic at all.  And I'll pick two thirds of   . That's   .  That's a start. Other people who are a little more sophisticated  using more working memory  say   I think people will pick    because they're going to pick a response to     and so I'll pick     which is two thirds of   .  They're doing one extra step of thinking  two steps. That's better. And of course  in principle  you could do three  four or more  but it starts to get very difficult. Just like in language and other domains  we know that it's hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure. This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory  by the way. It's something that I've worked on and a few other people  and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected by lots of interesting variables and variant people  as we'll see in a minute. A very different theory  a much more popular one  and an older one  due largely to John Nash of  A Beautiful Mind  fame  is what's called equilibrium analysis. So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level  you will have learned a little bit about this. An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do. It is a very useful concept  but behaviorally  it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world. In this case  the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction  which is everyone wants to be below everyone else  therefore they'll play zero. Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many  many times. Some of the earliest ones were done in the '  s by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others. This is a beautiful data set of       people who wrote in to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest. The contest said  send in your numbers and whoever is close to two thirds of the average will win a big prize. And as you can see  there's so much data here  you can see the spikes very visibly. There's a spike at   . Those are people doing one step. There is another spike visible at   . And notice  by the way  that most people pick numbers right around there. They don't necessarily pick exactly    and   . There's something a little bit noisy around it. But you can see those spikes  and they're there. There's another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis  because they're picking zero or one. But they lose  right  Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well. So they're smart  but poor. Where are these things happening in the brain  One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp  interesting answer. So they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fMRI  and two conditions  in some trials  they're told you're playing another person who's playing right now and we're going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win. In the other trials  they're told  you're playing a computer. They're just choosing randomly. So what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there's more brain activity when you're playing people compared to playing the computer. And you see activity in some regions we've seen today  medial prefrontal cortex  dorsomedial  however  up here  ventromedial prefrontal cortex  anterior cingulate  an area that's involved in lots of types of conflict resolution  like if you're playing  Simon Says   and also the right and left temporoparietal junction. And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known to be part of what's called a  theory of mind  circuit  or  mentalizing circuit.  That is  it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do. So these were some of the first studies to see this tied in to game theory. What happens with these one  and two step types  So we classify people by what they picked  and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers  which brain areas are differentially active. On the top you see the one step players. There's almost no difference. The reason is  they're treating other people like a computer  and the brain is too. The bottom players  you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC. So we know that those two step players are doing something differently. Now if you were to step back and say   What can we do with this information   you might be able to look at brain activity and say   This person's going to be a good poker player   or   This person's socially naive   and we might also be able to study things like development of adolescent brains once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists. Okay. Get ready. I'm saving you some brain activity  because you don't need to use your hair detector cells. You should use those cells to think carefully about this game. This is a bargaining game. Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes are going to bargain over one to six dollars. If they can do it in    seconds  they're going to actually earn that money. If    seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal  they get nothing. That's kind of a mistake together. The twist is that one player  on the left  is informed about how much on each trial there is. They play lots of trials with different amounts each time. In this case  they know there's four dollars. The uninformed player doesn't know  but they know that the informed player knows. So the uninformed player's challenge is to say   Is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split   in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal. So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money but trying to goad the other player into giving you more. And the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars  and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets  and the informed player's going to get the rest. So this is like a management labor negotiation in which the workers don't know how much profits the privately held company has  right  and they want to maybe hold out for more money  but the company might want to create the impression that there's very little to split   I'm giving you the most that I can.  First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs  they play face to face. We have some other data where they play across computers. That's an interesting difference  as you might imagine. But a bunch of the face to face pairs agree to divide the money evenly every single time. Boring. It's just not interesting neurally. It's good for them. They make a lot of money. But we're interested in  can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don't occur  So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree. So they have a chance of    they bicker and disagree and end up with less money. They might be eligible to be on  Real Housewives   the TV show. You see on the left  when the amount to divide is one  two or three dollars  they disagree about half the time  and when the amount is four  five  six  they agree quite often. This turns out to be something that's predicted by a very complicated type of game theory you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about. It's a little too complicated to explain right now  but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur. Your intuition might tell you that too. Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording. Very complicated. The right brain schematic is the uninformed person  and the left is the informed. Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time  so we can ask about time synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously  just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you'd expect common activity in language regions when they're actually kind of listening and communicating. So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time  and the direction of the arrows flows from the region that's active first in time  and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later. So in this case  if you look carefully  most of the arrows flow from right to left. That is  it looks as if the uninformed brain activity is happening first  and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain. And by the way  these were trials where their deals were made. This is from the first two seconds. We haven't finished analyzing this data  so we're still peeking in  but the hope is that we can say something in the first couple of seconds about whether they'll make a deal or not  which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation and ugly divorces and things like that. Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost by delay and strikes. Here's the case where the disagreements occur. You can see it looks different than the one before. There's a lot more arrows. That means that the brains are synced up more closely in terms of simultaneous activity  and the arrows flow clearly from left to right. That is  the informed brain seems to be deciding   We're probably not going to make a deal here.  And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain. Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives. They're hairy  smelly  fast and strong. You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving. Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you. Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago. They're still our closest genetic kin. We share   .  percent of the genes. We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses. And we're also their closest cousin. They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas. So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently might tell us a lot about brain evolution. So this is an amazing memory test from Nagoya  Japan  Primate Research Institute  where they've done a lot of this research. This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory. The chimp is going to see  watch carefully  they're going to see     milliseconds' exposure   that's fast  that's eight movie frames   of numbers one  two  three  four  five. Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares  and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward. Let's see how they can do it. This is a young chimp. The young ones are better than the old ones  just like humans. And they're highly experienced  so they've done this thousands and thousands of time. Obviously there's a big training effect  as you can imagine. You can see they're very blas  and kind of effortless. Not only can they do it very well  they do it in a sort of lazy way. Right  Who thinks you could beat the chimps  Wrong.  Laughter  We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try. Okay  so the next part of this study I'm going to go quickly through is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa. He had a bold idea that    what he called the cognitive trade off hypothesis. We know chimps are faster and stronger. They're also very obsessed with status. His thought was  maybe they've preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really  really important to them to negotiate status and to win  which is something like strategic thinking during competition. So we're going to check that out by having the chimps actually play a game by touching two touch screens. The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers. They're going to press left or right. One chimp is called a matcher. They win if they press left  left  like a seeker finding someone in hide and seek  or right  right. The mismatcher wants to mismatch. They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp. And the rewards are apple cube rewards. So here's how game theorists look at these data. This is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x axis  and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the y axis. So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players  one trying to match  one trying to mismatch. The NE square in the middle    actually NE  CH and QRE    those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium  and others  tells you what the theory predicts  which is that they should match        because if you play left too much  for example  I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right. And as you can see  the chimps  each chimp is one triangle  are circled around  hovering around that prediction. Now we move the payoffs. We're actually going to make the left  left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher. Now they get three apple cubes. Game theoretically  that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift  because what happens is  the mismatcher will think  oh  this guy's going to go for the big reward  and so I'm going to go to the right  make sure he doesn't get it. And as you can see  their behavior moves up in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium. Finally  we changed the payoffs one more time. Now it's four apple cubes  and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium. It's sprinkled around  but if you average the chimps out  they're really  really close  within .  . They're actually closer than any species we've observed. What about humans  You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee  Here's two human groups in green and blue. They're closer to      . They're not responding to payoffs as closely  and also if you study their learning in the game  they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards. The chimps are playing better than the humans  better in the sense of adhering to game theory. And these are two different groups of humans from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely. None of them are close to where the chimps are. So here are some things we learned today. People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking using theory of mind. We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money  and chimps are better competitors than humans  as judged by game theory. Thank you.
