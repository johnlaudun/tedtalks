I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved. I'd like to start with a little experiment. Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses  or you've had laser refractive surgery  Now  unfortunately  there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly. But it looks like    I'm guessing    that it'll be about    percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction. The World Health Organization estimates    well  they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses    the lowest estimate is     million people. They also have an estimate of around a billion. But in fact  I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now  which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population. And the problem of poor vision  is actually not just a health problem  it's also an educational problem  and it's an economic problem  and it's a quality of life problem. Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful. The problem is  there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world. There are just way too few eye care professionals. So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about        people and that's the ratio in the U.K. This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub Saharan Africa. In fact  there are some countries in sub Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. How do you do this  How do you solve this problem  I came up with a solution to this problem  and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this. And the idea is you make eye glasses  and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem. What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses. I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket. I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end  I can hardly see them. So    okay  I can now see that man running out there  and I can see that guy running out there. I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription. Next step in my process. So  I've now made eye glasses to my prescription. Okay  so I've made these glasses and ... Okay  I've made the glasses to my prescription and ... ... I've just ... And I've now made some glasses. That's it. Now  these aren't the only pair in the world. In fact  this technology's been evolving. I started working on it in       and it's been evolving very slowly. There are about        in use now. And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. And I have a vision  which I'll share with you. I have a global vision for vision. And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year     . To do that    this is an early example of the technology. The technology is being further developed    the cost has to be brought down. This pair  in fact  these currently cost about    dollars. But the cost has to be brought right down. It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day. How do you solve this problem  You start to get into detail. And on this slide  I'm basically explaining all the problems you have. How do you distribute  How do you work out how to fit the thing  How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem  How do you deal with the industry  And the answer to that is research. What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university. If you want to know more  just come have a look at our website. Thank you. It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment when the finance  the credit  which drives our economies froze. A massive cardiac arrest. The effect  the payback  perhaps  for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff  whom we saw earlier. Abuse of steroids  binging and so on. And it's only a few months since governments injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat. And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone  where no one quite knows what's worked  or what doesn't. We don't have any very clear maps  any compass to guide us. We don't know which experts to believe anymore. What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis  what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis. There's a definition of leadership which says   It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect.  And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis  which is by no means small  really is used to the full. I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from. I've got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times. I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms  as you can see. I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy. I've been a civil servant  and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well. But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city  this university  as a student. And then as now  it was a beautiful place of balls and punts  beautiful people  many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment that   even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm  why risk it   But when I was here  a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation  leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment  and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities. And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts. And they were people who were not short of wit  or grace or energy  but they had no hope  no jobs  no prospects. And when people aren't allowed to be useful  they soon think that they're useless. And although that was great for the music business at the time  it wasn't much good for anything else. And ever since then  I've wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things  but so inefficient at others  why it's so innovative in some ways and so un innovative in others. Now  since that time  we've actually been through an extraordinary boom  the longest boom ever in the history of this country. Unprecedented wealth and prosperity  but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed. H.L. Mencken once said that   to every complex problem  there is a simple solution and it's wrong.  But I'm not saying growth is wrong  but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth  many things didn't get better. Rates of depression carried on up  right across the Western world. If you look at America  the proportion of Americans with no one to talk to about important things went up from a tenth to a quarter. We commuted longer to work  but as you can see from this graph  the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be. And it became ever clearer that economic growth doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth. We're now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market. There will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year  thousands losing their jobs everyday in America. We've got to do whatever we can to help them  but we've also got to ask  I think  a more profound question of whether we use this crisis to jump forward to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs  to a better balance of economy and society. And I think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity. They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream. They often lead to the acceleration of much needed reforms. And you saw that in the '  s  when the Great Depression paved the way for Bretton Woods  welfare states and so on. And I think you can see around us now  some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow. You can see it in daily life. When times are hard  people have to do things for themselves  and right across the world  Oxford  Omaha  Omsk  you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming  people taking over land  taking over roofs  turning barges into temporary farms. And I'm a very small part of this. I have        of these things in my garden. A few of these. This is Atilla the hen. And I'm a very small part of a very large movement  which for some people is about survival  but is also about values  about a different kind of economy  which isn't so much about consumption and credit  but about things which matter to us. And everywhere too  you can see a proliferation of time banks and parallel currencies  people using smart technologies to link up all the resources freed up by the market    people  buildings  land    and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs. There's a similar story  I think  for governments. Ronald Reagan  again  said the two funniest sentences in the English language are   I'm from the government. And I'm here to help.  But I think last year when governments did step in  people were quite glad that they were there  that they did act. But now  a few months on  however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face  as someone once put it  they can't hide their uncertainty. Because it's already clear how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy  really went into fixing the past  bailing out the banks  the car companies  not preparing us for the future. How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption  not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve. And everywhere  as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our children's money  now  in the depth of this crisis  they're asking  Surely  we should be using this with a longer term vision to accelerate the shift to a green economy  to prepare for aging  to deal with some of the inequalities which scar countries like this and the United States rather than just giving the money to the incumbents  Surely  we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs  to civil society  for people able to create the new  not to the big  well connected companies  big  clunky government programs. And  after all this  as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said   Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish. Don't overdo it.  And I think more and more people are also asking  Why boost consumption  rather than change what we consume  Like the mayor of S o Paulo who's banned advertising billboards  or the many cities like San Francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars. You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world. Some  I think some of the bankers who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. But ask yourselves  What will be the biggest sectors of the economy in            years time  It won't be the ones lining up for handouts  like cars and aerospace and so on. The biggest sector  by far  will be health    already    percent of the American economy  predicted to grow to     even    percent by mid century. Elder care  child care  already much bigger employers than cars. Education  six  seven  eight percent of the economy and growing. Environmental services  energy services  the myriad of green jobs  they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy which isn't just about products  but is using distributed networks  and it's founded above all on care  on relationships  on what people do to other people  often one to one  rather than simply selling them a product. And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society  the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is  in a way  a very simple one  but quite a difficult one. We know our societies have to radically change. We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis. But we also know it's only through experiment that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city  how to care for a much older population  how to deal with drug addiction and so on. And here's the problem. In science  we do experiments systematically. Our societies now spend two  three  four percent of GDP to invest systematically in new discovery  in science  in technology  to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions which illuminate gatherings like this. It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago  maybe they are  but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did. And what's striking though  is that in society there's almost nothing comparable  no comparable investment  no systematic experiment  in the things capitalism isn't very good at  like compassion  or empathy  or relationships or care. Now  I didn't really understand that until I met this guy who was then an    year old  slightly shambolic man who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated. He had helped shape Britain's post war institutions  its welfare state  its economy  but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur  became an inventor of many  many different organizations. Some famous ones like the Open University  which has         students  the University of the Third Age  which has nearly half a million older people teaching other older people  as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines and schools for social entrepreneurs. And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists. He believed if you see a problem  you shouldn't tell someone to act  you should act on it yourself  and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer. And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers  not from a theory  but from experiment  and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs  which were usually the people living with those needs. And he believed we live with others  we share the world with others and therefore our innovation must be done with others too  not doing things at people  for them  and so on. Now  what he did didn't used to have a name  but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream. It's what we do in the organization named after him where we try and invent  create  launch new ventures  whether it's schools  web companies  health organizations and so on. And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation  using ideas from design or technology or community organizing to develop the germs of a future world  but through practice and through demonstration and not through theory. And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA and across Europe. And they've been given new momentum by the crisis  by the need for better answers to joblessness  community breakdown and so on. Some of the ideas are strange. These are complaints choirs. People come together to sing about the things that really bug them. Others are much more pragmatic  health coaches  learning mentors  job clubs. And some are quite structural  like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital  and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are. Now  the idea that all of this represents  I think  is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of how we respond to the crisis  recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress. There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country  as well as a public service innovation lab. Across northern Europe  many governments now have innovation laboratories within them. And just a few months ago  President Obama launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House. And what people are beginning to ask is  Surely  just as we invest in R and D  two  three  four percent  of our GDP  of our economy  what if we put  let's say  one percent of public spending into social innovation  into elder care  new kinds of education  new ways of helping the disabled  Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society to those we've had in the economy and in technology. And if  a generation or two ago  the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon  perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition  stopping trafficking  or one  I think closer to home for America or Europe  why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens. Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade  but only with radical and systematic experiment  not just with technologies  but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too. Now  I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism. I think what this is all about  this whole movement which is growing from the margins  remains quite small. Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont. What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social. It's already immersed in social networks. It will become more involved in social investment  and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others  not just from what you sell to them  and from relationships as well as from consumption. But interestingly too  it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation into society  trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work. Now  I think this future will be quite surprising to many people. In recent years  a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won. History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy. But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy     years ago  just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. Then  people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature. We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy. Just as today  the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature  only now it's individualism  inquisitiveness  and so on. Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger  mass democracy  which was seen as a well intentioned but doomed experiment  just as capitalism has seen off socialism. Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism. And whereas then monarchies  palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident  today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city. I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost  though that might be quite tempting. But I do think we're on the verge of a period when  just as happened to the monarchy and  interestingly  the military too  the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end  and it's going to steadily move to the sides  the margins of our society  transformed from being a master into a servant  a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. And as that happens  we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism  which is that  unlike what you read in economics textbooks  it's not a self sufficient system. It depends on other systems  on ecology  on family  on community  and if these aren't replenished  capitalism suffers too. And our human nature isn't just selfish  it's also compassionate. It's not just competitive  it's also caring. Because of the depth of the crisis  I think we are at a moment of choice. The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us. It will be worse at the end of this year  quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today. But this is one of those very rare moments when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously to get back to where we were a year or two ago  and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for  or whether this is a moment to jump ahead  to reboot and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway. Thank you. I'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations. One of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature  and trying to find hidden data within nature. It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere  all around us. Everything gives out some kind of data  whether it's sound or smell or vibration. Through my work  I've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this. And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics. Now  cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water  as you can see there. So  if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance  by Da Vinci  Galileo  the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni. He created an experiment using a metal plate  covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. Moving on from this  the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the     s. He actually coined the term cymatics. Then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert  John Stewart Reed. He's kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment. What we can see here is the metal sheet  this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator. As the frequencies increase  so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate. As you can see with your own eyes. So  what excites me about cymatics  Well  for me cymatics is an almost magical tool. It's like a looking glass into a hidden world. Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics  we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen. Devices like the cymascope  which you can see here  have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns. And the list of scientific applications is growing every day. For example  in oceanography  a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit. And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate. We can also use cymatics for healing and education. This is an installation developed with school children  where their hands are tracked. It allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them. We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form. This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device. So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit. This is Pink Floyd's  Machine  playing in real time through the cymascope. We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature. And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature. So  for example  here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature. Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake. And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish. And there is thousands of these. So what does this all mean  Well  there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field. But consider for a moment that sound does have form. We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter. Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming. And think about the immense sound of the universe forming. And if we kind of ponder on that  then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. And here is some eye candy for you  from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe. Cymatics is accessible to everybody. I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion  your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics. I think collectively we can build a global community. We can inspire each other. And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen. Thank you. I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity to come and speak to you today about what I consider to be the biggest stunt on Earth. Or perhaps not quite on Earth. A parachute jump from the very edge of space. More about that a bit later on. What I'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television  and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. I've been a professional stunt man for    years. I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts I often design them. During that time  health and safety has become everything about my job. It's critical now that when a car crash happens it isn't just the stunt person we make safe  it's the crew. We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men. We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set  or any passerby. So  safety is everything. But it wasn't always that way. In the old days of the silent movies    Harold Lloyd here  hanging famously from the clock hands    a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable. They had no safety  no real technology. What safety they had was very scant. This is the first stunt woman  Rosie Venger  an amazing woman. You can see from the slide  very very strong. She really paved the way at a time when nobody was doing stunts  let alone women. My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt. Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight. He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch ups you see in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated. This is a screen capture from  Stagecoach   where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen. There is no safety  no back support  no pads  no crash mats  no sand pits in the ground. That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts  certainly. Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date  some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts. We couldn't do them without technology. These are particularly dangerous because there is no mask on my face. They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper  one for FHM magazine. Highly dangerous  but also you'll notice it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit. The fire suits of old  the bulky suits  the thick woolen suits  have been replaced with modern materials like Nomex or  more recently  Carbonex    fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals to burn for longer  look more spectacular  and in pure safety. Here's a bit more. There's a guy with a flame thrower there  giving me what for. One of the things that a stuntman often does  and you'll see it every time in the big movies  is be blown through the air. Well  we used to use trampettes. In the old days  that's all they had. And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air  and hopefully you make it look good. Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram. It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer  because it will break your legs very  very quickly if you land on it wrong. Having said that  it works with compressed nitrogen. And that's in the up position. When you step on it  either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot  it will fire you  depending on the gas pressure  anything from five feet to    feet. I could  quite literally  fire myself into the gallery. Which I'm sure you wouldn't want. Not today. Car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us  and safer. We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now. Being run over is never easy. That's an old fashioned  hard  gritty  physical stunt. But we have padding  and fantastic shock absorbing things like Sorbothane    the materials that help us  when we're hit like this  not to hurt ourselves too much. The picture in the bottom right hand corner there is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing. Showing how stunts work in different areas  really. And testing breakaway signpost pillars. A company makes a Lattix pillar  which is a network  a lattice type pillar that collapses when it's hit. The car on the left drove into the steel pillar. And you can't see it from there  but the engine was in the driver's lap. They did it by remote control. I drove the other one at    miles an hour  exactly the same speed  and clearly walked away from it. Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology. We used to have to drive up a ramp  and we still do sometimes. But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon. You can just see  underneath the car  there is a black rod on the floor by the wheel of the other car. That's the piston that was fired out of the floor. We can flip lorries  coaches  buses  anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power.  Laughs  It's a great job  really.  Laughter  It's such fun  You should hear some of the phone conversations that I have with people on my Bluetooth in the shop.  Well  we can flip the bus over  we can have it burst into flames  and how about someone  you know  big explosion.  And people are looking like this ... I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are. The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year with our Channel Five's  Fifth Gear Show.  A loop the loop  biggest in the world. Only one person had ever done it before. Now  the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be   Let's hit this as fast as possible.    miles an hour. Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor.  Well  you'd die if you did that. We went to Cambridge University  the other university  and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there  a physicist who taught us that it had to be    miles an hour. Even then  I caught seven G and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in. That's a long way to fall  if you get it wrong. That was just about right. So again  science helps us  and with the engineering too    the modifications to the car and the wheel. High falls  they're old fashioned stunts. What's interesting about high falls is that although we use airbags  and some airbags are quite advanced  they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to  if you land a bit wrong. So  they're a much safer proposition. Just basically though  it is a basic piece of equipment. It's a bouncy castle with slats in the side to allow the air to escape. That's all it is  a bouncy castle. That's the only reason we do it. See  it's all fun  this job. What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes. They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them. And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective. They're great for catching you  up to certain heights. And on the other side of the fence  that physical art  the physical performance of the stuntman  has interfaced with the very highest technology in I.T. and in software. Not the cardboard box  but the green screen. This is a shot of  Terminator   the movie. Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt. It's    feet. It's water. It's very simple. With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it  moving or still  and I can assure you  nowadays you can't see the joint. This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing. Completely in the safety of a studio  and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took  and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by. Decelerator rigs and wires  we use them a lot. We fly people on wires  like this. This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite  or moved around like a kite. And this is a Guinness World Record attempt. They asked me to open their   th anniversary show in     . And again  technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over     meters  and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction  because of the alloys I used in the descender device. And that's Centre Point in London. We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill. Helicopter stunts are always fun  hanging out of them  whatever. And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving. Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today  Project Space Jump. In       Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force did the most spectacular thing. He did a jump from         feet          to be precise  and he did it to test high altitude systems for military pilots in the new range of aircraft that were going up to        feet or so. And I'd just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then. And just how brave he was in       bear in mind. Project Excelsior  it was called. There were three jumps. They first dropped some dummies. So that's the balloon  big gas balloon. It's that shape because the helium has to expand. My balloon will expand to     times and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top. These are the dummies being dropped from         feet  and there is the camera that's strapped to them. You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude. And I'm planning to go from         feet  which is about    miles. You're in a near vacuum in that environment  which is in minus    degrees. So it's an extremely hostile place to be. This is Joe Kittenger himself. Bear in mind  ladies and gents  this was     . He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man. I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago. He's a very humble and wonderful human being. He sent me an email  saying   If you get this thing off the ground I wish you all the best.  And he signed it   Happy landings   which I thought was quite lovely. He's in his   s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy. This is him in a pressure suit. Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is when you get to        feet    it's great  isn't it     When you get to        feet you can really only use oxygen. Above        feet up to nearly        feet  you need pressure breathing  which is where you're wearing a G suit. This is him in his old rock and roll jeans there  pushing him in  those turned up jeans. You need a pressure suit. You need a pressure breathing system with a G suit that squeezes you  that helps you to breathe in and helps you to exhale. Above        feet you need a space suit  a pressure suit. Certainly at         feet no aircraft will fly. Not even a jet engine. It needs to be rocket powered or one of these things  a great big gas balloon. It took me a while  it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job. I've found that team in America now. And it's made of polyethylene  so it's very thin. We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps  and two balloons for the main jump  because they notoriously tear on takeoff. They're just so  so delicate. This is the step off. He's written on that thing   The highest step in the world.  And what must that feel like  I'm excited and I'm scared  both at the same time in equal measures. And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him. A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down. You can just see them there  popping open. Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them. I did quite a lot of research. And you'll see in a second there  he comes back down to the floor. Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon  the little black dots are people. It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous. That's in New Mexico. That's the U.S. Air Force Museum. And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like. My gondola will be more simple than that. It's a three sided box  basically. So I've had to do quite a lot of training. This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains  training in preparation for some high altitude jumps. This is what the view is going to be like at        feet for me. Now you may think this is just a thrill seeking trip  a pleasure ride  just the world's biggest stunt. Well there's a little bit more to it than that. Trying to find a space suit to do this has led me to an area of technology that I never really expected when I set about doing this. I contacted a company in the States who make suits for NASA. That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer. That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars. And it weighs     pounds and you can't skydive in it. So I've been stuck. For the past    years I've been trying to find a space suit that would do this job  or someone that will make one. Something revolutionary happened a little while ago  at the same facility. That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one  the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world. It was made by a Russian that's designed most of the suits of the past    years for the Soviets. He left the company because he saw  as some other people in the space suit industry  an emerging market for space suits for space tourists. You know if you are in an aircraft at        feet and the cabin depressurizes  you can have oxygen. If you're at         feet you die. In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In    seconds you're dead. Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization. The body swells up. It's awful. And so we expect    it's not much fun. We expect  and others expect  that perhaps the FAA  the CAA might say   You need to put someone in a suit that's not inflated  that's connected to the aircraft.  Then they're comfortable  they have good vision  like this great big visor. And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down  in whatever emergency measures  everyone is okay. I would like to bring Costa on  if he's here  to show you the only one of its kind in the world. I was going to wear it  but I thought I'd get Costa to do it  my lovely assistant. Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you  Costa. This is the communication headset you'll see on lots of space suits. It's a two layer suit. NASA suits have got    layers. This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about    pounds. It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me. It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps. Would you just give us a little twirl  please  Costa  Thank you very much. And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated  as you can see from the picture down there. I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel  which means that I can practice everything I need to practice  in safety  before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much  Costa. Ladies and gentlemen  that's just about it from me. The status of my mission at the moment is it still needs a major sponsor. I'm confident that we'll find one. I think it's a great challenge. And I hope that you will agree with me  it is the greatest stunt on Earth. Thank you very much for your time. Most of the time  art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension. There is great confusion when the two look at each other. Art  of course  looks at the world through the psyche  the emotions    the unconscious at times    and of course the aesthetic. Science tends to look at the world through the rational  the quantitative    things that can be measured and described    but it gives art a terrific context of understanding. In the Extreme Ice Survey  we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together  to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better. Specifically  I as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life  am firmly of the belief that photography  video  film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature. In this project  we're specifically interested  of course  in ice. I'm fascinated by the beauty of it  the mutability of it  the malleability of it  and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself. These first images are from Greenland. But ice has another meaning. Ice is the canary in the global coal mine. It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action. Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world. Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less  Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder  What do the computer models say about this  that and the other thing  All of that  strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments  where the ice is  it's real and it's present. The changes are happening. They're very visible. They're photographable. They're measurable.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking. That's outside Antarctica.    percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking  and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing. There is no significant scientific dispute about that. It's been observed  it's measured  it's bomb proof information. And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that. Science is not arguing about that. In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers  ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks  and chunk by chunk by chunk  iceberg by iceberg  turning into global sea level rise. So  having seen all of this in the course of a    year career  I was still a skeptic about climate change until about    years ago  because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models. I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the paleoclimates    the ancient climates    were  as recorded in the ice sheets  as recorded in deep ocean sediments  as recorded in lake sediments  tree rings  and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature. When I realized that climate change was real  and it was not based on computer models  I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically. And that led me to this project. Initially  I was working on a National Geographic assignment    conventional  single frame  still photography. And one crazy day  I got the idea that I should    after that assignment was finished    I got the idea that I should shoot in time lapse photography  that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every    minutes  or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time. Well  within about three weeks  I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time lapse cameras into    time lapse cameras. And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career  trying to design  build and deploy out in the field these    time lapse cameras. They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them. Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire. And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers  and they look in on the glacier from permanent  bedrock positions  and they watch the evolution of the landscape. We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We actually drilled holes into the ice  way deep down below the thawing level  and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so. Actually  there's still a camera out there right now. In any case  the cameras shoot roughly every hour. Some of them shoot every half hour  every    minutes  every five minutes. Here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made. I personally obsessed about every nut  bolt and washer in these crazy things. I spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally. We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere. Our time lapse units are in Alaska  the Rockies  Greenland and Iceland  and we have repeat photography positions  that is places we just visit on an annual basis  in British Columbia  the Alps and Bolivia. It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team. There's a lot of people working on this right now. We've got    cameras out this moment. We just had    cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere  watching what's happened. And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work. We've been out for two and a half years  and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go. That's only half our job. The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public. You know  scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years  but a lot of it stays within the science community. Similarly  a lot of art projects stay in the art community  and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED  and like our relationship with the Obama White House  with the Senate  with John Kerry  to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well. We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming. We have a site on Google Earth that Google Earth was generous enough to give us  and so forth  because we feel very much the need to tell this story  because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now. Now  one bit of science before we get into the visuals. If everybody in the developed world understood this graph  and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads  there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts. Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion. Key issues  this is a         year record. This exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time. And several things are important. Number one  temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync. You can see that from the orange line and the blue line. Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to     parts per million. That's the natural cycle. Goes up to     and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here. But     is the peak. Right now  if you look at the top right part of that graph  we're at     parts per million. We are way  way outside the normal  natural variability. Earth is having a fever. In the past hundred years  the temperature of the Earth has gone up  .  degrees Fahrenheit  .   degrees Celsius  and it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere. At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year. It's been a remorseless  steady increase. We have to turn that around. That's the crux  and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places. But anyway  off to the world of ice. We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska. This is a view of what's called the calving face. This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months. You see the glacier flowing in from the right  dropping off into the sea  camera shooting every hour. If you look in the middle background  you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo yo. That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable  and you're about to see the consequences of that floating. To give you a little bit of a sense of scale  that calving face in this picture is about     feet tall. That's    stories. This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center. The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off  but in fact  it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet. So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock  and floating if it isn't. Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska. This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago. This is an aerial picture we did this year. That's the retreat of this glacier. The main stem  the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and it's going very rapidly up that stem. We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks  and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile  but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places  because as the glaciers    one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge  they're not normal landscapes    but as the glaciers are retreating  they're also deflating  like air is being let out of a balloon. And so  there are features on this landscape. There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture  up above where that arrow comes in  that shows you that a little bit. There's a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there. This is something no self respecting photographer would ever do    you put some cheesy illustration on your shot  right     and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points. But  in any case  the deflation of this glacier since      has been higher than the Eiffel Tower  higher than the Empire State Building. A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated  gone back up valley. These changes in the alpine world are accelerating. It's not static. Particularly in the world of sea ice  the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago  and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with. But in any case  there are big  big changes happening as we speak. So  here's another time lapse shot of Columbia. And you see where it ended in these various spring days  June  May  then October. Now we turn on our time lapse. This camera was shooting every hour. Geologic process in action here. And everybody says  well don't they advance in the winter time  No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier. Finally catches up to itself  it advances. And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange  bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive. We've been talking about  seeing is believing   and seeing the unseen at TED Global. That's what you see with these cameras. The images make the invisible visible. These huge crevasses open up. These great ice islands break off    and now watch this. This has been the springtime this year    a huge collapse. That happened in about a month  the loss of all that ice. So that's where we started three years ago  way out on the left  and that's where we were a few months ago  the last time we went into Columbia. To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat  we did another cheesy illustration  with British double decker buses. If you line up     of those nose to tail  that's about how far back that was. It's a long way. On up to Iceland. One of my favorite glaciers  the S lheimaj kull. And here  if you watch  you can see the terminus retreating. You can see this river being formed. You can see it deflating. Without the photographic process  you would never see this. This is invisible. You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this  but the camera records it. So we wind time backwards now. We go back a couple years in time. That's where it started. That's where it ended a few months ago. And on up to Greenland. The smaller the ice mass  the faster it responds to climate. Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century  but it really started galloping along about    years ago. And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there. It's a big place. That's all ice. All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick  just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle. The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier. We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat  watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat. Here's a two year record of what that looks like. Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale  quickly dwarfed. The calving face is four and a half miles across  and in this shot  as we pull back  you're only seeing about a mile and a half. So  imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out. The interior of Greenland is to the right. It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left. Icebergs  many  many  many  many times the size of this building  are roaring out to sea. We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago  as you can see. June   th  monster calving events happened. I'll show you one of those in a second. This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past    years. It now goes at     feet a day  dumping all this ice into the ocean. It tends to go in these pulses  about every three days  but on average      feet a day  twice the rate it did    years ago. Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier  and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film. We had nine cameras going. This is what a couple of the cameras saw. A     foot tall calving face breaking off. Huge icebergs rolling over. Okay  how big was that  It's hard to get it. So an illustration again  gives you a feeling for scale. A mile of retreat in    minutes across the calving face  in that particular event  three miles wide. The block was three fifths of a mile deep  and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the Tower Bridge in London  about    bridges wide. Or if you take an American reference  to the U.S. Capitol Building and you pack       Capitol Buildings into that block  it would be equivalent to how large that block was.    minutes. Now I've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don't have a problem of economics  technology and public policy. We have a problem of perception. The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues  but we actually can deal with them. I'm certain that we can. But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet. You're an elite audience. You get it. Fortunately  a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now. But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us. And that's where I think organizations like TED  like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along. Because I believe we have an opportunity right now. We are nearly on the edge of a crisis  but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and  in fact  of our century. This is a terrific  terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future. I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you. Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole  across the most northern place in the whole world. And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father. He was a great storyteller. He could tell a story about an event  and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment. And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test. He had been there and watched it go off. And he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense  that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes. And he said that he could actually see an x ray of his fingers  because the light was so bright. And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very  very big impact on my late father. Every holiday I had as a young boy was in a national park. What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world  and show me just how fragile the world is. He also told me about the great explorers. He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott walking all the way to the South Pole and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest. And so ever since I think I was just six years old  I dreamed of going to the polar regions. I really  really wanted to go to the Arctic. There was something about that place which drew me to it. And  well  sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true. But seven years ago  I went to the Arctic for the first time. And it was so beautiful that I've been back there ever since  for the last seven years. I love the place. But I have seen that place change beyond all description  just in that short period of time. I have seen polar bears walking across very  very thin ice in search of food. I have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much. And I have also  every year  seen less and less sea ice. And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there. In the two years before my swim     percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away. And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening. So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world  in a place which should be frozen over  but which now is rapidly unfreezing. And the message was very clear  Climate change is for real  and we need to do something about it. And we need to do something about it right now. Well  swimming across the North Pole  it's not an ordinary thing to do. I mean  just to put it in perspective     degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool. This morning  the temperature of the English Channel was    degrees. The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade. Fresh water freezes at zero. And the water at the North Pole is minus  . . It's fucking freezing. I'm sorry  but there is no other way to describe it. And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task. I assembled this team of    people from    nations. Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport  you just dive into the sea and off you go. It couldn't be further from the truth for me. And I then went and did a huge amount of training  swimming in icy water  backwards and forwards. But the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen. And I had to visualize the swim. I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end. I had to taste the salt water in my mouth. I had to see my coach screaming for me   Come on Lewis  Come on  Go  Go  Go  Don't slow down   And so I literally swam across the North Pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind. And then  after a year of training  I felt ready. I felt confident that I could actually do this swim. So myself and the five members of the team  we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the North Pole. And on day four  we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim. I had never swum in water of minus  .  degrees before  because it's just impossible to train in those types of conditions. So we stopped the ship  as you do. We all got down onto the ice  and I then got into my swimming costume and I dived into the sea. I have never in my life felt anything like that moment. I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air. I was hyperventilating so much  and within seconds my hands were numb. And it was    the paradox is that you're in freezing cold water  but actually you're on fire. I swam as hard as I could for five minutes. I remember just trying to get out of the water. I climbed out of the ice. And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock  because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages. And they were swollen so much  I couldn't even close them. What had happened is that we are made partially of water  and when water freezes it expands. And so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded. And they had burst. And I was in so much agony. I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower. And I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers. And I thought  in two days' time  I was going to do this swim across the North Pole. I was going to try and do a    minute swim  for one kilometer across the North Pole. And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father  was just going out the window. There is no possibility that this was going to happen. And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands. And for a swimmer  you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you. The next morning  I woke up and I was in such a state of depression  and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes. For those of you who don't know him  he's the great British explorer. A number of years ago  he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole. He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea. And after just three minutes in that water  he was able to get himself out. And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England. He went to a local hospital and there they said   Ran  there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers. We are going to actually have to take them off.  And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself. And all I could think of was  if that happened to Ran after three minutes  and I can't feel my hands after five minutes  what on earth is going to happen if I try    minutes  At the very best  I'm going to end up losing some fingers. And at worst  I didn't even want to think about it. We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole. And my close friend David  he saw the way I was thinking  and he came up to me and he said   Lewis  I've known you since you were    years old. I've known you  and I know  Lewis  deep down  right deep down here  that you are going to make this swim. I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training. And I realize the reason why you're going to do this. This is such an important swim. We stand at a very  very important moment in this history  and you're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders. Lewis  have the courage to go in there  because we are going to look after you every moment of it.  And I just  I got so much confidence from him saying that  because he knew me so well. So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole. And we stopped the ship  and it was just as the scientists had predicted. There were open patches of sea everywhere. And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume. And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor  which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate. And then we walked out onto the ice. And I remember looking into the ice  and there were big chunks of white ice in there  and the water was completely black. I had never seen black water before. And it is       meters deep. And I said to myself   Lewis  don't look left  don't look right. Just scuttle forward and go for it.  And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice. Narrator  Video   We're just sailing out of harbor now  and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally. Everything just looks so gray around here  and looks so cold. We've just seen our first polar bears. It was absolutely magical. A mother and a cub  such a beautiful sight. And to think that in        years they could become extinct. It's a very frightening  very  very frightening thought. We're finally at the North Pole. This is months and months and months of dreaming to get here  years of training and planning and preparation. Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim. It's all a little bit frightening  and emotional. Amundson  you ready  Amudson  Ready. Lewis Pugh  Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim. Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off  Man  Take the shoes. Take the shoes. Well done lad  You did it  You did it Lewis  You did it  You did it man  LP  How on earth did we do that  Man  Against the current  You did it against the current  LP  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Audience  Encore  LP  I'd just like to end off by just saying this  It took me four months again to feel my hands. But was it worth it  Yes  absolutely it was. There are very  very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the Arctic. And people ask me   Lewis  what can we do about climate change   And I say to them  I think we need to do three things. The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks. You saw during that video all those flags. Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from. And equally  when it comes to climate change  every single country is going to have to make cuts. Britain  America  Japan  South Africa  the Congo. All of us together  we're all on the same ship together. The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time. I remember  just a few years ago  speaking about climate change  and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even exist. I've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as    years old. Four or five children sitting behind a desk  and even in those poorest conditions  they all have a very  very good grasp of climate change. We need to believe in ourselves. Now is the time to believe. We've come a long way. We're doing good. But the most important thing we must do is  I think  we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around  and ask ourselves a most fundamental question. And that is   What type of world do we want to live in  and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world   Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very  very much. Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds. And the problem I'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy  which is   How can we know whether other people have minds   That is  maybe you have a mind  and everyone else is just a really convincing robot. So that's a problem in philosophy  but for today's purposes I'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind  and that I don't have to worry about this. There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists  which is   Why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes   Or perhaps  more relevantly   Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes   I think novelists put this best. Like Philip Roth  who said   And yet  what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people  So ill equipped are we all  to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims.  So as a teacher and as a spouse  this is  of course  a problem I confront every day. But as a scientist  I'm interested in a different problem of other minds  and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today. And that problem is   How is it so easy to know other minds   So to start with an illustration  you need almost no information  one snapshot of a stranger  to guess what this woman is thinking  or what this man is. And put another way  the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds  our brain  is made up of pieces  brain cells  that we share with all other animals  with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs. And yet  you put them together in a particular network  and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet. Or to say  as Alan Greenspan did   I know you think you understand what you thought I said  but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what I meant.  So  the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas  one in each hand. And to try to understand how you can put together simple units  simple messages over space and time  in a network  and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds. So I'm going to tell you three things about this today. Obviously the whole project here is huge. And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people's thoughts. Some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job. And then finally  to show that some of the differences between people  in how we judge others  can be explained by differences in this brain system. So first  the first thing I want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain  in your brains  whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts. This is a picture of it. It's called the Right Temporo Parietal Junction. It's above and behind your right ear. And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you  or when you read Romeo and Juliet or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan. And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems. So this brain region is called the Right TPJ. And this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults. They're MIT undergraduates. The second thing I want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other minds  we weren't always that way. It takes children a long time to break into the system. I'm going to show you a little bit of that long  extended process. The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five  as kids learn to understand that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own. So I'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task. Rebecca Saxe  Video   This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan. And you know what pirates really like  Child  What  RS  Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. Child  Cheese  I love cheese  RS  Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich  and he says   Yum yum yum yum yum  I really love cheese sandwiches.  And Ivan puts his sandwich over here  on top of the pirate chest. And Ivan says   You know what  I need a drink with my lunch.  And so Ivan goes to get a drink. And while Ivan is away the wind comes  and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass. And now  here comes the other pirate. This pirate is called Joshua. And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches. So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says   Yum yum yum yum yum  I love cheese sandwiches.  And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. Child  So  that one is his. RS  That one is Joshua's. That's right. Child  And then his went on the ground. RS  That's exactly right. Child  So he won't know which one is his. RS  Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink. Ivan comes back and he says   I want my cheese sandwich.  So which one do you think Ivan is going to take  Child  I think he is going to take that one. RS  Yeah  you think he's going to take that one  All right. Let's see. Oh yeah  you were right. He took that one. So that's a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions. Now I'm going to show you a three year old who got the same puzzle. RS  And Ivan says   I want my cheese sandwich.  Which sandwich is he going to take  Do you think he's going to take that one  Let's see what happens. Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan. And he says   I want my cheese sandwich.  And he takes this one. Uh oh. Why did he take that one  Child  His was on the grass. So the three year old does two things differently. First  he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that's really his. And second  when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his  where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his  the three year old comes up with another explanation  He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it  because now it's dirty  on the ground. So that's why he's taking the other sandwich. Now of course  development doesn't end at five. And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now  not for an action prediction  but for a moral judgment. So first I'm going to show you the three year old again. RS.  So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Yeah. RS  Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Yeah. So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan to take Joshua's sandwich  since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich. But now I'm going to show you the five year old. Remember the five year old completely understood why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich. RS  Was Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  Um  yeah. And so  it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response. RS  Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich  Child  No  because the wind should get in trouble. He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches. And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts. So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region  the Right TPJ  being used while children are thinking about other people. But it's not quite like the adult brain. So whereas in the adults  as I told you  this brain region is almost completely specialized    it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts    in children it's much less so  when they are age five to eight  the age range of the children I just showed you. And actually if we even look at eight to    year olds  getting into early adolescence  they still don't have quite an adult like brain region. And so  what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence  both the cognitive system  our mind's ability to think about other minds  and the brain system that supports it are continuing  slowly  to develop. But of course  as you're probably aware  even in adulthood  people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds  how often they do it and how accurately. And so what we wanted to know was  could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region  So  the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids. And I'm going to give that to you now. So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory  and they take a break for coffee. And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee. Grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder  which is sugar. But the powder is labeled  Deadly Poison   so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison. And she puts it in her friend's coffee. And her friend drinks the coffee  and is fine. How many people think it was morally permissible for Grace to put the powder in the coffee  Okay. Good.  Laughter  So we ask people  how much should Grace be blamed in this case  which we call a failed attempt to harm  And we can compare that to another case  where everything in the real world is the same. The powder is still sugar  but what's different is what Grace thinks. Now she thinks the powder is sugar. And perhaps unsurprisingly  if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee  people say she deserves no blame at all. Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison  even though it's really sugar  now people say she deserves a lot of blame  even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. And in fact  they say she deserves more blame in this case  the failed attempt to harm  than in another case  which we call an accident. Where Grace thought the powder was sugar  because it was labeled  sugar  and by the coffee machine  but actually the powder was poison. So even though when the powder was poison  the friend drank the coffee and died  people say Grace deserves less blame in that case  when she innocently thought it was sugar  than in the other case  where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred. People  though  disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame Grace should get in the accident case. Some people think she should deserve more blame  and other people less. And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they're making that judgment. So what I'm showing you  from left to right  is how much activity there was in this brain region  and from top to bottom  how much blame people said that Grace deserved. And what you can see is  on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region  people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident. Whereas on the right  where there was a lot of activity  people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief  and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident. So that's good  but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region  and see if we could change people's moral judgment. And we do have such a tool. It's called Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation  or TMS. This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody's skull  into a small region of their brain  and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. So I'm going to show you a demo of this. First  I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse. I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine. When you hear clicks  we're turning the machine on. So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain  to the part of my brain that controls my hand. So there is no physical force  just a magnetic pulse. Woman  Video   Ready  Rebecca  RS  Yes. Okay  so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain. And we can use that same pulse  now applied to the RTPJ  to ask if we can change people's moral judgments. So these are the judgments I showed you before  people's normal moral judgments. And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ and ask how people's judgments change. And the first thing is  people can still do this task overall. So their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same. They say she deserves no blame. But in the case of a failed attempt to harm  where Grace thought that it was poison  although it was really sugar  people now say it was more okay  she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee. And in the case of the accident  where she thought that it was sugar  but it was really poison and so she caused a death  people say that it was less okay  she deserves more blame. So what I've told you today is that people come  actually  especially well equipped to think about other people's thoughts. We have a special brain system that lets us think about what other people are thinking. This system takes a long time to develop  slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence. And even in adulthood  differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people. But I want to give the last word back to the novelists  and to Philip Roth  who ended by saying   The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living. Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong  and then on careful reconsideration  getting them wrong again.  Thank you. Chris Anderson  So  I have a question. When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments  that sounds alarming. Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon  say. RS  I'm not. I mean  they're calling  but I'm not taking the call. CA  They really are calling  So then seriously  you must lie awake at night sometimes wondering where this work leads. I mean  you're clearly an incredible human being  but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not torture chamber  do acts that people here might be worried about. RS  Yeah  we worry about this. So  there's a couple of things to say about TMS. One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it. So it's not a surreptitious technology. It's quite hard  actually  to get those very small changes. The changes I showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain  but they're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make. And what we changed was not people's moral judgments when they're deciding what to do  when they're making action choices. We changed their ability to judge other people's actions. And so  I think of what I'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial  but studying the jury. CA  Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education  to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments  RS  That's one of the idealistic hopes. The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new. Until recently  what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too  so we could study it in animal models. We knew how brains see  and how they control the body and how they hear and sense. And the whole project of understanding how brains do the uniquely human things    learn language and abstract concepts  and thinking about other people's thoughts    that's brand new. And we don't know yet what the implications will be of understanding it. CA  So I've got one last question. There is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness  that puzzles a lot of people. The notion that you can understand why a brain works  perhaps. But why does anyone have to feel anything  Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate  You're a brilliant young neuroscientist. I mean  what chances do you think there are that at some time in your career  someone  you or someone else  is going to come up with some paradigm shift in understanding what seems an impossible problem  RS  I hope they do. And I think they probably won't. CA  Why  RS  It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing. CA  That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe  thank you very much. That was fantastic. These are grim economic times  fellow TEDsters  grim economic times indeed. And so  I would like to cheer you up with one of the great  albeit largely unknown  commercial success stories of the past    years. Comparable  in its own very peculiar way  to the achievements of Microsoft or Google. And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity. I refer to organized crime. Now organized crime has been around for a very long time  I hear you say  and these would be wise words  indeed. But in the last two decades  it has experienced an unprecedented expansion  now accounting for roughly    percent of the world's GDP. I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy  or McMafia  for short. So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross border crime  Well  of course  there is globalization  technology  communications  all that stuff  which we'll talk about a little bit later. But first  I would like to take you back to this event  the collapse of communism. All across Eastern Europe  a most momentous episode in our post war history. Now it's time for full disclosure. This event meant a great deal to me personally. I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe  like Solidarity in Poland  when I was in my teens. I then started writing about Eastern Europe  and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region  which is what I was doing in     . And so when     million people finally won the right to choose their own governments  I was ecstatic  but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall. It wasn't long  for example  before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia. And amongst the chaos  amidst the euphoria  it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before       in Eastern Europe  continued to do so after the revolutions there. Obviously there were characters like this. But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe. Like this character. Remember these guys  They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling  every four years in the Olympics  and they were the great celebrities of communism  with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it. They used to get great apartments in the center of town  casual sex on tap  and they could travel to the West very freely  which was a great luxury at the time. It may come as a surprise  but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe. Or as I like to call them  they are the midwives of capitalism. Here are some of those same weightlifters after their      makeover. Now in Bulgaria    this photograph was taken in Bulgaria    when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe  it wasn't just communism  it was the state that collapsed as well. That means your police force wasn't working. The court system wasn't functioning properly. So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored  Well  he would turn to people who were called  rather prosaically by sociologists  privatized law enforcement agencies. We prefer to know them as the mafia. And in Bulgaria  the mafia was soon joined with        people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between      and     . Now  when your state is collapsing  your economy is heading south at a rate of knots  the last people you want coming on to the labor market are        men and women whose chief skills are surveillance  are smuggling  building underground networks and killing people. But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe. Now  when I was working in the     s  I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia. And I couldn't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities  the paramilitary organizations  were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates. And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise. And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen  by talking to victims  by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services. But above all else  by talking to the gangsters themselves. And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start. Why  Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing  but also  as they say in the retail trade  it's location  location  location. And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world. Heroin  cocaine  women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals. And where were they heading  The European Union  which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization  transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history  eventually comprising some     million people. And a significant minority of those     million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes  sticking    Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers. Now  organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business. It has zones of production  like Afghanistan and Columbia. It has zones of distribution  like Mexico and the Balkans. And then  of course  it has zones of consumption  like the European Union  Japan and of course  the United States. The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world  and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed. Take Mexico  for example. Six thousand people killed there in the last    months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade. But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo  Since       five million people have died there. It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers  but it's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War. And why is it  Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region. In the year          percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Now  coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone  in almost every laptop and games console. The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons  and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets. And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime. Now  let me show you some of my friends in action  caught conveniently on film by the Italian police  and smuggling duty not paid cigarettes. Now  cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap. The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world. So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.  there are very handsome profits to be made  and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups. This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new. And it's the fastest thing on European waters. From       for seven years     of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic  from Montenegro to Italy  every single night. And as a consequence of this trade  Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue. And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals. Now Italian police  when this trade started  had just two boats which could go at the same speed. And this is very important  because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas. Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution  and if the police intervened  they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning  rather than chasing the bad guys. So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats  how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys. And the answer is six vessels. And remember     of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night. So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making  Well  this is where we come to globalization  because that was not just the deregulation of global trade. It was the liberalization of international financial markets. And boy  did that make it easy for the money launderers. The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre. In the     s  we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business  and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering. And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked. But at the heart of this  is the offshore banking network. Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade  and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime  money laundering  you have to get rid of them. On a positive note  we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities. And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation  regulation  effective regulation  I say  let's take a look at Bernie Madoff  who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail. Bernie Madoff stole    billion dollars. That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates  but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street  and no regulator picked up on it. So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London  fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering  Well I can tell you  it's quite a few of them. Let me go on to the     of international organized crime now. And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning. This one  however  is in central British Columbia where I photographed it. It's one of the tens of thousands of mom and pop grow ops in B.C. which ensure that over five percent of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade. Now  I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera  of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it  of course  down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud  as it's called  in part because it's marketed as organic  which of course goes down very well in California. Now  even by the police's admission  this makes not a dent in the profits  really  of the major exporters. Since the beginning of globalization  the global narcotics market has expanded enormously. There has  however  been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces. This  however  may all be about to change  because something very strange is going on. The United Nations recognized earlier this    it was last month actually    that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs. Interestingly  the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down  because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs. Now that is a game changer  because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world. When that happens  it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West. The drugs policy which we've had in place for    years is long overdue for a very serious rethink  in my opinion. Now  the recession. Well  organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession. Not surprising  the most opportunistic industry in the whole world. And it has no rules to its regulatory system. Except  of course  it has two business risks  arrest by law enforcement  which is  frankly  the least of their worries  and competition from other groups  i.e. a bullet in the back of the head. What they've done is they've shifted their operations. People don't smoke as much dope  or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession. And so instead  they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way  but above all  two sectors  and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime. And it's been terribly successful. I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle. Or perhaps I should say  more accurately  Se or Pringle. I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal. We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in S o Paulo  together. Hooked it up to my laptop  and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank. It's really not that difficult. And it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology. The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering. Or to use the technical term for it  there's one born every minute. You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest. And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this  of course  the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love. I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus  one of the very great worldwide viruses that came. I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out  because the first person I received it from was an ex girlfriend of mine. Now  she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time  but love was not amongst them. And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox  I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection. So  cybercrime  do watch out for it. One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys. These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense. Now  Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection. But over the past year or so  researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance. And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market  and so they buy it from the Internet. And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient. Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance. The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives. You don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime. They affect our bank accounts. They affect our communications  our pension funds. They even affect the food that we eat and our governments. This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York. There is no romance involved with gangsters in the   st Century. This is a mighty industry  and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes. It is a major economic force and we need to take it very  very seriously. It's been a privilege talking to you. Thank you very much. The public debate about architecture quite often just stays on contemplating the final result  the architectural object. Is the latest tower in London a gherkin or a sausage or a sex tool  So recently  we asked ourselves if we could invent a format that could actually tell the stories behind the projects  maybe combining images and drawings and words to actually sort of tell stories about architecture. And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it  it already existed in the form of a comic book. So we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes  how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation. Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities and the incidents of the real world. We call this comic book  Yes is More   which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes. In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More. He triggered the modernist revolution. After him followed the post modern counter revolution  Robert Venturi saying   Less is a bore.  After him  Philip Johnson sort of introduced you could say promiscuity  or at least openness to new ideas with   I am a whore.  Recently  Obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis. And what we'd like to say with  Yes is More  is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant garde is almost always negatively defined  as who or what we are against. The cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment. Or this idea of the misunderstood genius  frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas. Rather than revolution  we're much more interested in evolution  this idea that things gradually evolve by adapting and improvising to the changes of the world. In fact  I actually think that Darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process. His famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagram of the way we work. As you can see  a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings. At each meeting  there's way too many ideas. Only the best ones can survive. And through a process of architectural selection  we might choose a really beautiful model or we might have a very functional model. We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring. And through these sort of generations of design meetings we arrive at a design. A very literal way of showing it is a project we did for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen. The design process was really tough  almost like a struggle for survival  but gradually an idea evolved  this sort of idea of a rational tower that melts together with the surrounding city  sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome  but sort of public on the outside  as well as on the inside  with the library. But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea. As you can see  sometimes a subspecies branches off. And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea. It doesn't really work in this context. But for another client in another culture  it could really be the right answer to a different question. So as a result  we never throw anything out. We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity. You never know when you might need it. And what I'd like to do now  in an act of warp speed storytelling  is tell the story of how two projects evolved by adapting and improvising to the happenstance of the world. The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai to do the competition for the Danish National Pavilion for the World Expo in     . And we saw this guy  Haibao. He's the mascot of the expo  and he looks strangely familiar. In fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of Sweden. When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought it was a really cool scheme  but it didn't exactly look like something from the north of Sweden. The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost. But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman who saw our design and said   Wow  that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'  So  apparently this is how you write  people   as in the People's Republic of China. We even double checked. And at the same time  we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week. So we thought like  this is too much of an opportunity  so we hired a feng shui master. We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions  and went to China. So the People's Building  as we called it. This is our two interpreters  sort of reading the architecture. It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper  which got Mr. Liangyu Chen  the mayor of Shanghai  to visit the exhibition. And we had the chance to explain the project. And he said   Shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers   but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over. And with the People's Building  he saw an architecture that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China and the progressive future of China. So we obviously profoundly agreed with him. Unfortunately  Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption. But like I said  Haibao looked very familiar  because he is actually the Chinese character for  people.  And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is  Better City  Better Life.  Sustainability. And we thought  sustainability has grown into being this sort of neo Protestant idea that it has to hurt in order to do good. You know  you're not supposed to take long  warm showers. You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment. Gradually  you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life. So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples where a sustainable city actually increases the quality of life. We also asked ourselves  what could Denmark possibly show China that would be relevant  You know  it's one of the biggest countries in the world  one of the smallest. China symbolized by the dragon. Denmark  we have a national bird  the swan. China has many great poets  but we discovered that in the People's Republic public school curriculum  they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng  or Hans Christian Anderson  as we call him. So that means that all  .  billion Chinese have grown up with  The Emperor's New Clothes    The Matchstick Girl  and  The Little Mermaid.  It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture integrated into Chinese culture. The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall. The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon. The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid. That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours. And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities. Copenhagen  Shanghai  modern  European. But then we looked at recent urban development  and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street     years ago. All bikes  no cars. This is how it looks today  all traffic jam. Bicycles have become forbidden many places. Meanwhile  in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes. A third of all the people commute by bike. We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike that you can borrow if you visit the city. So we thought  why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China  We donate       bikes to Shanghai. So if you come to the expo  go straight to the Danish pavilion  get a Danish bike  and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions. Like I said  Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities  but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean that you can actually swim in it. One of the first projects we ever did was the harbor bath in Copenhagen  sort of continuing the public realm into the water. So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda  images  statements  but no real experience. So just like with a bike  we don't talk about it. You can try it. Like with the water  instead of talking about it  we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water from Copenhagen to Shanghai  so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is. This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable to sail water from Copenhagen to China. But in fact  the container ships go full of goods from China to Denmark  and then they sail empty back. So quite often you load water for ballast. So we can actually hitch a ride for free. And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath  we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid. So the real Mermaid  the real water  and the real bikes. And when she's gone  we're going to invite a Chinese artist to reinterpret her. The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop of exhibition and bikes. When you go to the exhibition  you'll see the Mermaid and the pool. You'll walk around  start looking for a bicycle on the roof  jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo. So when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project. And to our surprise we got one of our boards back with corrections from the Chinese state censorship. The first thing  the China map missed Taiwan. It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on. The second thing  we had compared the swan to the dragon  and then the Chinese state said   Suggest change to panda.  So  when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument  the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it. They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid. So for the first time  I got invited to speak at the National Parliament. It was kind of interesting because in the morning  from   to     they were discussing the bailout package    how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy. And then at    o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues. And then from    to    they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China. But to conclude  if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December next year  don't come to Copenhagen  because she's going to be in Shanghai. If you do come to Copenhagen  you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei  the Chinese artist. But if the Chinese government intervenes  it might even be a panda. So the second story that I'd like to tell is  actually starts in my own house. This is my apartment. This is the view from my apartment  over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony. And they form this sort of vertical backyard where  on a nice summer day  you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of    meters. The house is sort of a distortion of a square block. Trying to zigzag it to make sure that all of the apartments look at the straight views  instead of into each other. Until recently  this was the view from my apartment  onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site. And he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure. And we thought  rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments looking straight into a big boring block of cars  why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses  put them on a podium of cars. And because Copenhagen is completely flat  if you want to have a nice south facing slope with a view  you basically have to do it yourself. Then we sort of cut up the volume  so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment. And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments. And up in the sun  you have a single layer of apartments that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle  like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view  and a sort of dense urban location. This is our first architectural model. This is an aerial photo taken last summer. And essentially  the apartments cover the parking. They are accessed through this diagonal elevator. It's actually a stand up product from Switzerland  because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators. And the facade of the parking  we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated  so we needed to perforate it. And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes  we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic  naturally ventilated  rasterized image. And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain  we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest  making the entire building a       square meter artwork. So if you go back into the parking  into the corridors  it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors  into this sort of south facing urban oasis. The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades. If you go even further  it turns into this green garden. And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain is actually accumulated. And there is an automatic irrigation system that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens  in one or two years it will sort of transform into a Cambodian temple ruin  completely covered in green. So  the Mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy. This idea that you can actually create  if not gold  then at least added value by mixing traditional ingredients  like normal apartments and normal parking  and in this case actually offer people the chance that they don't have to choose between a life with a garden or a life in the city. They can actually have both. As an architect  it's really hard to set the agenda. You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city in central Asia  because that's not really how you get commissions. You always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen  and the sort of turmoil of the world. One last example is that recently we  like last summer  we won the competition to design a Nordic national bank. This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling. It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity. Unfortunately  it was the national bank of Iceland. At the same time  we actually had a visitor    a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office. We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited by this idea that you could actually make mountains out of architecture  because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia. So he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of Azerbaijan. So we took the commission. And we made this small movie that I'd like to show. We quite often make little movies. We always argue a lot about the soundtrack  but in this case it was really easy to choose the song. So basically  Baku is this sort of crescent bay overlooking the island of Zira  the island that we are planning    almost like the diagram of their flag. And our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of Azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures  inhabitable of human life. Then we place these mountains on the island  surrounding this sort of central green valley  almost like a central park. And what makes it interesting is that the island right now is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation. It has no water. It has no energy  no resources. So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem  exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants  and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings. And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape  gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green  lush landscape. So  you can say where an urban development normally happens at the expense of nature  in this case it's actually creating nature. And the buildings  they don't only sort of invoke the imagery of the mountains  they also operate like mountains. They create shelter from the wind. They accumulate the solar energy. They accumulate the water. So they actually transform the entire island into a single ecosystem. So we recently presented the master plan  and it has gotten approved. And this summer we are starting the construction documents of the two first mountains  in what's going to be the first carbon neutral island in Central Asia. Yes  maybe just to round off. So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan. With a little luck and some more evolution  maybe in    years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars. Thank you. So the question is  what is invisible  There is more of it than you think  actually. Everything  I would say. Everything that matters except every thing and except matter. We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter. As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently   The marriage suffered a setback in       when the husband was killed by the wife.  There's a world of invisibility there  isn't there  So  we can see the stars and the planets  but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together. With matter  as with people  we see only the skin of things. We can't see into the engine room. We can't see what makes people tick  at least not without difficulty. And the closer we look at anything  the more it disappears. In fact  if you look really closely at stuff  if you look at the basic substructure of matter  there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz  and there is only energy. And you can't see energy. So everything that matters  that's important  is invisible. One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story  which is invisible to you. And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds. It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens. The late Geoffrey Dickens  M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency. Wherever he went  at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness. Try as he might  he couldn't get away from her. A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him  had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph. After her name  written in brackets was the apt description  horse face.  I've misjudged this women   thought Mr. Dickens.  Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness  she turns it to her advantage. A photo is not enough.  So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in. And on the photograph  he wrote with a flourish   To Horse Face  with love from Geoffrey Dickens  M.P.  After it had been sent off  his secretary said to him   Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete  I wrote Horse Face on her  so you'd remember who she was.  I bet he thought he wished he was invisible  don't you  So  one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand. It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces  and the weakest. And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth  Sir Isaac Newton  the greatest scientist who ever lived  he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So  bright guy  could be wrong on that one  I don't know. Consciousness. I see all your faces. I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing  Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds  But we can touch each other  taste each other perhaps  if we get close enough. But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith  this great Middle Eastern religion  which some claim is the route of all religions  Sufi masters are all telepaths  so they say. But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists  the Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence  artificial intelligence has really  like the study of consciousness  gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works. With artificial intelligence  not only have they not created artificial intelligence  they haven't yet created artificial stupidity. The laws of physics  invisible  eternal  omnipresent  all powerful. Remind you of anyone  Interesting. I'm  as you can guess  not a materialist  I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful new word  ignostic. Okay  I'm an ignostic. I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists  until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see is the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar  because about    years ago  when they started delving into the genome  they thought it would probably contain around         genes. Geneticists will know this  but every year since  it's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely to be only just over        genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary. Because rice    get this    rice is known to have    thousand genes. Potatoes  potatoes have    chromosomes. Do you know that  Two more than people  and the same as a gorilla. You can't see these things  but they are very strange. The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is  the less you can see. Time  nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. Modern physics  there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist  because it's too inconvenient for the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future  obviously. And you can't see the past  except in your memory. One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day  he said   Dad  can you remember what I was like when I was two   And I said   Yes.  And he said   Why can't I   Isn't that extraordinary  You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three  which is great news for psychoanalysts  because otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know  some of you  that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff. Skin flakes off  hairs grow  nails  that kind of stuff. But every cell in your body is replaced at some point. Taste buds  every    days or so. Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years  not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago. The question is  who  then  are we  What are we  What is this thing that we hang on  that is actually us  Okay. Atoms  you can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light. Gas  you can't see that. Interesting. Somebody mentioned      recently. Gas was invented in      by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word called  blas   meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on  unfortunately. But well done  him. There is so many things that    Light. You can't see light. When it's dark  in a vacuum  if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes  you won't see it. Slightly technical  some physicists will disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light  you can only see what it hits. I find that extraordinary  not to be able to see light  not to be able to see darkness. Electricity  you can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity. They don't. Nobody knows what it is. You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire  don't you  at the speed of light when you turn the light on. They don't. Electrons bumble down the wire  about the speed of spreading honey  they say. Galaxies      billion of them estimated in the universe.     billion. How many can we see  Five. Five out of the     billion galaxies  with the naked eye  and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz  when he discovered radio waves in       he called them radio waves because they radiated. And somebody said to him   Well what's the point of these  Heinrich  What's the point of these radio waves that you've found   And he said   Well  I've no idea. But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday.  And that's what they do  radio. That's what they discovered. Anyway  so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said   We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything.  And I've come to the conclusion    because you've asked this other question   What's another thing you can't see   The point  most of us. What's the point  You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless  like an electron  oddly enough. But the point  what I've got it down to  is there are only two questions really worth asking.  Why are we here   and  What should we do about it while we are  And to help you  I've got two things to leave you with  from two great philosophers  perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the   th century  one a mathematician and an engineer  and the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said   I don't know why we are here. But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves.  He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he  And secondly and lastly  W.H. Auden  one of my favorite poets  who said   We are here on earth to help others. What the others are here for  I've no idea.  We see with the eyes  but we see with the brain as well. And seeing with the brain is often called imagination. And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination  our inscapes.  We've lived with them all our lives. But there are also hallucinations as well  and hallucinations  are completely different. They don't seem to be of our creation. They don't seem to be under our control. They seem to come from the outside  and to mimic perception. So I am going to be talking about hallucinations  and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients. A few months ago  I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work. They told me that one of their residents  an old lady in her   s  was seeing things  and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers or  because she was an old lady  whether she'd had a stroke  or whether she had Alzheimer's. And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie  the old lady. I went in to see her. It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and  of good intelligence  but she'd been very startled and very bewildered  because she'd been seeing things. And she told me    the nurses hadn't mentioned this    that she was blind  that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years. But now  for the last few days  she'd been seeing things. So I said   What sort of things   And she said   People in Eastern dress  in drapes  walking up and down stairs. A man who turns towards me and smiles. But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth. Animals too. I see a white building. It's snowing  a soft snow. I see this horse with a harness  dragging the snow away. Then  one night  the scene changes. I see cats and dogs walking towards me. They come to a certain point and then stop. Then it changes again. I see a lot of children. They are walking up and down stairs. They wear bright colors  rose and blue  like Eastern dress.  Sometimes  she said  before the people come on  she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor  which seem to go up to the ceiling. I said   Is this like a dream   And she said   No  it's not like a dream. It's like a movie.  She said   It's got color. It's got motion. But it's completely silent  like a silent movie.  And she said that it's a rather boring movie. She said   All these people with Eastern dress  walking up and down  very repetitive  very limited.  And she has a sense of humor. She knew it was a hallucination. But she was frightened. She'd lived    years and she'd never had a hallucination before. She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing  that they seemed to come on by themselves  or disappear. She had no control over them. She said she didn't recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations. And none of the people or the animals  well  they all seemed oblivious of her. And she didn't know what was going on. She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind. Well  I examined her carefully. She was a bright old lady  perfectly sane. She had no medical problems. She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations. But she was blind. And I then said to her   I think I know what you have.  I said   There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness. This was originally described   I said   right back in the   th century  by a man called Charles Bonnet. And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome. There is nothing wrong with your brain. There is nothing wrong with your mind. You have Charles Bonnet syndrome.  And she was very relieved at this  that there was nothing seriously the matter  and also rather curious. She said   Who is this Charles Bonnet   She said   Did he have them himself   And she said   Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.   I'm not crazy. I'm not demented. I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.  Well  so I did tell the nurses. Now this  for me  is a common situation. I work in old age homes  largely. I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired. About    percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations. And about    percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations. You don't have to be completely blind  only sufficiently impaired. Now with the original description in the   th century  Charles Bonnet did not have them. His grandfather had these hallucinations. His grandfather was a magistrate  an elderly man. He'd had cataract surgery. His vision was pretty poor. And in       he described to his grandson various things he was seeing. The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair. It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles. And he knew it was a hallucination. You don't have handkerchiefs in midair. And then he saw a big wheel in midair. But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not  because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions. So on one occasion  when his granddaughters were visiting them  he said   And who are these handsome young men with you   And they said   Alas  Grandpapa  there are no handsome young men.  And then the handsome young men disappeared. It's typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash. They don't usually fade in and out. They are rather sudden  and they change suddenly. Charles Lullin  the grandfather  saw hundreds of different figures  different landscapes of all sorts. On one occasion  he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe  and realized it was himself. That was the only figure he recognized. On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris  he saw    this was real    a scaffolding. But when he got back home  he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high  on his study table. This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia. With him and with Rosalie  what seems to be going on    and Rosalie said   What's going on      and I said that as you lose vision  as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input  they become hyperactive and excitable  and they start to fire spontaneously. And you start to see things. The things you see can be very complicated indeed. With another patient of mine  who  also had some vision  the vision she had could be disturbing. On one occasion  she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant. And he turned around. And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts  who started walking towards her. And then the six figures came together again  like a concertina. Once  when she was driving  or rather  her husband was driving  the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads. She had very mobile hallucinations as well. A lot of them had to do with a car. Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car. He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned. And then when they came to a stop  the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff      foot in the air  and then disappear. Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination. This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes  but the visual parts of her brain  a little tumor in the occipital cortex. And  above all  she would see cartoons. These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field  like a screen. And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog. Now  I don't watch Sesame Street  but she made a point of saying   Why Kermit   she said   Kermit the Frog means nothing to me. You know  I was wondering about Freudian determinants. Why Kermit  Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.  She didn't mind the cartoons too much. But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie  the faces were often deformed  with very large teeth or very large eyes. And these frightened her. Well  what is going on with these people  As a physician  I have to try and define what's going on  and to reassure people  especially to reassure them that they're not going insane. Something like    percent  as I said  of visually impaired people get these. But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them  because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something. And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed. In particular  the notion is that if you see things or hear things  you're going mad  but the psychotic hallucinations  are quite different. Psychotic hallucinations  whether they are visual or vocal  they address you. They accuse you. They seduce you. They humiliate you. They jeer at you. You interact with them. There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations. There is a film. You're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you  or that's how people think about it. There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy  and sometimes  if one has this  one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past. You're at a particular road junction. You smell chestnuts roasting. You hear the traffic. All the senses are involved. And you're waiting for your girl. And it's that Tuesday evening back in     . And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations  full of feeling  full of familiarity  located in space and time  coherent  dramatic. The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different. So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations  you have all sorts of levels  from the geometrical hallucinations    the pink and blue squares the woman had    up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces. Faces  and sometimes deformed faces  are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations. And one of the second commonest is cartoons. So  what is going on  Fascinatingly  in the last few years  it's been possible to do functional brain imagery  to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating. And in fact  to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating. When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations  the primary visual cortex is activated. This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns. You don't form images with your primary visual cortex. When images are formed  a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe. And in particular  one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus. And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus  they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces. But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus  they may hallucinate faces  and this is exactly what you find in some of these people. There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented  and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations. There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons. It's activated when one recognizes cartoons  when one draws cartoons  and when one hallucinates them. It's very interesting that that should be specific. There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes. Around       it was found that there were not only parts of the brain  but particular cells.  Face cells  were discovered around     . And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells  which can be very  very specific. So you may not only have  car  cells  you may have  Aston Martin  cells. I saw an Aston Martin this morning. I had to bring it in. And now it's in there somewhere. Now  at this level  in what's called the inferotemporal cortex  there are only visual images  or figments or fragments. It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion. And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome  you don't go to those higher levels. You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images  or figments  or fragmentary figments  all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells. Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception  or imagination  and one is not conscious of them. It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted. And instead of getting normal perception  you're getting an anarchic  convulsive stimulation  or release  of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex. So  suddenly you see a face. Suddenly you see a car. Suddenly this  and suddenly that. The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this  but not terribly successfully. When these were first described  it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams. But in fact people say   I don't recognize the people. I can't form any associations.   Kermit means nothing to me.  You don't get anywhere thinking of them as dreams. Well  I've more or less said what I wanted. I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common. Think of the number of blind people. There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations  but are too scared to mention them. So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice  for patients  for doctors  for the public. Finally  I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable  for giving one some insight as to how the brain works. Charles Bonnet said      years ago    he wondered how  thinking these hallucinations  how  as he put it  the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain. Now      years later  I think we're beginning to glimpse how this is done. Thanks very much. Chris Anderson  That was superb. Thank you so much. You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients. Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about  Oliver Sacks  I was afraid you'd ask that. Well  yeah  a lot of them. And actually I'm a little visually impaired myself. I'm blind in one eye  and not terribly good in the other. And I see the geometrical hallucinations. But they stop there. CA  And they don't disturb you  Because you understand what's doing it  it doesn't make you worried  OS  Well they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus  which I ignore. They occasionally interest me  and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks. I've gone and had an fMRI myself  to see how my visual cortex is taking over. And when I see all these hexagons and complex things  which I also have  in visual migraine  I wonder whether everyone sees things like this  and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit. CA  That was an utterly  utterly fascinating talk. Thank you so much for sharing. OS  Thank you. Thank you. My name is Jonathan Zittrain  and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist. So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist  and give reason to hope for the future of the Internet by drawing upon its present. Now  it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before. People are less kind. There is less trust around. I don't know. As a simple example  we could run a test here. How many people have ever hitchhiked  I know. How many people have hitchhiked within the past    years  Right. So what has changed  It's not better public transportation. So that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists  going in the wrong direction. But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction  and it's the Internet helping it along. So example number one  the Internet itself. These are three of the founders of the Internet. They were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the     s. You might have had a French club or a Debate club. They had a  Let's build a global network  club  and it worked out very well. They are pictured here for their   th anniversary Newsweek retrospective on the Internet. And as you can tell  they are basically goof balls. They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network. The limitation was that they didn't have any money. No particular amount of capital to invest  of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight. They had none of that. But they had an amazing freedom  which was they didn't have to make any money from it. The Internet has no business plan  never did. No CEO  no firm responsible  singly  for building it. Instead  it's folks getting together to do something for fun  rather than because they were told to  or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it. That ethos led to a network architecture  a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since. So unusual  in fact  that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work. As late as       IBM was known to say you couldn't possibly build a corporate network using Internet Protocol. And even some Internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out. That's why the mascot of Internet engineering  if it had one  is said to be the bumblebee. Because the fur to wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly. And yet  mysteriously  somehow the bee flies. I'm pleased to say that  thanks to massive government funding  about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly. It's very complicated  but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly. So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual  Well  to move data around from one place to another    again  it's not like a package courier. It's more like a mosh pit. Imagine  you being part of a network where  you're maybe at a sporting event  and you're sitting in rows like this  and somebody asks for a beer  and it gets handed at the aisle. And your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along  at risk to your own trousers  to get it to the destination. No one pays you to do this. It's just part of your neighborly duty. And  in a way  that's exactly how packets move around the Internet  sometimes in as many as    or    hops  with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver. Now  of course  in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination. You need a lot of trust  but it's not like   I'm trying to get to Pensacola  please.  So the Internet needs addressing and directions. It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet. Instead  again  it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater  but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us. So what do we do to figure out who is where  We turn to the person on the right  and we tell that person what we see on our left  and vice versa. And they can lather  rinse  repeat. And before you know it  you have a general sense of where everything is. This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work. This is a system that relies on kindness and trust  which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable. In rare but striking instances  a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble. So  for example  last year  the government of Pakistan asked its Internet service providers there to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube. There was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked. This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the Internet. Well this one ISP in Pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way. It advertised    the way that you might be asked  if you were part of the Internet  to declare what you see near you    it advertised that near it  in fact  it had suddenly awakened to find that it was YouTube.  That's right   it said   I am YouTube.  Which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to YouTube stopped at the ISP  since they thought they were already there  and the ISP threw them away unopened because the point was to block it. But it didn't stop there. You see  that announcement went one click out  which got reverberated  one click out. And it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event  you have at one moment perfectly working YouTube. Then  at moment number two  you have the fake announcement go out. And within two minutes  it reverberates around and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world. If you were sitting in Oxford  England  trying to get to YouTube  your packets were going to Pakistan and they weren't coming back. Now just think about that. One of the most popular websites in the world  run by the most powerful company in the world  and there was nothing that YouTube or Google were particularly privileged to do about it. And yet  somehow  within about two hours  the problem was fixed. How did this happen  Well  for a big clue  we turn to NANOG. The North American Network Operators Group  a group of people who  on a beautiful day outside  enter into a windowless room  at their terminals reading email and messages in fixed proportion font  like this  and they talk about networks. And some of them are mid level employees at Internet service providers around the world. And here is the message where one of them says   Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube  This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise. Something is up in Pakistan.  And they came together to help find the problem and fix it. So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire. The bad news is there is no fire brigade. The good news is random people apparate from nowhere  put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise. I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers. You know  it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help. And it turns out this model is everywhere  once you start looking for it. Example number two  Wikipedia. If a man named Jimbo came up to you in      and said   I've got a great idea  We start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything  at any time  and we'll get a great encyclopedia  Eh   Right. Dumbest idea ever. In fact  Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid that even Jimbo never had it. Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia. It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy  and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles. The wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits    as almost an afterthought  a back room. And then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project. And today  Wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus. I am not making this up. I have a theory I can explain later. Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir fried with pimentos. But now  Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work. How does it really work  It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless  metaphorically speaking. And there are a bunch of people who  on a sunny day  would rather be inside and monitoring this  the administrator's notice board  itself a wiki page that anyone can edit. And you just bring your problems to the page. It's reminiscent of the description of history as  one damn thing after another   right  Number one   Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil.  Apologies  Andyvphil  if you're here today. I'm not taking sides.  Anon attacking me for reverting.  Here is my favorite   A long story.  It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page. And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat. At all times  Wikipedia is approximately    minutes away from utter destruction. Right  There are spambots crawling it  trying to turn every article into an ad for a Rolex watch. It's this thin geeky line that keeps it going. Not because it's a job  not because it's a career  but because it's a calling. It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it. They even gather together in such groups as the Counter Vandalism Unit     Civility  Maturity  Responsibility     to just clean up the pages. It does make you wonder if there were  for instance  a massive  extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend  who would be minding the store  So what we see    what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed  late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands  and here in South Kensington  that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else  you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function  and one in which they are more human with each other. They're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do. And Wikipedia has embraced this. Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid  the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever  acting as if it were a light saber. The film  without his permission or even knowledge at first  found its way onto the Internet. Hugely viral video. Extremely popular. Totally mortifying to him. Now  it being encyclopedic and all  Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid. Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page  and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article. You could see arguments on both sides. Here is just a snapshot of some of them. They eventually decided    not unanimously by any means    not to include his real name  despite the fact that nearly all media reports did. They just didn't think it was the right thing to do. It was an act of kindness. And to this day  the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page. If you do  it will be removed immediately  removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision  but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion. As a lawyer  I've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. Now  this isn't just limited to Wikipedia. We see it on blogs all over the place. I mean  this is a      Business Week cover. Wow. Blogs are going to change your business. I know they look silly. And sure they look silly. They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. This is my favorite goofy blog  Catsthatlooklikehitler.com. You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler. Yeah  I know. Number four  it's like  can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday  But then  you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people. So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture. This one says   Bucolic meadow with split rail fence. Is that an animal carcass behind her   You're like   You know  I think that's an animal carcass behind her.  And it's one after the other. But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner. That's it. Image removed at request of owner. It turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site  not with a legal threat  not with an offer of payment  but just said   Hey  would you mind   The person said   No  that's fine.  I believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do  to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact  and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it. I even think it can go into the real world. We can end up  as we get in a world with more censors    everywhere there is something filming you  maybe putting it online    to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says   You know  I'd rather not.  And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later  this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big  if you don't mind. And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it. In the real world  we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan. And we now have means that we can build  like this system  so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it. And it's no longer just a  I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on   but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online. In fact  talk about technology imitating life imitating tech  or maybe it's the other way around. An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them  and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination. It said   Can you help me get there   Released it on the streets of Manhattan. They'll fund anything these days. Here is the chart of over    people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way  from one corner from one corner of Washington Square Park to another. That leads to example number three  hitchhiking. I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead. Why  There is the Craigslist rideshare board. If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board  tumbleweeds would be blowing through it. But it's the rideshare board  and it's basically the same thing. Now why are people using it  I don't know. Maybe they think that  uh  killers don't plan ahead  No. I think the actual answer is that once you reframe it  once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day  but now  for whatever reason  is tarnished  you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on Craigslist represents. And then you can highlight it into something like  yes  CouchSurfing.org. CouchSurfing  one guy's idea to  at last  put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free  with people who live far away  and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free. It's a brilliant idea. It's a bee that  yes  flies. Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been. And if you're wondering  no  there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing. Although  to be sure  the reputation system  at the moment  works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience  so there may be some selection bias there. So  my urging  my thought  is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information. It's not a noun. It's a verb. And when you go on it  if you listen and see carefully and closely enough  what you will discover is that that information is saying something to you. What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday  Demosthenes was saying to us. It's saying   Let's march.  Thank you very much. Good morning. I think  as a grumpy Eastern European  I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me. Well  I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus  which  as some of you may know  is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy. So that's why I've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours. So  I'm graduating college and  feeling very idealistic  I decided to join the NGO which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former Soviet Union. However  to my surprise  I discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily. In fact  some of them actually survived the Internet challenge  and some got even more repressive. So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization. Now  I must tell you that this was never a very popular argument  and it's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience. It was never popular with many political leaders  especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't. That is  promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed. And I think by       this news has finally reached Britain  so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well. However  there is an underlying argument about logistics  which has driven so much of this debate. Right  So if you look at it close enough  you'll actually see that much of this is about economics. The cybertopians say  much like fax machines and Xerox machines did in the '  s  blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest  so people would inevitably rebel. To put it very simply  the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity  if you give them enough devices  democracy will inevitably follow. And to tell you the truth  I never really bought into this argument  in part because I never saw three American presidents agree on anything else in the past. But  you know  even beyond that  if you think about the logic underlying it  is something I call iPod liberalism  where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese who happens to have and love his iPod will also love liberal democracy. And again  I think this is kind of false. But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic    that we should be dropping iPods not bombs    I mean  it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book. But this is rarely a good sign. Right  So  the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology. For those of you who think that new media of the Internet could somehow help us avert genocide  should look no further than Rwanda  where in the '  s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place. But even beyond that  coming back to the Internet  what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes. Right  And they are building what I call the Spinternet. The combination of spin  on the one hand  and the Internet on the other. So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring  training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues. Right  So you may wonder  why on Earth are they doing it  Why are they engaging with cyberspace  Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places. The moment you put something critical in a blog  even if you manage to ban it immediately  it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs. So the more you block it  the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat and mouse game. So the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being  for example  a CIA agent. And  again  this is happening quite often. Just to give you an example of how it works in China  for example. There was a big case in February      called  Elude the Cat.  And for those of you who didn't know  I'll just give a little summary. So what happened is that a    year old man  a Chinese man  died in prison custody. And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek  which is  elude the cat  in Chinese slang  with other inmates and hit his head against the wall  which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers. So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments. In fact  QQ.com  which is a popular Chinese website  had        comments on this issue within hours. But then authorities did something very smart. Instead of trying to purge these comments  they instead went and reached out to the bloggers. And they basically said   Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators.  So     people applied  and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question  and thus inspect it and then blog about it. Within days the entire incident was forgotten  which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content. People would keep talking about it for weeks. And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace. This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation  and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online. We tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships  but in many cases it only strengthens them. And you may wonder why. I'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators. And first it's quite simple. Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum. They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime. So encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise  low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country  right  So from this perspective  having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great. Secondly  involving public in any decision making is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail. Because they say   Well look  we asked you  we consulted you  you voted on it. You put it on the front page of your blog. Well  great. You are the one who is to blame.  And finally  the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes  both at home and abroad. So inviting people to all sorts of public forums  having them participate in decision making  it's actually great. Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say   Well  we are having a democracy. We are having a forum.  Just to give you an example  one of the Russian regions  for example  now involves its citizens in planning its strategy up until year     . Right  So they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year     . I mean  anyone who has been to Russia would know that there was no planning in Russia for the next month. So having people involved in planning for      is not necessarily going to change anything  because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda. Just to give you an example from Iran  we all heard about the Twitter revolution that happened there  but if you look close enough  you'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational. They may have become slower  but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states. And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence. In the past it would take you weeks  if not months  to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other. Now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their Facebook page. I mean KGB  and not just KGB  used to torture in order to actually get this data. Now it's all available online. But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives  people who have grown up online. We often hear about cyber activism  how people are getting more active because of the Internet. Rarely hear about cyber hedonism  for example  how people are becoming passive. Why  Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets  while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography. That's not an option being considered too strongly. So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran  there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft. And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them. If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet  you'll see that the number of teenagers in China  for example  for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life  is three times more than in the United States. So it does play a social role  however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement. So the way I tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber needs in space  a total rip off from Abraham Maslow. But the point here is that when we get the remote Russian village online  what will get people to the Internet is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch. It's going to be pornography   Sex and the City   or maybe watching funny videos of cats. So this is something you have to recognize. So what should we do about it  Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of iPods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals  dissidents  NGOs and then the members of civil society. Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation  there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard. So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions and actually start doing something about it. Thank you. Thank you. Two years ago  I stood on the TED stage in Arusha  Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a simple machine that changed my life. Before that time  I had never been away from my home in Malawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day  I was so nervous. My English lost  I wanted to vomit. I had never been surrounded by so many azungu  white people. There was a story I wouldn't tell you then. But well  I'm feeling good right now. I would like to share that story today. We have seven children in my family. All sisters  excepting me. This is me with my dad when I was a little boy. Before I discovered the wonders of science  I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. Like everyone else  we grew maize. One year our fortune turned very bad. In      we experienced an awful famine. Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day  at night. Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down to nothing. In Malawi  the secondary school  you have to pay school fees. Because of the hunger  I was forced to drop out of school. I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields. It was the future I couldn't accept. I felt very happy to be at the secondary school  so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. So I went to a library. I read books  science books  especially physics. I couldn't read English that well. I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them. Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation  a defense against hunger  which we were experiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn't have materials to use  so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people  including my mother  said I was crazy. I found a tractor fan  shock absorber  PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo  I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights  with switches  and even a circuit breaker  modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps water for irrigation. Queues of people start lining up at my house to charge their mobile phone. I could not get rid of them. And the reporters came too  which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before. I had never slept in a hotel. So  on stage that day in Arusha  my English lost  I said something like   I tried. And I made it.  So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans  and the poor who are struggling with your dreams. God bless. Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet. I say to you  trust yourself and believe. Whatever happens  don't give up. Thank you. Okay  so    percent of my photographic process is  in fact  not photographic. It involves a campaign of letter writing  research and phone calls to access my subjects  which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia. And oddly  the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World  a seemingly innocuous site. And it read    I'm just going to read a key sentence   Especially during these violent times  I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to.  Photography threatens fantasy. They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities  myths and beliefs  and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth. But there are multiple truths attached to every image  depending on the creator's intention  the viewer and the context in which it is presented. Over a five year period following September   th  when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders  most notably weapons of mass destruction  I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation  mythology and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen  self imposed and real  and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge. It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information. And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes  but what I came away with is a photograph. And it's just another place from which to observe  and the understanding that there are no absolute  all knowing insiders. And the outsider can never really reach the core. I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series. It's titled   An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar   and it's comprised of nearly    images. In this context I'll just show you a few. This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State  where there are over       stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water. A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly. And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America  which you can see here. And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text. So I create these two poles. Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text. And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image  and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. So  at best  the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy. And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground. But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts. This is a cryopreservation unit  and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger  who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health  with advancements in science and technology  all for the cost of    thousand dollars  for forever. This is a    year old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty. Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state  allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen  allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse  to simulate the loss of virginity. This is a jury simulation deliberation room  and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror. And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. This process costs        dollars. This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room  a contraband room  at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On that table you can see    hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States. There is a pig's head and African cane rats. And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. I do take certain liberties and intervene. And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting  so I spent some time with the smells and items. This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley  Virginia  their original headquarters building. And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts. And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro American thoughts and aesthetics. And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency  and had thus come under question  is abstract expressionism. This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility  and on a six acre plot there are approximately    cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition. And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene. This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States. It's a research crop marijuana grow room. And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things    they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security    and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed. These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean  connecting North America to Europe. They carry over    million simultaneous voice conversations  and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. But stuff did feel like it could have been taken    or    years ago  like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed. This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired  and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. And Playboy is always in the top few. But you'd be surprised  they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a    day quarantine  where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead. And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air delivered weaponry coming from the United States. And the film was shot on    millimeter  government issue film. And that red dot is a marking on the government issue film. All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding    that would be mother to son  father to daughter  sister to brother    to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger. Meaning white fur  ice blue eyes  a pink nose. And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth. It's a very violent process that is little known. And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment. Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood. He has since passed away  but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities. This  on a lighter note  is at George Lucas' personal archive. This is the Death Star. And it's shown here in its true orientation. In the context of  Star Wars  Return of the Jedi   its mirror image is presented. They flip the negative. And you can see the photoetched brass detailing  and the painted acrylic facade. In the context of the film  this is a deep space battle station of the Galactic Empire  capable of annihilating planets and civilizations  and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat  and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. It's called the World Church of God. It's supposed to be a generic site of worship. And after I took this photograph  they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice. And we put that wall around the World Church of God  and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. And I put them into my photograph. This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School  who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity. And Alhurra is a U.S. Government  sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over    countries in the Arab world. It runs    hours a day  commercial free. However  it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States. And in       they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq  which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq. Now I'm going to move on to another project I did. It's titled  The Innocents.  And for the men in these photographs  photography had been used to create a fantasy. Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth  in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit  violent crimes. I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction  and its influence on memory  which can lead to severe  even lethal consequences. For the men in these photographs  the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. But through exposure to composite sketches  Polaroids  mug shots and line ups  eyewitness testimony can change. I'll give you an example from a case. A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker. She saw some similarities in one of the photographs  but couldn't quite make a positive identification. Days later  she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs  except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array. And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory  if there ever was an actual memory. Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals  and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications. Frederick Daye  who is photographed at his alibi location  where    witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. He was convicted by an all white jury of rape  kidnapping and vehicle theft. And he served    years of a life sentence. Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph. Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping  rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served    years of a death sentence. I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho. And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. The scene of arrest  the scene of misidentification  the alibi location. And here  the scene of the crime  it's this place to which he's never been  but changed his life forever. So photographing there  I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction  in both his life and in photography. Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. He served    years of a life sentence in Waco  Texas. Larry Mayes  I photographed at the scene of arrest  where he hid between two mattresses in Gary  Indiana  in this very room to hide from the police. He ended up serving    and a half years of an    year sentence for rape and robbery. The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification  days later  from a photo array. Larry Youngblood served eight years of a    and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a    year old boy at a carnival. He is photographed at his alibi location. Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club  and served    years of a death sentence. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. And the state's key witness in Ron's case was  in the end  the actual perpetrator. Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a    year old woman. I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago. William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary. He served seven years of a    year sentence in Kentucky. Timothy Durham  who I photographed at his alibi location where    witnesses placed him at the time of the crime  was convicted of  .  years of a      year sentence  for several charges of rape and robbery. He had been misidentified by an    year old victim. Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. He was convicted of rape  kidnapping and robbery  and served seven years of a    year sentence. Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward  but said he looked too old. The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier  which they entered into a photo array days later  and he was positively identified. Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. And it reiterates that distortion is a constant  and our eyes are easily deceived. That's it. Thank you. Clearly  we're living in a moment of crisis. Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us  and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources  the skills  and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world  with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen  who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower  but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. And by definition  every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul  a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in  you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of  even in their most ordinariness. Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty  how best we release their energies. On the one hand  we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital. The critics point to the     billion dollars spent in Africa since      and say  and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty  rampant corruption  They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable  focus on the capital markets  invest  don't give anything away. On the other side  as I said  there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich  we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid  but when it comes to our poor brethren  we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid  the eradication of smallpox  and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic  they're not listening to poor people themselves. After    years of working on issues of poverty and innovation  it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people. They must navigate markets daily  making micro decisions  dozens and dozens  to move their way through society  and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family  they could be put back into poverty  sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid. Patient capital works between  and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare  water  housing  alternative energy  thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity  but as individual customers  consumers  clients  people who want to make decisions in their own lives. Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk  a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment  to use the market as the best listening device that we have  and the expectation of below market returns  but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation  and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people. Now  entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First  they tend to work in markets where people make one  two  three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second  the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure    no roads to speak of  sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third  they are often creating markets. Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages  it is something new. And so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time  takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems  the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way  but to connect those business to other markets  to governments  to corporations    real partnerships if we want to get to scale. I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In      I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India  who'd been working for    years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether  despite the fact that     million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms  or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use  rather than that the farmers wanted to use. At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers  because these systems were both too expensive  and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less. And so  Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves  because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles. The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre  even if he had two  because it was too frightening  given all that he had at stake. Second  it had to be extremely affordable. In other words  that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest  or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third  it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre  the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth. As of today  IDE India  Amitabha's organization  has sold over         farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average  but this didn't happen overnight. In fact  when you go back to the beginning  there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day  that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors  agriculture. And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research  to experiment  to fail  to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers  that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company  for profit  that would build on IDE's knowledge  and start looking at sales and exports  and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. Secondarily  we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while  again  you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan  just to get the permits  over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono  who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert  which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started  our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions. But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha  Tanzania  A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us  with UNICEF  with the Global Fund  to create a factory that now employs       people  mostly women. And they produce    million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world. Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality  affordable maternal health care to low income women  and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every    days. And      Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry  building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth  a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access  and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder  and are now beginning to scale  because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their     ambulances  and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India. This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets  government itself  or partner with major corporations  there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation. President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country  and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations  not only for their country  but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance  but also management assistance. And then measure the returns  both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective. When we think about new approaches to aid  it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and  in all fairness  the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund  we could use this time to invest not directly in government  though we would have government's blessing  nor in international experts  but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country. People like Rashani Zafar  who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country  and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui  who developed a way called incremental housing  where he has moved        slum dwellers into safe  affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban. I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now  and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population  and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature. President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the    percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day  provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan  while we need to strengthen the judiciary  build greater stability  we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world. On one of my last visits to Pakistan  I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about     degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape like landscape with very little color  lots of heat  very little discussion  because we were exhausted. And finally  at the end of the journey  I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer  its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja  and he had kind  twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father. And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his    children and    grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about    cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations  his children would go to school. We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said   Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.  When we think about solutions to poverty  we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day  dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts. Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental  and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried  and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need  as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us  and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet. The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions  a cross sector  is now. I can only talk from my own experience  but in eight years of running Acumen fund  I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking  but to truly build systems that have created more than        jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work. And so I urge you  in whatever sector you work  in whatever job you do  to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability  with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you. Do we live in a borderless world  Before you answer that  have a look at this map. Contemporary political map shows that we have over     countries in the world today. That's probably more than at any time in centuries. Now  many of you will object. For you this would be a more appropriate map. You could call it TEDistan. In TEDistan  there are no borders  just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. Most of you probably reside in one of the    dots on this screen  of the many more that represent    percent of the world economy. But let's talk about the    percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born. For them  nations  countries  boundaries  borders still matter a great deal  and often violently. Now here at TED  we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved  our basic political geography. How do we distribute ourselves around the world  Now this is important  because border conflicts justify so much of the world's military industrial complex. Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people  money  power  religion  culture  technology interact to change the map of the world. And we can try to anticipate those changes  and shape them in a more constructive direction. So we're going to look at some maps of the past  the present and some maps you haven't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going. Let's start with the world of     .      there were just     countries in the world. After World War II  Europe was devastated  but still held large overseas colonies  French West Africa  British East Africa  South Asia  and so forth. Then over the late '  s  '  s  '  s  '  s and '  s  waves of decolonization took place. Over    new countries were born. You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  South East Asian nations created. Then came the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe  the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans  and the 'stans of central Asia. Today we have     countries in the world. The entire planet is covered by sovereign  independent nation states. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss  Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world  Eastern Eurasia. As you can see on this map  Russia is still the largest country in the world. And as you know  China is the most populous. And they share a lengthy land border. What you don't see on this map is that most of Russia's     million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to Europe. And only    million people are in its eastern areas. In fact  the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about     million people And there is another thing that you don't see on this map. Stalin  Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags  labor camps  nuclear cities  whatever the case was. But as oil prices rose  Russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country  east and west. But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution  because the people in the east  who never wanted to be there anyway  have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west. As a result  in the Russian far east today  which is twice the size of India  you have exactly six million Russians. So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world. We can start with Mongolia  or as some call it  Mine golia. Why do they call it that  Because in Mine golia  Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines    copper  zinc  gold    and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. China isn't conquering Mongolia. It's buying it. Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought. So let's apply this principle to Siberia. Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold  desolate  unlivable place. But in fact  with global warming and rising temperatures  all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness  and grain being produced in Siberia. But who is it going to feed  Well  just on the other side of the Amo River  in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China  you have over     million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia. Every single year  for at least a decade or more           of them have been voting with their feet  crossing  moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain. They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics. They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east  back into China. Again  like Mongolia  China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. That's what I call globalization Chinese style. Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in    to    years. But hold on. This map is     years old. This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty  led by Kublai Khan  the grandson of Genghis Khan. So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself  but it does rhyme. This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. Again  globalization Chinese style. Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. So  the history of East Asia in fact  people don't think about nations and borders. They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies  usually Chinese or Japanese. Well it's China's turn again. So let's look at how China is re establishing that hierarchy in the far East. It starts with the global hubs. Remember the    dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy  East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Tokyo  Seoul  Beijing  Shanghai  Hong Kong  Singapore and Sidney. These are the filters and funnels of global capital. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region  so much of it being invested into China. Then there is trade. These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region. Specifically  it targets Japan and Korea and Australia  countries that are strong allies of the United States. Australia  for example  is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. For poorer countries  China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well. And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound  the economic rebound  not just in Asia  but potentially for the world. The Asian free trade zone  almost free trade zone  that's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific. So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region. Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy. China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries  such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States  most countries vow to just sit it out  including American allies like Korea and Australia. Another pillar of the strategy  like Russia  is demographic. China exports business people  nannies  students  teachers to teach Chinese around the region  to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia  Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there. Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result. Singapore  for example  used to ban Chinese language education. Now it encourages it. If you add it all up what do you get  Well  if you remember before World War II  Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co prosperity sphere. What's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co prosperity sphere. So no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders  what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures  but in a much more fluid  imperial zone. All of this is happening without firing a shot. That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world  What lines on the map should we focus on  What I want to present to you is what I call state building  day by day. Let's start with Iraq. Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq  the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality. Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together  now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration. The reason is Kurdistan. The Kurds for       years have been waging a struggle for independence  and now is their chance to finally have it. These are pipeline routes  which emerge from Kurdistan  which is an oil rich region. And today  if you go to Kurdistan  you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army. But what are they guarding  Is it really a border on the map  No. It's the pipelines. If the Kurds can control their pipelines  they can set the terms of their own statehood. Now should we be upset about this  about the potential disintegration of Iraq  I don't believe we should. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world  behind Saudi Arabia. And we'll have a chance to solve a       year old dispute. Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked. It has no choice but to behave. In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria  and other countries  and Iraq itself. And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them. Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region. That is  of course  in Palestine. Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it's two parts Palestinian  one part Israel.    years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict. What might  I believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure. Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this. These two arrows are an arc  an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the West Bank and Gaza. If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank  you can have a viable Palestinian state  Palestinian economy. That  I believe  is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone  without infrastructure  is futile. Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders  when the insecurities might abate  The last time that was the case was actually a century ago  during the Ottoman Empire. This is the Hejaz Railway. The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel  on the Mediterranean Sea. But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters  ruins. If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map  infrastructure  that cross the straight lines  the borders  I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region. Now let's look at another part of the world  the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia  the 'stans. These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. Fortunately for them  most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed. Now I know some of you may be thinking   Oil  oil  oil. Why is it all he's talking about is oil   Well  there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. Before it was  how do we control their oil  Now it's their oil for their own purposes. And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. A great deal of them. For a number of countries in this part of the world  having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves. Just take Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses  but now with the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey  it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west. Then there is Turkmenistan  which most people think of as a frozen basket case. But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe  and even a potentially Turkmen  Afghan Pakistan India pipeline as well. Then there is Kazakhstan  which didn't even have a name before. It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. Today most people recognize Kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player. Why  Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian  north through Russia  and even east to China. More pipelines means more silk roads  instead of the Great Game. The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust. The more pipelines we have  the more silk roads we'll have  and the less of a dominant Great Game competition we'll have in the   st century. Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders  and how that has enhanced its strength. And that is  of course  Europe. The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries  and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. But then eventually it grew into    countries  and those are the    stars on the European flag. The E.U. also became a currency block  and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. On average  the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. In fact most of that happened on just one day. In          new countries joined the E.U. and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning    countries and     million people. So what is next  What is the future of the European Union  Well in light blue  you see the zones or the regions that are at least two thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. What does that tell us  Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.  they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. Just take the Balkans. Croatia  Serbia Bosnia  they're not members of the E.U. yet. But you can get on a German ICE train and make it almost to Albania. In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already  and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have. So  looking at other parts of Europe's periphery  such as North Africa. On average  every year or two  a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean  connecting North Africa to Europe. That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance on Russia for energy  but if you travel to North Africa today  you'll hear more and more people saying that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East. So in other words  I believe that President Sarkozy of France is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union. Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. I mentioned Azerbaijan before. That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for    percent of Europe's energy supply. So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union  I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro Turkish superpower. So what's next  Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born  Well  South Central Asia  South West Asia is a very good place to start. Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of Pashtun nationalism. This is the flag that flies in the minds of    million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border. Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south  Balochistan. Two weeks ago  Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison  and this was the flag that they raised over it. The post colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating  and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment. Of course  we can't forget Africa.    countries  and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more  tribal divisions and so forth. But let's just look at Sudan  the second largest country in Africa. It has three ongoing civil wars  the genocide in Darfur  which you all know about  the civil war in the east of the country  and south Sudan. South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in      in which it is very likely to vote itself independence. Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle. There is a great race on for energy resources under the Arctic seabed. Who will win  Canada  Russia  The United States  Actually Greenland. Several weeks ago Greenland's          people voted themselves self governance rights from Denmark. So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller. What is the lesson from all of this  Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. It's constantly morphing and changing the world  like climate change. And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet. Now we fear changes on the map. We fear civil wars  death tolls  having to learn the names of new countries. But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent. The question is how do we change those borders  and what lines do we focus on  I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders  the infrastructure lines. Then we'll wind up with the world we want  a borderless one. Thank you. I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do  something like    years ago. It's a woodworking machine  or at least a piece of one  and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern  a little bit easier to use. I thought  at the time  I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately  not very long afterwards the company went out of business. This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again     months later  the product was obsolete. And now  of course  the whole technology is obsolete. Now  I'm a fairly slow learner  but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important    making things more attractive  making them a bit easier to use  making them more marketable. By focusing on a design  maybe just a single product  I was being incremental and not having much of an impact. But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon  and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the   th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today  and particularly when we read about it in the popular press  we're often talking about products like these. Amusing  Yes. Desirable  Maybe. Important  Not so very. But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design  and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach  that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman  Isambard Kingdom Brunel  designed many great things in his career in the   th century  including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway. And as a kid I grew up very close to here  and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting   Rain  Steam and Speed . Now  what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside. Now  this was back in the   th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made  which meant building long viaducts across river valleys    this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead    and long tunnels such as the one at Box  in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey. Now  Brunel was working     years before the emergence of the design profession  but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world changing innovations. Now  design thinking begins with what Roger Martin  the business school professor at the University of Toronto  calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design  that means balancing desirability  what humans need  with technical feasibility  and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western  we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit. So somehow  we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world  to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured  so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics  image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood  and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems    to global warming  to education  healthcare  security  clean water  whatever. And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems  there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human centered. It may integrate technology and economics  but it starts with what humans need  or might need. What makes life easier  more enjoyable  What makes technology useful and usable  But that is more than simply good ergonomics  putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas. So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India  they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality  ultra low cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now  in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India  those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service. Instead of starting with technology  the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start  then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build  building in order to think. Now  prototypes speed up the process of innovation  because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that  the faster our ideas evolve. Now  much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai  India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross subsidize those who cannot. Now  they are very efficient  but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago  what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early. This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from      a pair  down to just    a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory  they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large scale machines used by western producers  they used low cost CAD CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory. So if human need is the place to start  and prototyping  a vehicle for progress  then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption  design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation    the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful  productive and profitable. So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about  this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things  and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems  in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured  is going to be the major theme  not only for design  but also for our economy as we go forward. So William Beveridge  when he wrote the first of his famous reports in       created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being. By the time he wrote his third report  he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers. Hilary Cottam  Charlie Leadbeater  and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation  and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge  .   they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle  they worked with residents in Southwark  South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with     older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year. We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience  and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research  brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping  they've developed a completely new way to change shift. They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients  to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients  using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from    minutes to    minutes  on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in    hospitals in the system  it resulted  actually  in a pretty big impact. And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here  and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now  and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives  new ideas. Now  Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution  when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course  and indeed they are part of the problem today. But  again  we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society    how we keep ourselves healthy  how we govern ourselves  how we educate ourselves  how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change  we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete. So why design thinking  Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives  it encourages us to take a divergent approach  to explore new alternatives  new solutions  new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence  there is actually quite an important first step. And that is  what is the question that we're trying to answer  What's the design brief  Now Brunel may have asked a question like this   How do I take a train from London to New York   But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today  So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular  is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund  in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people  and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers  So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate  we took a sort of more open  collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with    water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products  services  and business models. We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns  community outreach strategies  business models  new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa. So for me  this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly  by getting the process out of the hands of designers  and by getting the active participation of the community  we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel  by focusing on systems  we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on. I'm actually really quite interested  and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle  And if you've got any ideas then feel free  you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use   CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code. So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference  that it can help create new ideas and new innovations  beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design  more like Brunel  less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much. For years I've been feeling frustrated  because as a religious historian  I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. Sometimes it comes in a positive version     Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.  And equally important is the negative version     Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.  Look into your own heart  discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse  under any circumstance whatsoever  to inflict that pain on anybody else. And people have emphasized the importance of compassion  not just because it sounds good  but because it works. People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said   all day and every day   not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism  but to do it all day and every day  you dethrone yourself from the center of your world  put another there  and you transcend yourself. And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God  Nirvana  Rama  Tao. Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego bound existence. But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time  that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions  very often when religious people come together  religious leaders come together  they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort. Often people don't really want to be compassionate. I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. And that of course defeats the object of the exercise. Now why was I so grateful to TED  Because they took me very gently from my book lined study and brought me into the   st century  enabling me to speak to a much  much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. Because I feel an urgency about this. If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally  so that we treat all peoples  wherever and whoever they may be  as though they were as important as ourselves  I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation. The task of our time  one of the great tasks of our time  is to build a global society  as I said  where people can live together in peace. And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. This is the source of all morality  this imaginative act of empathy  putting yourself in the place of another. And so we have a choice  it seems to me. We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith  or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel  the older contemporary of Jesus  who  when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg  said   That which is hateful to you  do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.  And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. And we need to revive that spirit. And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. We have to make this happen  and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners. In Singapore  we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society  and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. In Malaysia  there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people  young people  and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. Throughout Europe  the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions  are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths. But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch. Religious teaching  this is where we've gone so wrong  concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines. Religious teaching must always lead to action. And I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to do two things    educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. You also have to do it. I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people  which are dividing us from one another. The same applies to educators. I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism  the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle. And also see that it demands acute intelligence  not just a gooey feeling. I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all  to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking  so that because people have this Charter  whatever their beliefs or lack of them  they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech  disdainful remarks from their religious leaders  their political leaders  from the captains of industry. Because we can change the world  we have the ability. I would never have thought of putting the Charter online. I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. Because that is what is so wonderful about TED. In this room  all this expertise  if we joined it all together  we could change the world. And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable. But I'd just like to quote  finish at the end with a reference to a British author  an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often  C.S. Lewis. But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. It's in his book  The Four Loves.  He said that he distinguished between erotic love  when two people gaze  spellbound  into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship  when two people stand side by side  as it were  shoulder to shoulder  with their eyes fixed on a common goal. We don't have to fall in love with each other  but we can become friends. And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey  that when people of all different persuasions come together  working side by side for a common goal  differences melt away. And we learn amity. And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. Thank you very much.
