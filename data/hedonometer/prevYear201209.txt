Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things. I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self assembling  replicating and repairing themselves. So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing  and then compare that to some natural systems. So in the current state of manufacturing  we have skyscrapers    two and a half years  of assembly time           to a million parts  fairly complex  new  exciting technologies in steel  concrete  glass. We have exciting machines that can take us into space    five years  of assembly time    .  million parts. But on the other side  if you look at the natural systems  we have proteins that have two million types  can fold in        nanoseconds  or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour. So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems  but they're extremely efficient  far more efficient than anything we can build  far more complex than anything we can build. They're far more efficient in terms of energy. They hardly ever make mistakes. And they can repair themselves for longevity. So there's something super interesting about natural systems. And if we can translate that into our built environment  then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things. And I think the key to that is self assembly. So if we want to utilize self assembly in our physical environment  I think there's four key factors. The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build    so our buildings and machines. And we need to decode that into simple sequences    basically the DNA of how our buildings work. Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up  or reconfigure. We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate  allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program. And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self assembling future. The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot. So these projects are large scale reconfigurable robots      ft.     ft. long proteins. They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices  sensors. You decode what you want to fold up into  into a sequence of angles    so negative      negative                 negative        something like that  so a sequence of angles  or turns  and you send that sequence through the string. Each unit takes its message    so negative        it rotates to that  checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor. So these are the brilliant scientists  engineers  designers that worked on this project. And I think it really brings to light  Is this really scalable  I mean  thousands of dollars  lots of man hours made to make this eight foot robot. Can we really scale this up  Can we really embed robotics into every part  The next one questions that and looks at passive nature  or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability. But it goes a step further  and it tries to have actual computation. It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing  the digital logic gate  directly into your parts. So this is a NAND gate. You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing  and you have two input tetrahedrons. One of them is the input from the user  as you're building your bricks. The other one is from the previous brick that was placed. And then it gives you an output in  D space. So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do. It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do. And now it starts moving in three dimensional space    so up or down. So on the left hand side        input equals   output  which goes down. On the right hand side        input is a   output  which goes up. And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build. So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed. So that means that we can have some form of self replication. In this case I call it self guided replication  because your structure contains the exact blueprints. If you have errors  you can replace a part. All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it. So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one. It's directly embedded  there's no external instructions. So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains  and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self assembly systems. So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system. So basically you have a chain of elements. Each element is completely identical  and they're biased. So each chain  or each element  wants to turn right or left. So as you assemble the chain  you're basically programming it. You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left. So when you shake the chain  it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in    so in this case  a spiral  or in this case  two cubes next to each other. So you can basically program any three dimensional shape    or one dimensional  two dimensional    up into this chain completely passively. So what does this tell us about the future  I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self assembly  replication  repair in our physical structures  our buildings  machines. There's new programmability in these parts. And from that you have new possibilities for computing. We'll have spatial computing. Imagine if our buildings  our bridges  machines  all of our bricks could actually compute. That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power  new design possibilities. So it's exciting potential for this. So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future  if we implement these new technologies for a new self assembling world. Thank you. I want to address the issue of compassion. Compassion has many faces. Some of them are fierce  some of them are wrathful  some of them are tender  some of them are wise. A line that the Dalai Lama once said  he said   Love and compassion are necessities. They are not luxuries. Without them  humanity cannot survive.  And I would suggest  it is not only humanity that won't survive  but it is all species on the planet  as we've heard today. It is the big cats  and it's the plankton. Two weeks ago  I was in Bangalore in India. I was so privileged to be able to teach in a hospice on the outskirts of Bangalore. And early in the morning  I went into the ward. In that hospice  there were    men and women who were actively dying. And I walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly  fragile  obviously in the latter phase of active dying. I looked into her face. I looked into the face of her son sitting next to her  and his face was just riven with grief and confusion. And I remembered a line from the Mahabharata  the great Indian epic   What is the most wondrous thing in the world  Yudhisthira   And Yudhisthira replied   The most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don't realize it can happen to us.  I looked up. Tending those    dying people were young women from villages around Bangalore. I looked into the face of one of these women  and I saw in her face the strength that arises when natural compassion is really present. I watched her hands as she bathed an old man. My gaze went to another young woman as she wiped the face of another dying person. And it reminded me of something that I had just been present for. Every year or so  I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever. And on the first day at Simikot in Humla  far west of Nepal  the most impoverished region of Nepal  an old man came in clutching a bundle of rags. And he walked in  and somebody said something to him  we realized he was deaf  and we looked into the rags  and there was this pair of eyes. The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned. Again  the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara. It was the young women  the health aids  who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds. I know those hands and eyes  they touched me as well. They touched me at that time. They have touched me throughout my    years. They touched me when I was four and I lost my eyesight and was partially paralyzed. And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me. And that woman did not have sentimental compassion. She had phenomenal strength. And it was really her strength  I believe  that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life. So we can ask  What is compassion comprised of  And there are various facets. And there's referential and non referential compassion. But first  compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering. It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering. But that is not enough  because compassion  which activates the motor cortex  means that we aspire  we actually aspire to transform suffering. And if we're so blessed  we engage in activities that transform suffering. But compassion has another component  and that component is really essential. That component is that we cannot be attached to outcome. Now I worked with dying people for over    years. I had the privilege of working on death row in a maximum security  prison  for six years. And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience  from working with dying people and training caregivers  that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe. And when I worked in the prison system  it was so clear to me  this  that many of us in this room  and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row  the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered. That compassion is actually an inherent human quality. It is there within every human being. But the conditions for compassion to be activated  to be aroused  are particular conditions. I had that condition  to a certain extent  from my own childhood illness. Eve Ensler  whom you'll hear later  has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through. And what is fascinating is that compassion has enemies  and those enemies are things like pity  moral outrage  fear. And you know  we have a society  a world  that is paralyzed by fear. And in that paralysis  of course  our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed. The very word terror is global. The very feeling of terror is global. So our work  in a certain way  is to address this imago  this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe. Now we know from neuroscience that compassion has some very extraordinary qualities. For example  A person who is cultivating compassion  when they are in the presence of suffering  they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do. However  they return to baseline a lot sooner. This is called resilience. Many of us think that compassion drains us  but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us. Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration. It hooks up all parts of the brain. Another  which has been discovered by various researchers at Emory and at Davis and so on  is that compassion enhances our immune system. Hey  we live in a very noxious world. Most of us are shrinking in the face of psycho social and physical poisons  of the toxins of our world. But compassion  the generation of compassion  actually mobilizes our immunity. You know  if compassion is so good for us  I have a question. Why don't we train our children in compassion  If compassion is so good for us  why don't we train our health care providers in compassion so that they can do what they're supposed to do  which is to really transform suffering  And if compassion is so good for us  why don't we vote on compassion  Why don't we vote for people in our government based on compassion  so that we can have a more caring world  In Buddhism  we say   it takes a strong back and a soft front.  It takes tremendous strength of the back to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions. And that is the mental quality of equanimity. But it also takes a soft front    the capacity to really be open to the world as it is  to have an undefended heart. And the archetype of this in Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara  Kuan Yin. It's a female archetype  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. She stands with        arms  and in every hand  there is an instrument of liberation  and in the palm of every hand  there are eyes  and these are the eyes of wisdom. I say that  for thousands of years  women have lived  exemplified  met in intimacy  the archetype of Avalokitesvara  of Kuan Yin  she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world. Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered  unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is. They have infused societies with kindness  and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half. And they have actualized compassion through direct action. Jody Williams called it  It's good to meditate. I'm sorry  you've got to do a little bit of that  Jody. Step back  give your mother a break  okay. But the other side of the equation is you've got to come out of your cave. You have to come into the world like Asanga did  who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha after    years sitting in the cave. He said   I'm out of here.  He's going down the path. He sees something in the path. He looks  it's a dog  he drops to his knees. He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg. The wound is just filled with maggots. He puts out his tongue in order to remove the maggots  so as not to harm them. And at that moment  the dog transformed into the Buddha of love and kindness. I believe that women and girls today have to partner in a powerful way with men    with their fathers  with their sons  with their brothers  with the plumbers  the road builders  the caregivers  the doctors  the lawyers  with our president  and with all beings. The women in this room are lotuses in a sea of fire. May we actualize that capacity for women everywhere. Thank you. I didn't always love unintended consequences  but I've really learned to appreciate them. I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress  even when they seem to be terrible. And I'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do. Let's go to        years before the present  to the time of the cultural explosion  when music  art  technology  so many of the things that we're enjoying today  so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born. And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation  that if our ancestors        years ago had been able to see what they had done  they wouldn't have really understood it. They were responding to immediate concerns. They were making it possible for us to do what they do  and yet  they didn't really understand how they did it. Now let's advance to        years before the present. And this is when it really gets interesting. What about the domestication of grains  What about the origins of agriculture  What would our ancestors        years ago have said if they really had technology assessment  And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity  at least in the next few hundred years. It was really bad news. First of all  worse nutrition  maybe shorter life spans. It was simply awful for women. The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning  noon and night. And politically  it was awful. It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people. If there had been rational technology assessment then  I think they very well might have said   Let's call the whole thing off.  Even now  our choices are having unintended effects. Historically  for example  chopsticks    according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan    resulted in long term changes in the dentition  in the teeth  of the Japanese public. And we are also changing our teeth right now. There is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time. That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence. But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal  there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have. So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand. In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences  and there was a very healthy sense of caution  reflected in the Tree of Knowledge  in Pandora's Box  and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology. And that's all very true. The physicians of the ancient world    especially the Egyptians  who started medicine as we know it    were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat. And the translations of the surviving texts say   This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.  They were very conscious. So were the followers of Hippocrates. The Hippocratic manuscripts also    repeatedly  according to recent studies    show how important it is not to do harm. More recently  Harvey Cushing  who really developed neurosurgery as we know it  who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook  he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing. But he did his best  and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine. Now if we look forward a bit to the   th century  we find a new style of technology. What we find is  no longer simple tools  but systems. We find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on. And the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid   th century  who were the original hackers. Thomas Edison would have been very  very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today. And these hackers had a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that they called bugs. That was the origin of the word  bug.  This consciousness  though  was a little slow to seep through the general population  even people who were very  very well informed. Samuel Clemens  Mark Twain  was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times    at least until         registered with the U.S. Patent Office. That was the Paige typesetter. The Paige typesetter had        parts. The patent had    pages of text and     figures. It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type    including returning the type to its place  which was a very difficult thing. And Mark Twain  who knew all about typesetting  really was smitten by this machine. Unfortunately  he was smitten in more ways than one  because it made him bankrupt  and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money. And this was an important thing about   th century technology  that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart  even when judged by the most expert people. Now there is something else  though  in the early   th century that made things even more complicated. And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger. The lesson of the Titanic  for a lot of the contemporaries  was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship. And this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them. However  there was another case  the Eastland  a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in       and it killed     people    that was    more than the passenger toll of the Titanic. The reason for it  in part  was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable. And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences  it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw. It's really a question of the system  how the ship was loaded  the ballast and many other things. So the   th century  then  saw how much more complex reality was  but it also saw a positive side. It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies. It could benefit from tragedies. And my favorite example of that    which is not really widely known as a technological miracle  but it may be one of the greatest of all times  was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War. Penicillin was discovered in       but even by       no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced. A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it. They were working on it independently  and they weren't getting anywhere. And the Government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done. And not only did they do it  but within two years  they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one liter flasks to        gallon vats. That was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time. In the Second World War  too  the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain. So there were benefits in calamities    benefits to pure science  as well as to applied science and medicine. Now when we come to the period after the Second World War  unintended consequences get even more interesting. And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in       when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters  but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus. Well  technology to the rescue. So chemists got to work  and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems. But something else happened in the early     s  and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States. And IBM  which made them  just didn't know what to do. They commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate  and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts. What happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin. And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads. So they reformulated the bactericide. But what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering  at least indirectly  from a human disease. So it shows that we're really all in this together. In fact  it also shows something interesting  that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically  unfortunately  our ability to model their long term behavior  which has also been increasing  has been increasing only arithmetically. So one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight. One other very positive consequence of   th century technology  though  was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances. There are two historians of business at the University of Maryland  Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch  who have done some extremely interesting work  much of it still unpublished  on the history of major innovations. They have combined the list of major innovations  and they've discovered that the greatest number  the greatest decade  for fundamental innovations  as reflected in all of the lists that others have made    a number of lists that they have merged    was the Great Depression. And nobody knows just why this was so  but one story can reflect something of it. It was the origin of the Xerox copier  which celebrated its   th anniversary last year. And Chester Carlson  the inventor  was a patent attorney. He really was not intending to work in patent research  but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job. So this was the best job he could get. He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions  and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying  which he patented in the late     s    and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in     . So we see that sometimes  as a result of these dislocations  as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference  that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity. What does this mean  It means  I think  that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities. Think of the financial world  for example. The mentor of Warren Buffett  Benjamin Graham  developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the      crash. And he published that book in the early     s  and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook. So many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters. Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now    bed bugs  killer bees  spam    and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question. If we think  for example  of Louis Pasteur  who in the     s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry  and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease. So very often  some kind of disaster    sometimes the consequence  for example  of over cultivation of silk worms  which was a problem in Europe at the time    can be the key to something much bigger. So this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences. We need to take a really positive view. We need to see what they can do for us. We need to learn from those figures that I mentioned. We need to learn  for example  from Dr. Cushing  who killed patients in the course of his early operations. He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes. And he learned meticulously from his mistakes. And as a result  when we say   This isn't brain surgery   that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects. And we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge  to share their knowledge  in the face of an emergency  which they hadn't really been for years and years. They might have been able to do it earlier. The message  then  for me  about unintended consequences is chaos happens  let's make better use of it. Thank you very much. I am the daughter of a forger  not just any forger ... When you hear the word  forger   you often understand  mercenary.  You understand  forged currency    forged pictures.  My father is no such man. For    years of his life  he made false papers    never for himself  always for other people  and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed. Let me introduce him. Here is my father at age   . It all began for him during World War II  when at age    he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop. He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance. And it's not a banal story    after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '  s. When I was a child I knew nothing about this  of course. This is me in the middle making faces. I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children. I had a  normal  dad like everybody else  apart from the fact that he was    years older than ... well  he was basically old enough to be my grandfather. Anyway  he was a photographer and a street educator  and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly. And  of course  he never talked about his past life when he was a forger. There was  however  an incident I'm going to tell you about  that perhaps could have led me suspect something. I was in high school and got a bad grade  a rare event for me  so I decided to hide it from my parents. In order to do that  I set out to forge their signature. I started working on my mother's signature  because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge. So  I got working. I took some sheets of paper and started practicing  practicing  practicing  until I reached what I thought was a steady hand  and went into action. Later  while checking my school bag  my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged. She yelled at me like she never had before. I went to hide in my bedroom  under the blankets  and then I waited for my father to come back from work with  one could say  much apprehension. I heard him come in. I remained under the blankets. He entered my room  sat on the corner of the bed  and he was silent  so I pulled the blanket from my head  and when he saw me he started laughing. He was laughing so hard  he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand. Then he said   But really  Sarah  you could have worked harder  Can't you see it's really too small   Indeed  it's rather small. I was born in Algeria. There I would hear people say my father was a  moudjahid  and that means  fighter.  Later on  in France  I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations  and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life  especially that he had  done  World War II  that he had  done  the Algerian war. And in my head I would be thinking that  doing  a war meant being a soldier. But knowing my father  and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non violent  I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun. And indeed  I was very far from the mark. One day  while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality  I happened to see some documents that caught my attention. These are real  These are mine  I was born an Argentinean. But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services. And then  suddenly  I went  wow   My father  a secret agent  It was very James Bond. I wanted to ask him questions  which he didn't answer. And later  I told myself that one day I would have to question him. And then I became a mother and had a son  and finally decided it was time    that he absolutely had to talk to us. I had become a mother and he was celebrating his   th birthday  and suddenly I was very  very afraid. I feared he'd go and take his silences with him  and take his secrets with him. I managed to convince him that it was important for us  but possibly also for other people that he shared his story. He decided to tell it to me and I made a book  from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. So  his story. My father was born in Argentina. His parents were of Russian descent. The whole family came to settle in France in the '  s. His parents were Jewish  Russian and above all  very poor. So at the age of    my father had to work. And with his only diploma  his primary education certificate  he found himself working at a dyer   dry cleaner. That's where he discovered something totally magical  and when he talks about it  it's fascinating    it's the magic of dyeing chemistry. During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was   . This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness. All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn  to accumulate more and more knowledge  and at night  when no one was looking  he'd put his experience to practice. He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. All this to tell you that if my father became a forger  actually  it was almost by accident. His family was Jewish  so they were hounded. Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers. Well  they were out  but they were always in danger. The big  Jew  stamp was still on their papers. It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents. My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted  he'd never thought of false papers. But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. In those times documents had hard covers  they were filled in by hand  and they stated your job. In order to survive  he needed to be working. He asked the man to write  dyer.  Suddenly the man looked very  very interested. As a  dyer   do you know how to bleach ink marks  Of course he knew. And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem  even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink  called  indelible   the  Waterman  blue ink. And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it. Now  of course  the man was very impressed with this young man of    who could immediately give him the formula  so he recruited him. And actually  without knowing it  my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case  the so called  correction pen.  But it was only the beginning. That's my father. As soon as he got to the lab  even though he was the youngest  he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents. All the movements stopped at falsifying. But demand was ever growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents. He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch. He started a press. He started photoengraving. He started making rubber stamps. He started inventing all kind of things    with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel. Anyway  he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output. He had made a simple calculation  In one hour he could make    forged documents. If he slept one hour     people would die. This sense of responsibility for other people's lives when he was just       and also his guilt for being a survivor  since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not    stayed with him all his life. And this is maybe what explains why  for    years  he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices. I'd like to talk about those sacrifices  because there were many. There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid. To him  being paid would have meant being a mercenary. If he had accepted payment  he wouldn't be able to say  yes  or  no  depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause. So he was a photographer by day  and a forger by night for    years. He was broke all of the time. Then there were the emotional sacrifices  How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets  How can one explain what one does at night in the lab  every single night  Of course  there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later. One day my father introduced me to my sister. He also explained to me that I had a brother  too  and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four  and they were    years older than me. They are both in their sixties now. In order to write the book  I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was  who was the father she had known. She explained that the father that she'd had would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk. They would get all dressed up and wait for him  but he would almost never come. He'd say   I'll call.  He wouldn't call. And then he would not come. Then one day he totally disappeared. Time passed  and they thought he had surely forgotten them  at first. Then as time passed  at the end of almost two years  they thought   Well  perhaps our father has died.  And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful. And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned  orphaned  my father was making false papers. And if he did not tell them  it was of course to protect them. After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel. And then  as he was a staunch anti colonialist  he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war. After the Algerian war  at the heart of the international resistance movements  his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door. In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence  Guinea  Guinea Bissau  Angola. And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti apartheid party. He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans. There was also Latin America. My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic  Haiti  and then it was the turn of Brazil  Argentina  Venezuela  El Salvador  Nicaragua  Colombia  Peru  Uruguay  Chile and Mexico. Then there was the Vietnam War. My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese. Europe was not spared either. My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain  Salazar in Portugal  against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece  and even in France. There  just once  it happened in May of     . My father watched  benevolently  of course  the demonstrations of the month of May  but his heart was elsewhere  and so was his time because he had over    countries to serve. Once  though  he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize. He was much younger in those days  and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting. He told me that those false papers were the most media relevant and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life. But  he agreed to do it  even though Daniel Cohn Bendit's life was not in danger  just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities  and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders    and that ideas have no borders. All my childhood  while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales  my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles. And those heroes did not need an army behind them. Anyhow  nobody would have followed them  except for a handful  of  men and women of conviction and courage. I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep. I asked him whether  considering the sacrifices he had to make  he ever had any regrets. He said no. He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything. He was persuaded  and he's still convinced that another world is possible    a world where no one would ever need a forger. He's still dreaming about it. My father is here in the room today. His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up. Thank you. What I'm going to try and do in the next    minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we're going to make matter come alive. Now this may seem a bit ambitious  but when you look at yourself  you look at your hands  you realize that you're alive. So this is a start. Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth. There's been four billion years of organic  biological life. And as an inorganic chemist  my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic  living world and the inorganic  dead world. And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic  dead matter into living matter  into inorganic biology. Before we do that  I want to kind of put biology in its place. And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology. I love to do synthetic biology. I love things that are alive. I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology. But within that infrastructure  we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution. And evolution  although it was established well over     years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people  evolution still is a little bit intangible. And when I talk about Darwinian evolution  I mean one thing and one thing only  and that is survival of the fittest. And so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way. Think about evolution in terms of offspring competing  and some winning. So bearing that in mind  as a chemist  I wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology  What is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo Darwinian evolution  And this seems quite a profound question. And as a chemist  we're not used to profound questions every day. So when I thought about it  then suddenly I realized that biology gave us the answer. And in fact  the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is  in fact  a single cell    a bacteria. So this raises three really important questions  What is life  Is biology special  Biologists seem to think so. Is matter evolvable  Now if we answer those questions in reverse order  the third question    is matter evolvable     if we can answer that  then we're going to know how special biology is  and maybe  just maybe  we'll have some idea of what life really is. So here's some inorganic life. This is a dead crystal  and I'm going to do something to it  and it's going to become alive. And you can see  it's kind of pollinating  germinating  growing. This is an inorganic tube. And all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago  and they look alive. Of course  they're not alive. It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden. But when I saw this  I was really fascinated  because it seemed lifelike. And as I pause for a few seconds  have a look at the screen. You can see there's architecture growing  filling the void. And this is dead. So I was positive that  if somehow we can make things mimic life  let's go one step further. Let's see if we can actually make life. But there's a problem  because up until maybe a decade ago  we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe. In fact  we were the only people in the universe. Now  that's a bit boring. So as a chemist  I wanted to say   Hang on. What is going on here  Is life that improbable   And this is really the question. I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells was as probable as the emergence of the stars. And in fact  let's take that one step further. Let's say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe  maybe the physics of life is as well. And so the problem with chemists    and this is a massive advantage as well    is we like to focus on our elements. In biology  carbon takes center stage. And in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology  then we have all this wonderful diversity of life. In fact  we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate. We're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards. Well what about matter  If we can make matter alive  would we have a matterhazard  So think  this is a serious question. If your pen could replicate  that would be a bit of a problem. So we have to think differently if we're going to make stuff come alive. And we also have to be aware of the issues. But before we can make life  let's think for a second what life really is characterized by. And forgive the complicated diagram. This is just a collection of pathways in the cell. And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing. Synthetic biologists are manipulating it. Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease. And you have all these pathways going on at the same time. You have regulation  information is transcribed  catalysts are made  stuff is happening. But what does a cell do  Well it divides  it competes  it survives. And I think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life. But what else is life characterized by  Well  I like think of it as a flame in a bottle. And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating  metabolizing  burning through chemistries. And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life  we need to power it somehow. So before we can really start to make life  we have to really think about where it came from. And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere    maybe not in Scotland  maybe in Africa  maybe somewhere else. But the real honest answer is  we just don't know  because there is a problem with the origin. Imagine way back  four and a half billion years ago  there is a vast chemical soup of stuff. And from this stuff we came. So when you think about the improbable nature of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes  just remember  we came from stuff on planet Earth. And we went through a variety of worlds. The RNA people would talk about the RNA world. We somehow got to proteins and DNA. We then got to the last ancestor. Evolution kicked in    and that's the cool bit. And here we are. But there's a roadblock that you can't get past. You can decode the genome  you can look back  you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA  but we can't get further than the last ancestor  the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history. So we don't know how we got here. So there are two options  intelligent design  direct and indirect    so God  or my friend. Now talking about E.T. putting us there  or some other life  just pushes the problem further on. I'm not a politician  I'm a scientist. The other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity. This seems most likely. So we have some kind of primordial soup. And this one happens to be a good source of all    amino acids. And somehow these amino acids are combined  and life begins. But life begins  what does that mean  What is life  What is this stuff of life  So in the     s  Miller Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment  where they did the equivalent in the chemical world. They took the basic ingredients  put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through. And they had a look at what was in the soup  and they found amino acids  but nothing came out  there was no cell. So the whole area's been stuck for a while  and it got reignited in the '  s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on. In my own laboratory  the way we're trying to create inorganic life is by using many different reaction formats. So what we're trying to do is do reactions    not in one flask  but in tens of flasks  and connect them together  as you can see with this flow system  all these pipes. We can do it microfluidically  we can do it lithographically  we can do it in a  D printer  we can do it in droplets for colleagues. And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away. But that's probably going to end in failure  so we need to be a bit more focused. And the answer  of course  lies with mice. This is how I remember what I need as a chemist. I say   Well I want molecules.  But I need a metabolism  I need some energy. I need some information  and I need a container. Because if I want evolution  I need containers to compete. So if you have a container  it's like getting in your car.  This is my car  and I'm going to drive around and show off my car.  And I imagine you have a similar thing in cellular biology with the emergence of life. So these things together give us evolution  perhaps. And the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal. So what we're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules. And so forgive the molecules on the screen  but these are a very simple kit. There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present. And we can aggregate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big nano molecular molecules the same size of DNA and proteins  but there's no carbon in sight. Carbon is banned. And so with this Lego kit  we have the diversity required for complex information storage without DNA. But we need to make some containers. And just a few months ago in my lab  we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them. And you can see on the screen a cell being made. And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell. And all I wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes  in real cells  and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism  a molecular survival of the fittest. And this movie here shows this competition between molecules. Molecules are competing for stuff. They're all made of the same stuff  but they want their shape to win. They want their shape to persist. And that is the key. If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete  they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete. If we manage to do that  forget the molecular detail. Let's zoom out to what that could mean. So we have this special theory of evolution that applies only to organic biology  to us. If we could get evolution into the material world  then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution. And that's really worth thinking about. Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe  Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete  So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution. So you imagine  if we're able to create a self sustaining artificial life form  not only will this tell us about the origin of life    that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive  it can use anything    we can then take  it  one step further and develop new technologies  because we can then use software control for evolution to code in. So imagine we make a little cell. We want to put it out in the environment  and we want it to be powered by the Sun. What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on. And we don't use design anymore. We find what works. We should take our inspiration from biology. Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works. So this will reorganize the way we design things. But not only just that  we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology. Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with  The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything  because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution. Evolution cannot be cut apart. You need to somehow find the fitness function. And the profound realization for me is that  if this works  the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level  and we really start talking about selfish matter. And what does that mean in a universe where we are right now the highest form of stuff  You're sitting on chairs. They're inanimate  they're not alive. But you are made of stuff  and you are using stuff  and you enslave stuff. So using evolution in biology  and in inorganic biology  for me is quite appealing  quite exciting. And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive. And again  when you're thinking about how improbable this is  remember  five billion years ago  we were not here  and there was no life. So what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life  But perhaps  for me as a chemist  I want to keep away from general terms  I want to think about specifics. So what does it mean about defining life  We really struggle to do this. And I think  if we can make inorganic biology  and we can make matter become evolvable  that will in fact define life. I propose to you that matter that can evolve is alive  and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Just a quick question on timeline. You believe you're going to be successful in this project  When  Lee Cronin  So many people think that life took millions of years to kick in. We're proposing to do it in just a few hours  once we've set up the right chemistry. CA  And when do you think that will happen  LC  Hopefully within the next two years. CA  That would be a big story. In your own mind  what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non carbon based life  walking or oozing or something  LC  I think it's     percent. Because the thing is  we are so chauvinistic to biology  if you take away carbon  there's other things that can happen. So the other thing that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon  maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for. Don't go and look for carbon  go and look for evolvable stuff. CA  Lee Cronin  good luck.  LC  Thank you very much.  Hi everyone. I'm an artist and a dad    second time around. Thank you. And I want to share with you my latest art project. It's a children's book for the iPad. It's a little quirky and silly. It's called  Pop It   And it's about the things little kids do with their parents. So this is about potty training    as most of you  I hope  know. You can tickle the rug. You can make the baby poop. You can do all those fun things. You can burst bubbles. You can draw  as everyone should. But you know  I have a problem with children's books  I think they're full of propaganda. At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope  forget it. It's not the way I was brought up. So I said   I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda.  If you notice carefully  it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child. You don't like it  Shake it  and you have a lesbian couple. Shake it  and you have a heterosexual couple. You know  I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family. I have to tell you about my childhood. I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns  fathers  brothers  sisters. Basically  I was brought up to be a good Samaritan  and I am. And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house  which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood. Basically  I celebrated every religious function. In fact  when there was a wedding in our neighborhood  all of us would paint our houses for the wedding. I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani. We all had to fast during Ramadan. It was a very beautiful time. But I must say  I'll never forget  when I was    years old  this happened. Babri Masjid    one of the most beautiful mosques in India  built by King Babur  I think  in the   th century    was demolished by Hindu activists. This caused major riots in my city. And for the first time  I was affected by this communal unrest. My little five year old kid neighbor comes running in  and he says   Rags  Rags. You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful.  I'm like   Dude  I'm Hindu.  He's like   Huh   You know  my work is inspired by events such as this. Even in my gallery shows  I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid  distill only its emotional residue and image my own life. Imagine history being taught differently. Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change  I have another idea. It's a children's book about Indian independence    very patriotic. But when you shake it  you get Pakistan's perspective. Shake it again  and you get the British perspective. You have to separate fact from bias  right. Even my books on children have cute  fuzzy animals. But they're playing geopolitics. They're playing out Israel Palestine  India Pakistan. You know  I'm making a very important argument. And my argument  is  that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage. After all  children's books are manuals on parenting  so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives. And conversely  only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them. I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy. You know  I can't promise my child a life without bias    we're all biased    but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. Thank you very much. My topic is economic growth in China and India. And the question I want to explore with you is whether or not democracy has helped or has hindered economic growth. You may say this is not fair  because I'm selecting two countries to make a case against democracy. Actually  exactly the opposite is what I'm going to do. I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy  rather than against democracy. The first question there is why China has grown so much faster than India. Over the last    years  in terms of the GDP growth rates  China has grown at twice the rate of India. In the last five years  the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth. But over the last    years  China undoubtedly has done much better than India. One simple answer is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai. Look at the skyline of Shanghai. This is the Pudong area. The picture on India is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai in India. The idea there behind these two pictures is that the Chinese government can act above rule of law. It can plan for the long term benefits of the country and in the process  evict millions of people    that's just a small technical issue. Whereas in India  you cannot do that  because you have to listen to the public. You're being constrained by the public's opinion. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agrees with that view. In an interview printed in the financial press of India  He said that he wants to make Mumbai another Shanghai. This is an Oxford trained economist steeped in humanistic values  and yet he agrees with the high pressure tactics of Shanghai. So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth  that emphasizes the following features for promoting economic development  infrastructures  airports  highways  bridges  things like that. And you need a strong government to do that  because you cannot respect private property rights. You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion. You need also state ownership  especially of land assets  in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly. The implication of that model is that democracy is a hindrance for economic growth  rather than a facilitator of economic growth. Here's the key question. Just how important are infrastructures for economic growth  This is a key issue. If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth  then you would argue a strong government is necessary to promote growth. If you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe  then you will put less emphasis on strong government. So to illustrate that question  let me give you two countries. And for the sake of brevity  I'll call one country Country   and the other country Country  . Country   has a systematic advantage over Country   in infrastructures. Country   has more telephones  and Country   has a longer system of railways. So if I were to ask you   Which is China and which is India  and which country has grown faster   if you believe in the infrastructure view  then you will say   Country   must be China. They must have done better  in terms of economic growth. And Country   is possibly India.  Actually the country with more telephones is the Soviet Union  and the data referred to     . After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones  the country collapsed. That's not too good. The picture there is Khrushchev. I know that in      he no longer ruled the Soviet Union  but that's the best picture that I can find. Telephones  infrastructures do not guarantee you economic growth. Country    that has fewer telephones  is China. Since       the country has performed at a double digit rate every year for the last    years. If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union other than the fact about their telephones  you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades. Country    that has a longer system of railways  is actually India. And Country   is China. This is a very little known fact about the two countries. Yes  today China has a huge infrastructure advantage over India. But for many years  until the late     s  China had an infrastructure disadvantage vis a vis India. In developing countries  the most common mode of transportation is the railways  and the British built a lot of railways in India. India is the smaller of the two countries  and yet it had a longer system of railways until the late     s. So clearly  infrastructure doesn't explain why China did better before the late     s  as compared with India. In fact  if you look at the evidence worldwide  the evidence is more supportive of the view that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth. The economy grows  government accumulates more resources  and the government can invest in infrastructure    rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth. And this is clearly the story of the Chinese economic growth. Let me look at this question more directly. Is democracy bad for economic growth  Now let's turn to two countries  Country A and Country B. Country A  in       had about      per capita GDP as compared with Country B  which had      in per capita GDP. By       Country A has surpassed Country B with      per capita GDP as compared with      per capita GDP. Both countries are in Asia. If I were to ask you   Which are the two Asian countries  And which one is a democracy   you may argue   Well  maybe Country A is China and Country B is India.  In fact  Country A is democratic India  and Country B is Pakistan    the country that has a long period of military rule. And it's very common that we compare India with China. That's because the two countries have about the same population size. But the more natural comparison is actually between India and Pakistan. Those two countries are geographically similar. They have a complicated  but shared common history. By that comparison  democracy looks very  very good in terms of economic growth. So why do economists fall in love with authoritarian governments  One reason is the East Asian Model. In East Asia  we have had successful economic growth stories such as Korea  Taiwan  Hong Kong and Singapore. Some of these economies were ruled by authoritarian governments in the   s and   s and     s. The problem with that view is like asking all the winners of lotteries   Have you won the lottery   And they all tell you   Yes  we have won the lottery.  And then you draw the conclusion the odds of winning the lottery are     percent. The reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn't end up winning the prize. For each of these successful authoritarian governments in East Asia  there's a matched failure. Korea succeeded  North Korea didn't. Taiwan succeeded  China under Mao Zedong didn't. Burma didn't succeed. The Philippines didn't succeed. If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide  there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth. So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias    it is known as selecting on a dependent variable  something we always tell our students to avoid. So exactly why did China grow so much faster  I will take you to the Cultural Revolution  when China went mad  and compare that country's performance with India under Indira Gandhi. The question there is  Which country did better  China or India  China was during the Cultural Revolution. It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution  China out perfomed India in terms of GDP growth by an average of about  .  percent every year in terms of per capita GDP. So that's when China was mad. The whole country went mad. It must mean that the country had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth to overcome the negative effects of the Cultural Revolution. The advantage the country had was human capital    nothing else but human capital. This is the world development index indicator data in the early     s. And this is the earliest data that I can find. The adult literacy rate in China is    percent as compared with    percent in India. The contrast in literacy rates is especially sharp between Chinese women and Indian women. I haven't told you about the definition of literacy. In China  the definition of literacy is the ability to read and write       Chinese characters. In India  the definition of literacy  operating definition of literacy  is the ability  the grand ability  to write your own name in whatever language you happen to speak. The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated. If you go to other sources of data such as Human Development Index  that data series  go back to the early     s  you see exactly the same contrast. China held a huge advantage in terms of human capital vis a vis India. Life expectancies  as early as       China had a huge advantage in life expectancy. On average  as a Chinese in       you lived    years more than an average Indian. So if you have a choice between being a Chinese and being an Indian  you would want to become a Chinese in order to live    years longer. If you made that decision in       the down side of that is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution. So you have to always think carefully about these decisions. If you cannot chose your nationality  then you will want to become an Indian man. Because  as an Indian man  you have about two years of life expectancy advantage vis a vis Indian women. This is an extremely strange fact. It's very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern. It shows the systematic discrimination and biases in the Indian society against women. The good news is  by       India has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy. Today  Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge over Indian men. So India is reverting to the normal. But India still has a lot of work to do in terms of gender equality. These are the two pictures taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province and garment factories in India. In China  it's all women.    to    percent of the workforce in China is women in the coastal part of the country  whereas in India  it's all men. Financial Times printed this picture of an Indian textile factory with the title   India Poised to Overtake China in Textile.  By looking at these two pictures  I say no  it won't overtake China for a while. If you look at other East Asian countries  women there play a hugely important role in terms of economic take off    in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle associated with East Asia. India still has a long way to go to catch up with China. Then the issue is  what about the Chinese political system  You talk about human capital  you talk about education and public health. What about the political system  Isn't it true that the one party political system has facilitated economic growth in China  Actually  the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that. It depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system. Statically  China is a one party system  authoritarian    there's no question about it. Dynamically  it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic. When you explain change    for example  economic growth  economic growth is about change    when you explain change  you use other things that have changed to explain change  rather than using the constant to explain change. Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change  but a fixed effect only explains changes in interaction with the things that change. In terms of the political changes  they have introduced village elections. They have increased the security of proprietors. And they have increased the security with long term land leases. There are also financial reforms in rural China. There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China. To me  the pace of political changes is too slow  too gradual. And my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges  because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms. But nevertheless  the system has moved in a more liberal direction  moved in a more democratic direction. You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India. In fact  when India was growing at a Hindu rate of growth    about one percent  two percent a year    that was when India was least democratic. Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in     . The Indian government owned and operated all the TV stations. A little known fact about India in the     s is that the country not only has undertaken economic reforms  the country has also undertaken political reforms by introducing village self rule  privatization of media and introducing freedom of information acts. So the dynamic perspective fits both with China and in India in terms of the direction. Why do many people believe that India is still a growth disaster  One reason is they are always comparing India with China. But China is a superstar in terms of economic growth. If you are a NBA player and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan  you're going to look not so impressive. But that doesn't mean that you're a bad basketball player. Comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark. In fact  if you compare India with the average developing country  even before the more recent period of acceleration of Indian growth    now India is growing between eight and nine percent    even before this period  India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies. This is a very impressive record indeed. Let's think about the future  the dragon vis a vis the elephant. Which country has the growth momentum  China  I believe  still has some of the excellent raw fundamentals    mostly the social capital  the public health  the sense of egalitarianism that you don't find in India. But I believe that India has the momentum. It has the improving fundamentals. The government has invested in basic education  has invested in basic health. I believe the government should do more  but nevertheless  the direction it is moving in is the right direction. India has the right institutional conditions for economic growth  whereas China is still struggling with political reforms. I believe that the political reforms are a must for China to maintain its growth. And it's very important to have political reforms  to have widely shared benefits of economic growth. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not  but I'm an optimist. Hopefully  five years from now  I'm going to report to TEDGlobal that political reforms will happen in China. Thank you very much. Now this is a very un TED like thing to do  but let's kick off the afternoon with a message from a mystery sponsor. Anonymous  Dear Fox News  it has come to our unfortunate attention that both the name and nature of Anonymous has been ravaged. We are everyone. We are no one. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are but the base of chaos. Misha Glenny  Anonymous  ladies and gentlemen    a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in     . And they're pretty scary. You never know when they're going to attack next  who or what the consequences will be. But interestingly  they have a sense of humor. These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account to announce President Obama's assassination. Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox.  What do we do now  Put on a black armband  or crack open the champagne   And of course  who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. being a victim of hacking for a change. Sometimes you turn on the news and you say   Is there anyone left to hack   Sony Playstation Network    done  the government of Turkey    tick  Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency    a breeze  the CIA    falling off a log. In fact  a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world  those that know they've been hacked  and those that don't. I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. Is nothing sacred anymore  for heaven's sake  Anyway  this mysterious group Anonymous    and they would say this themselves    they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data. But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous    they are ideologically driven. They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy. They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it  and that they  Anonymous  are the authentic voice of resistance    be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships  against global media corporations  or against intelligence agencies  or whoever it is. And their politics are not entirely unattractive. Okay  they're a little inchoate. There's a strong whiff of half baked anarchism about them. But one thing is true  we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet. The Web links everything  and very soon it will mediate most human activity. Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom. Now this is a very complicated struggle. And unfortunately  for mortals like you and me  we probably can't understand it very well. Nonetheless  in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago  I decided I would try and do that. And I sort of get it. These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it. But in order to try and explain the whole thing  I would need another    minutes or so to do it  so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion  and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other  but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around. So there you are. And as you see  in the middle  there is our old friend  the hacker. The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political  social and economic issues affecting the Net. And so I thought to myself   Well  these are the guys who I want to talk to.  And what do you know  nobody else does talk to the hackers. They're completely anonymous  as it were. So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions  hundreds of billions of dollars  into cybersecurity    for the most extraordinary technical solutions    no one wants to talk to these guys  the hackers  who are doing everything. Instead  we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions  which cost a huge amount of money. And so nothing is going into the hackers. Well  I say nothing  but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin  Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics  into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. But because they're a U.N. operation  maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them. Because it's a U.N. operation  of course  it lacks funding. But I think they're doing very important work. Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry  we have a definite lack of    call me old fashioned    human intelligence. Now  so far I've mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group. Of course  the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals. But interestingly  Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. But what about the real cybercriminals  Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about    years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website  which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet. This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. Now CarderPlanet was very interesting. Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details  to exchange information about new malware that was out there. And remember  this is a time when we're seeing for the first time so called off the shelf malware. This is ready for use  out of the box stuff  which you can deploy even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker. And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial  because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals. And that challenge is  How do you do business  how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they're a criminal  It's axiomatic that they're dodgy  and they're going to want to try and rip you off. So the family  as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known  came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system. They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser. The vendor  say  had stolen credit card details  the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them. The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally  and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details. And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked. And if they did  he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser. And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web. And after that  it just went wild. We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders. Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we'll call RedBrigade    although that wasn't even his proper nickname    but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was. And he explained to me how in      and      he would go on sprees in New York  taking out         from an ATM here          from an ATM there  using cloned credit cards. He was making  on average a week              tax free of course. And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper East side apartment at one point that he just didn't know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. But that's a slightly different story  which I won't go into now. Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn't an advanced hacker. He sort of understood the technology  and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder  but he didn't spend his days and nights bent over a computer  eating pizza  drinking coke and that sort of thing. He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life. And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise. And often they're the most vulnerable element of all. And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. Dimitry Golubov  aka SCRIPT    born in Odessa  Ukraine in     . Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the     s. This was a sink or swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive. As an accomplished computer user  what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web. And he did a great job in it. You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday  the only environment he knew was gangsterism. He knew no other way of making a living and making money. Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam  aka JiLsi    founder of DarkMarket  born in Colombo  Sri Lanka. As an eight year old  he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city  looking for Tamils like Renu to murder. At     he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military  accused of being a terrorist  and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum. At     with only little English and being bullied at school  he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability  but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet. He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud  and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in     . Matrix     who was an administrator at DarkMarket. Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well respected middle class family  his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking. And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated. His slide into criminality was incremental. And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications  he was already in too deep. Max Vision  aka ICEMAN    mastermind of CardersMarket. Born in Meridian  Idaho. Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara  California in the late   s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI. Now in the late     s  he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks  and he went in and patched it up    because this included nuclear research facilities    sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment. But also  because he was an inveterate hacker  he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl. But this was spotted by an eagle eye investigator  and he was convicted. At his open prison  he came under the influence of financial fraudsters  and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release. And this man with a planetary sized brain is now serving a    year sentence in California. Adewale Taiwo  aka FreddyBB    master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria. He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup  bankfrauds yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in      to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University. He impressed in the private sector  developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in     . And then finally  Cagatay Evyapan  aka Cha     one of the most remarkable hackers ever  from Ankara in Turkey. He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal. One of the smartest people I've ever met. He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals. Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments. They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid teens. They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences. Remember that  when they developed those hacking skills  their moral compass had not yet developed. And most of them  with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha   they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world    only on the Web. And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger's syndrome. Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron Cohen who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. And he has done path breaking work on autism and confirmed  also for the authorities here  that Gary McKinnon    who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon    suffers from Asperger's and a secondary condition of depression. And Baron Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills  and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped. Now I think we're missing a trick here  because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail. And let me be blunt about this. In China  in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber offensive capabilities  this is exactly what they are doing. They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities    are mobilizing them on behalf of the state. We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people  because they are a remarkable breed. And if we rely  as we do at the moment  solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences  we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame. Thank you very much for listening. Chris Anderson  So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers. How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole  MG  I think to an extent  you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that. They're just relentless and obsessive about what they do. But all of the people who I've spoken to who have fallen foul of the law  they have all said   Please  please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry. We just never knew how to get there  what we were doing. We want to work with you.  Chris Anderson  Okay  well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha. My name is Kate Hartman. And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate. So I'm specifically interested in how we  as humans  relate to ourselves  each other and the world around us. So just to give you a bit of context  as June said  I'm an artist  a technologist and an educator. I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics. And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form. And so anytime I talk about what I do  I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter. And it's pretty simple. Everybody's got one    all of you. I can guarantee  everyone in this room  all of you over there  the people in the cushy seats  the people up top with the laptops    we all have bodies. Don't be ashamed. It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world. And so when working as an interaction designer  or as an artist who deals with participation    creating things that live on  in or around the human form    it's really a powerful space to work within. So within my own work  I use a broad range of materials and tools. So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing. And to tell you a bit about the things that I make  the easiest place to start the story is with a hat. And so it all started several years ago  late one night when I was sitting on the subway  riding home  and I was thinking. And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little. And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises    like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head    if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else. And so I went home  and I made a prototype of this hat. And I called it the Muttering Hat  because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you  but you could detach them and share them with somebody else. So I make other hats as well. This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat. It's fairly self explanatory. It physically carves out conversation space for one. And when you speak out loud  the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears. And so when I make these things  it's really not so much about the object itself  but rather the negative space around the object. So what happens when a person puts this thing on  What kind of an experience do they have  And how are they transformed by wearing it  So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves. So this particular device is called the Gut Listener. And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards. And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication. And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves. So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions. So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst. And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences. So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments. And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange  but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered. And in the end  some of these things just act as invitations. So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say. So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people  I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us. And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back  I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them. And I thought   Well  hey  Maybe if I want to better relate to walls  maybe I need to be more wall like myself.  So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack. And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me. And so jumping off of that  thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world  I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls    which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols. So when a plant is thirsty  it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter. And so this really shifts the human plant dynamic  because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time. And so kind of thinking about scale  my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers    of course. And so glaciers are these magnificent beings  and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them  but what I'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations. Because there seems to be an issue. The glaciers are actually leaving us. They're both shrinking and retreating    and some of them have disappeared altogether. And so I actually live in Canada now  so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers. And this one's particularly interesting  because  of all the glaciers in North America  it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year. They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier. And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter. When I meet a glacier for the very first time  what do I do  There's no kind of social protocol for this. I really just don't even know how to say hello. Do I carve a message in the snow  Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes    ice cube Morse code. Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool  like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice. But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening  which is what we need in any good relationship. And I was really struck by how much it affected me. This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier. And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days  I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit. And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice. And once again  it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug. So  yea  this is actually just the beginning. These are initial musings for this project. And just as with the wall  how I wanted to be more wall like  with this project  I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace. And so my intent is to actually just take the next    years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines    artists  technologists  scientists    to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human glacier relations. So beyond that  in closing  I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation  and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy  but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen  I present to you the human genome. Chromosome one  top left. Bottom right are the sex chromosomes. Women have two copies of that big X chromosome  men have the X and  of course  that small copy of the Y. Sorry boys  but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different. So if you zoom in on this genome  then what you see  of course  is this double helix structure    the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters  or we call them bases  right  A  C  G and T. How many are there in the human genome  Three billion. Is that a big number  Well  everybody can throw around big numbers. But in fact  if I were to place one base on each pixel of this      by     resolution screen  we would need       screens to take a look at the genome. So it's really quite big. And perhaps because of its size  a group of people    all  by the way  with Y chromosomes    decided they would want to sequence it. And so    years  actually  and about four billion dollars later  the genome was sequenced and published. In       the final version was published  and they keep working on it. That was all done on a machine that looks like this. It costs about a dollar for each base    a very slow way of doing it. Well folks  I'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it. So now what we do is we take a genome  we make maybe    copies of it  we cut all those copies up into little    base reads  and then we sequence them  massively parallel. And then we bring that into software  and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is. And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like  the Human Genome Project    gigabases  right. One run on one of these machines      gigabases in a week. And that     is going to change to     this summer  and there's no sign of this pace slowing. So the price of a base  to sequence a base  has fallen     million times. That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in       waiting until       and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice. World population  PC placements  the archive of all the medical literature  Moore's law  the old way of sequencing  and here's all the new stuff. Guys  this is a log scale  you don't typically see lines that go up like that. So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like        to         human genomes this year. And we know this based on the machines that are being placed. This is expected to double  triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future. In fact  there's one lab in particular that represents    percent of all that capacity. It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute. The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon  by the way. What does this mean for medicine  So a woman is age   . She presents with stage   estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. She is treated with surgery  chemotherapy and radiation. She goes home. Two years later  she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer. Unfortunately  treated again with surgery and chemotherapy. She comes back three years later at age    with more ovarian cancer  more chemotherapy. Six months later  she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia. She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later. So first  the way in which this woman was treated  in as little as    years  will look like bloodletting. And it's because of people like my colleague  Rick Wilson  at the Genome Institute at Washington University  who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem. And he sequenced  he took skin cells  healthy skin  and cancerous bone marrow  and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks  no big deal. And then he compared those two genomes in software  and what he found  among other things  was a deletion  a       base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP  . If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene  you're    percent likely to get cancer in your life. So unfortunately  this doesn't help this woman  but it does have severe  profound if you will  implications to her family. I mean  if they have the same mutation  and they get this genetic test  and they understand it  then they can go and get regular screens  and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life. Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two. Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up  and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching  she was able to convince the medical community that  in fact  they had something else. What they had was dopa responsive dystonia. And so they were given L Dopa  and their symptoms did improve  but they weren't totally asymptomatic. Significant problems remained. Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery  who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies. They're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools. And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced. And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR  which is responsible for producing serotonin  among other things. So on top of L Dopa  they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug  and they're effectively normal now. Guys  this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing. And at the time    this was a few years ago    it cost         . Today it's        . Next year it's       . The year after it's       give or take a year. That's how fast this is moving. So here's little Nick    likes Batman and squirt guns. And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim. And it's not that he's not eating  it's that when he eats  his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut. So a hundred surgeries later  he looks at his mom and says   Mom  please pray for me. I'm in so much pain.  His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on  but he says   Let's get this kid's genome sequenced.  And what they find is a single point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death. So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially  and that's a natural reaction  which causes some programmed cell death. But the gene that regulates that down is broken. And so this informs  among other things  of course  a treatment for bone marrow transplant  which he undertakes. And after nine months of grueling recovery  he's now eating steak with A  sauce. The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today. Today  it's here. And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five         years just because of this one thing. Which is a fantastic story  unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production. So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn  wheat  soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought  of flood  of pests and pesticides. Now look  as long as we continue to increase the population  we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods  and that's the only position that I'll take today. Unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating  None  not one. This is a typewriter  a staple of every desktop for decades. And in fact  the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing. And then more general versions of word processors came about. But ultimately  it was a disruption on top of a disruption. It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything. And suddenly we had Netscape  and we had Yahoo and we had  indeed  the entire dotcom bubble. Not to worry though  that was quickly rescued by the iPod  Facebook and  indeed  angry birds. Look  this is where we are today. This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are. So what I'd like you to consider is  What does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome  but they connect to genomes all across the planet  So I just recently had to buy life insurance. And I was required to answer  A. I have never had a genetic test  B. I've had one  here you go  and C. I've had one and I'm not telling. Thankfully  I was able to answer A  and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening. But what would have happened if I had said C  Consumer applications for genomics  they will flourish. Do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend  Sure. DNA sequencing on your iPhone  There's an app for that. Personalized genomic massage anyone  There's already a lab today that tests for allele     of the AVPR  gene  the so called cheating gene. So anybody who's here today with your significant other  just turn over to them and swab their mouth  send it to the lab and you'll know for sure. Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy  Now think of it  it's      and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns  but also her personal genome. And it looks really good. And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same. Do you think that's not going to happen  Do you think it would have helped John McCain  How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me  Raise your hand. Anybody  Nobody. Typically  there's one or two. So my father's father was one of    Resnick brothers. They all hated each other. And they all moved to different parts of the planet. So it's likely that I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet  but I don't know. But imagine if my genome were deidentified  sitting in software  and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there  and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations. Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now. And so imagine one more thing  that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents   Would you be willing to meet your third cousin   And if we both say yes  voila  Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn. Now this is probably a good thing  right  You have bigger clan gatherings and so on. But maybe it's a bad thing as well. How many fathers in the room  Raise your hands. Okay  so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child. Look    These genomes  these    chromosomes  they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society    at least not yet. And like any new technology  it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind  or not. And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you. Thank you. I want to say that really and truly  after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread  I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television. So most everyone watches TV. We like it. We like some parts of it. Here in America  people actually love TV. The average American watches TV for almost   hours a day. Okay  Now I happen to make my living these days in television  so for me  that's a good thing. But a lot of people don't love it so much. They  in fact  berate it. They call it stupid  and worse  believe me. My mother  growing up  she called it the  idiot box.  But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV  my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral  political  social and emotional need states of our nation    that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system. So all these things are uniquely human  and they all add up to our idea of conscience. Now today  we're not talking about good and bad TV. We're talking about popular TV. We're talking about top    Nielsen rated shows over the course of    years. How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about  which is the idea of our social  collective unconscious  but how do these top    Nielsen rated shows over    years reflect the idea of our social conscience  How does television evolve over time  and what does this say about our society  Now speaking of evolution  from basic biology  you probably remember that the animal kingdom  including humans  have four basic primal instincts. You have hunger  you have sex  you have power  and you have the urge for acquisitiveness. As humans  what's important to remember is that we've developed  we've evolved over time to temper  or tame  these basic animal instincts. We have the capacity to laugh and cry. We feel awe  we feel pity. That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom. The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained. We love to watch TV. This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom. Animals might love to play  but they don't love to watch. So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious. Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has  I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders. Is television literally functioning as our conscience  tempting us and rewarding us at the same time  So to begin to answer these questions  we did a research study. We went back    years to the           television season. We surveyed the top    Nielsen shows every year for    years    a thousand shows. We talked to over       individuals    almost          aged    to     and we asked them how they felt emotionally. How did you feel watching every single one of these shows  Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity  Did you feel outrage  Did you laugh  What did this mean for you  So to our global TED audiences  I want to say that this was a U.S. sample. But as you can see  these emotional need states are truly universal. And on a factual basis  over    percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world. So I really hope our global audiences can relate. Two acknowledgments before our first data slide  For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis  I thank legendary rabbi  Jack Stern. And for the way in which I'm going to present the data  I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling  who you may have just seen. Okay  here we go. So here you see  from      to       the    years of our study. Two things we're going to start with    the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state  which  for this purpose  we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me  that make me feel much more positive about the world. Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong. As we start  you see in      inspiration is holding steady. That's what we're watching TV for. Moral ambiguity starts to climb. Right at the end of the   s  moral ambiguity is going up  inspiration is kind of on the wane. Why  The Cuban Missile Crisis  JFK is shot  the Civil Rights movement  race riots  the Vietnam War  MLK is shot  Bobby Kennedy is shot  Watergate. Look what happens. In       inspiration plummets. Moral ambiguity takes off. They cross  but Ronald Reagan  a telegenic president  is in office. It's trying to recover. But look  it can't  AIDS  Iran Contra  the Challenger disaster  Chernobyl. Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from      for the next    years. Take a look at this. This chart is going to document a very similar trend. But in this case  we have comfort    the bubble in red    social commentary and irreverence in blue and green. Now this time on TV you have  Bonanza   don't forget  you have  Gunsmoke   you have  Andy Griffith   you have domestic shows all about comfort. This is rising. Comfort stays whole. Irreverence starts to rise. Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up. You get to       and look what happens. You have comfort  irreverence  and social commentary  not only battling it out in our society  but you literally have two establishment shows     Gunsmoke  and  Gomer Pyle     in      are the number two  and number three rated television shows. What's number one  The socially irreverent hippie show   Rowan and Martin's Laugh In.  They're all living together  right. Viewers had responded dramatically. Look at this green spike in      to a bellwether show. When you guys hear this industry term  a breakout hit  what does that mean  It means in the      television season  The  Smothers Brothers  came out of nowhere. This was the first show that allowed viewers to say   My God  I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War  about the presidency  through television   That's what we mean by a breakout show. So then  just like the last chart  look what happens. In       the dam bursts. The dam bursts. Comfort is no longer why we watch television. Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the   s. Now look at this. The   s means who  Norman Lear. You have  All in the Family    Sanford and Son   and the dominant show    in the top    for the entire   s     MAS H.  In the entire    years of television that we studied  seven of    shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War  five of the top    during the Nixon administration. Only one generation     years in  and we discovered  Wow  TV can do that  It can make me feel this  It can change us  So to this very  very savvy crowd  I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive. Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us    years ago. This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute  fantasy and imagination  which are shows defined as   takes me out of my everyday realm  and  makes me feel better.  That's mapped against the red dot  unemployment  which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic. You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise  it maps to a spike in unemployment. Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed  No. In the   s you have the bellwether show  The Bionic Woman  that rocketed into the top    in       followed by the  Six Million Dollar Man  and  Charlie's Angels.  Another spike in the     s    another spike in shows about control and power. What were those shows  Glamorous and rich.  Dallas    Fantasy Island.  Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts  unemployment. So here you are  in my favorite chart  because this is our last    years. Whether or not you're in my business  you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV. Well  as we say in the business  X marks the spot. The   s    the big bubbles of humor    we're watching  Friends    Frasier    Cheers  and  Seinfeld.  Everything's good  low unemployment. But look  X marks the spot. In       the September      television season  humor succumbs to judgment once and for all. Why not  We had a      presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. We had the bursting of the tech bubble. We had     . Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. Look what happens when we keep going. At the turn of the century  the Internet takes off  reality television has taken hold. What do people want in their TV then  I would have thought revenge or nostalgia. Give me some comfort  my world is falling apart. No  they want judgment. I can vote you off the island. I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. That's all great  right  So as dramatically different as these television shows  pure entertainment  have been over the last    years    what did I start with     one basic instinct remains. We're animals  we need our moms. There has not been a decade of television without a definitive  dominant TV mom. The     s  June Cleever in the original comfort show   Leave it to Beaver.  Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the   s. Maude Findlay  the epitome of the irreverent     s  who tackled abortion  divorce  even menopause on TV. The     s  our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. This era's mom  Bree Van de Kamp. Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience  sitting on television's shoulders  but I do know that I absolutely love this image. So to you all  the women of TEDWomen  the men of TEDWomen  the global audiences of TEDWomen  thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television. But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television. They give it life on television  for sure  but it's you as viewers  through your collective social consciences  that give it life  longevity  power or not. So thanks very much. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about past and future billions. We know that about     billion people have ever lived. And we know that most of them are dead. And we also know that most of them live or lived in Asia. And we also know that most of them were or are very poor    did not live for very long. Let's talk about billions. Let's talk about the         billion dollars of wealth in the world today. We know that most of that wealth was made after the year     . And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners  Europeans  North Americans  Australasians.    percent of the world's population today  Westerners own two thirds of its wealth. Economic historians call this  The Great Divergence.  And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you. It's basically two ratios of per capita GDP  per capita gross domestic product  so average income. One  the red line  is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income. And the blue line is the ratio of American to Chinese. And this chart goes back to     . And you can see here that there's an exponential Great Divergence. They start off pretty close together. In fact  in       the average Chinese was richer than the average North American. When you get to the     s  which is where this chart ends  the average Briton is more than    times richer than the average Indian. And that's allowing for differences in the cost of living. It's based on purchasing power parity. The average American is nearly    times richer than the average Chinese by the     s. So why  This wasn't just an economic story. If you take the    countries that went on to become the Western empires  in      they were really quite tiny    five percent of the world's land surface     percent of its population  maybe    percent of its income. By       these    countries  plus the United States  controlled vast global empires       percent of the world's territory  about the same percentage of its population  and a really huge  nearly three quarters share of global economic output. And notice  most of that went to the motherland  to the imperial metropoles  not to their colonial possessions. Now you can't just blame this on imperialism    though many people have tried to do so    for two reasons. One  empire was the least original thing that the West did after     . Everybody did empire. They beat preexisting Oriental empires like the Mughals and the Ottomans. So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence. In any case  as you may remember  the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the     s  some considerable time after decolonization. This is not a new question. Samuel Johnson  the great lexicographer   posed  it through his character Rasselas in his novel  Rasselas  Prince of Abissinia   published in     .  By what means are the Europeans thus powerful  or why  since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest  cannot the Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts  plant colonies in their ports  and give laws to their natural princes  The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither   That's a great question. And you know what  it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the Resterners    by the people in the rest of the world    like Ibrahim Muteferrika  an Ottoman official  the man who introduced printing  very belatedly  to the Ottoman Empire    who said in a book published in        Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies   Unlike Rasselas  Muteferrika had an answer to that question  which was correct. He said it was  because they have laws and rules invented by reason.  It's not geography. You may think we can explain the Great Divergence in terms of geography. We know that's wrong  because we conducted two great natural experiments in the   th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions. We took all the Germans  we divided them roughly in two  and we gave the ones in the East communism  and you see the result. Within an incredibly short period of time  people living in the German Democratic Republic produced Trabants  the Trabbi  one of the world's worst ever cars  while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz. If you still don't believe me  we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula. And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with  notice  the same basic traditional culture  and we divided them in two  and we gave the Northerners communism. And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany. Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly  but in almost every other respect  it's a huge divergence. Which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character  popular explanations for this kind of thing  are really significant. It's the ideas. It's the institutions. This must be true because a Scotsman said it. And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED. So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman. He was Adam Smith    not Billy Connolly  not Sean Connery    though he is very smart indeed. Smith    and I want you to go and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile  it's a wonderful statue    Smith  in the  Wealth of Nations  published in         that's the most important thing that happened that year ... You bet. There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies  but ...  China seems to have been long stationary  and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions. But this complement may be much inferior to what  with other laws and institutions  the nature of its soil  climate  and situation might admit of.  That is so right and so cool. And he said it such a long time ago. But you know  this is a TED audience  and if I keep talking about institutions  you're going to turn off. So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand. Let's call them the killer apps. I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest. And they're kind of like the apps on your phone  in the sense that they look quite simple. They're just icons  you click on them. But behind the icon  there's complex code. It's the same with institutions. There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence. One  competition. Two  the scientific revolution. Three  property rights. Four  modern medicine. Five  the consumer society. And six  the work ethic. You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at  or try and boil it down to just four  but you'll lose. Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this  synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process. Competition means  not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in       but within each of these units  there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns. The ancestor of the modern corporation  the City of London Corporation  existed in the   th century. Nothing like this existed in China  where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity  and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination  which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing. The scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world in a number of crucial ways  the most important being that  through the experimental method  it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before. Example  Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application of Newtonian physics to ballistics. Once you do that  your artillery becomes accurate. Think of what that means. That really was a killer application. Meanwhile  there's no scientific revolution anywhere else. The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe  but there's no scientific revolution there. In fact  they demolish Taqi al Din's observatory  because it's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of God. Property rights  It's not the democracy  folks  it's having the rule of law based on private property rights. That's what makes the difference between North America and South America. You could turn up in North America having signed a deed of indenture saying   I'll work for nothing for five years. You just have to feed me.  But at the end of it  you've got a hundred acres of land. That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide. That's not possible in Latin America where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors. And you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between North and South. Most people in rural North America owned some land by     . Hardly anyone in South America did. That's another killer app. Modern medicine in the late   th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people. And this was another killer app    the very opposite of a killer  because it doubled  and then more than doubled  human life expectancy. It even did that in the European empires. Even in places like Senegal  beginning in the early   th century  there were major breakthroughs in public health  and life expectancy began to rise. It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent. The empires weren't all bad. The consumer society is what you need for the Industrial Revolution to have a point. You need people to want to wear tons of clothes. You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month  I guarantee it. That's the consumer society  and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself. Japan was the first non Western society to embrace it. The alternative  which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi  was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent. Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road. Finally  the work ethic. Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant. He was wrong. Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work. We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant  Western phenomenon. In fact  the West has lost its work ethic. Today  the average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German    a thousand. And this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon  and that is the end of the Great Divergence. Who's got the work ethic now  Take a look at mathematical attainment by    year olds. At the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study  is the Shanghai district of China. The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S. and Albania and Tunisia. You probably assume that because the iPhone was designed in California but assembled in China that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation. You're wrong. In terms of patents  there's no question that the East is ahead. Not only has Japan been ahead for some time  South Korea has gone into third place  and China is just about to overtake Germany. Why  Because the killer apps can be downloaded. It's open source. Any society can adopt these institutions  and when they do  they achieve what the West achieved after         only faster. This is the Great Reconvergence  and it's the biggest story of your lifetime. Because it's on your watch that this is happening. It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance. The average American used to be more than    times richer than the average Chinese. Now it's just five times  and soon it will be  .  times. So I want to end with three questions for the future billions  just ahead of       when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China. The first is  can you delete these apps  and are we in the process of doing so in the Western world  The second question is  does the sequencing of the download matter  And could Africa get that sequencing wrong  One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights. Warning  that may not work. And third  can China do without killer app number three  That's the one that John Locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law. That's the basis for the Western model of representative government. Now this picture shows the demolition of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio in Shanghai earlier this year. He's now free again  having been detained  as you know  for some time. But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt. Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of     . And I think these words really nail it   It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians. It means that violence  the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs  the conditions of camps and warfare  of riot and tyranny  give place to parliaments where laws are made  and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained. That is civilization    and in its soil grow continually freedom  comfort and culture   what all TEDsters care about most.  When civilization reigns in any country  a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people.  That's so true. I don't think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable  because I don't think history operates in this kind of life cycle model  beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's  Course of Empire  paintings. That's not the way history works. That's not the way the West rose  and I don't think it's the way the West will fall. The West may collapse very suddenly. Complex civilizations do that  because they operate  most of the time  on the edge of chaos. That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations. No  we may hang on  despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated  despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo. But one thing is for sure  the Great Divergence is over  folks. Thanks very much. Bruno Giussani  Niall  I am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming  which is Latin America. What's your view on that  Niall Ferguson  Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East  I'm talking about the rise of the Rest  and that includes South America. I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard   Hey  is South America part of the West   He was an expert in Latin American history. He said   I don't know  I'll have to think about that.  That tells you something really important. I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular  but also Chile  which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life  there's a very bright future indeed. So my story really is as much about that convergence in the Americas as it's a convergence story in Eurasia. BG  And there is this impression that North America and Europe are not really paying attention to these trends. Mostly they're worried about each other. The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow. The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow. And that's all we seem to be caring about recently. NF  I think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed World right now    both sides of the Atlantic    is essentially the same thing taking different forms in terms of political culture. And it's a crisis that has its structural facet    it's partly to do with demographics. But it's also  of course  to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage  excessive borrowing in the private sector. That crisis  which has been the focus of so much attention  including by me  I think is an epiphenomenon. The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon  which has just accelerated this huge shift  which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy. I think that's its real importance. BG  Niall  thank you.  NF  Thank you very much  Bruno.  Erez Lieberman Aiden  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. So we assembled a team of experts  spanning Harvard  MIT  The American Heritage Dictionary  The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors  the Google. And we cogitated about this for about four years. And we came to a startling conclusion. Ladies and gentlemen  a picture is not worth a thousand words. In fact  we found some pictures that are worth     billion words. Jean Baptiste Michel  So how did we get to this conclusion  So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history  change over time. So many books actually have been written over the years. So we were thinking  well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. Now of course  if there's a scale for how awesome that is  that has to rank extremely  extremely high. Now the problem is there's an X axis for that  which is the practical axis. This is very  very low. Now people tend to use an alternative approach  which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. This is extremely practical  but not so awesome. What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. They have digitized millions of books. So what that means is  one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button. That's very practical and extremely awesome. ELA  Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. Since time immemorial  there have been authors. These authors have been striving to write books. And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. Since then  the authors have won on     million distinct occasions  publishing books. Now if those books are not lost to history  then they are somewhere in a library  and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google  which has scanned    million books to date. Now when Google digitizes a book  they put it into a really nice format. Now we've got the data  plus we have metadata. We have information about things like where was it published  who was the author  when was it published. And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. What we're left with is a collection of five million books      billion words  a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome    a text which  when written out  would stretch from here to the Moon and back    times over    a veritable shard of our cultural genome. Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ... was what any self respecting researchers would have done. We took a page out of XKCD  and we said   Stand back. We're going to try science.  JM  Now of course  we were thinking  well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. Now we're thinking  what data can we release  Well of course  you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. Now Google  and Jon Orwant in particular  told us a little equation that we should learn. So you have five million  that is  five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit. So  although that would be really  really awesome  again  that's extremely  extremely impractical. Now again  we kind of caved in  and we did the very practical approach  which was a bit less awesome. We said  well instead of releasing the full text  we're going to release statistics about the books. So take for instance  A gleam of happiness.  It's four words  we call that a four gram. We're going to tell you how many times a particular four gram appeared in books in                   all the way up to     . That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books  and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. ELA  So those two billion lines  we call them two billion n grams. What do they tell us  Well the individual n grams measure cultural trends. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that I am thriving  then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. And so I might say   Yesterday  I throve.  Alternatively  I could say   Yesterday  I thrived.  Well which one should I use  How to know  As of about six months ago  the state of the art in this field is that you would  for instance  go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair  and you'd say   Steve  you're an expert on the irregular verbs. What should I do   And he'd tell you   Well most people say thrived  but some people say throve.  And you also knew  more or less  that if you were to go back in time     years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair   Tom  what should I say   He'd say   Well  in my day  most people throve  but some thrived.  So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. Two rows from this table of two billion entries. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of  thrived  and  throve  over time. Now this is just two out of two billion rows. So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide. JM  Now there are many other pictures that are worth     billion words. For instance  this one. If you just take influenza  you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. ELA  If you were not yet convinced  sea levels are rising  so is atmospheric CO  and global temperature. JM  You might also want to have a look at this particular n gram  and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead  although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. ELA  You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing. For instance  let me tell you the history of the year     . Pretty much for the vast majority of history  no one gave a damn about     . In       in       in       no one cared. Through the   s and   s  no one cared. Suddenly  in the mid   s  there started to be a buzz. People realized that      was going to happen  and it could be big. But nothing got people interested in      like the year     . People were walking around obsessed. They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in       all the things they were planning to do in       all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in     . In fact       was so fascinating that for years thereafter  people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened  in '    '    '  . Finally in       someone woke up and realized that      had gotten somewhat pass . And just like that  the bubble burst. And the story of      is the story of every year that we have on record  with a little twist  because now we've got these nice charts. And because we have these nice charts  we can measure things. We can say   Well how fast does the bubble burst   And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. Equations were derived  graphs were produced  and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year. We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. JM  Now a little piece of career advice. So for those of you who seek to be famous  we can learn from the    most famous political figures  authors  actors and so on. So if you want to become famous early on  you should be an actor  because then fame starts rising by the end of your   s    you're still young  it's really great. Now if you can wait a little bit  you should be an author  because then you rise to very great heights  like Mark Twain  for instance  extremely famous. But if you want to reach the very top  you should delay gratification and  of course  become a politician. So here you will become famous by the end of your   s  and become very  very famous afterward. So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older. Like for instance  biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors. One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. If you do that  you might think   Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my   s.  But guess what  nobody will really care. ELA  There are more sobering notes among the n grams. For instance  here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall  an artist born in     . And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. He gets more and more and more famous  except if you look in German. If you look in German  you see something completely bizarre  something you pretty much never see  which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets  going through a nadir between      and       before rebounding afterward. And of course  what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. Here's a simple way to do it. Well  a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. So that's sort of what we expect. And we compare that to the fame that we observe. And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. If the suppression index is very  very  very small  then you very well might be being suppressed. If it's very large  maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. JM  Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. So for instance  here    this suppression index is for       people picked in English books where there's no known suppression    it would be like this  basically tightly centered on one. What you expect is basically what you observe. This is distribution as seen in Germany    very different  it's shifted to the left. People talked about it twice less as it should have been. But much more importantly  the distribution is much wider. There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about    times fewer than they should have been. But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda. This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. ELA  So culturomics is what we call this method. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics is similar. It's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. Here  instead of through the lens of a genome  through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record. The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it. Why can everyone do it  Everyone can do it because three guys  Jon Orwant  Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google  saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer  and they said   This is so fun. We have to make this available for people.  So in two weeks flat    the two weeks before our paper came out    they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n gram immediately    also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears. JM  Now this was used over a million times on the first day  and this is really the best of all the queries. So people want to be their best  put their best foot forward. But it turns out in the   th century  people didn't really care about that at all. They didn't want to be their best  they wanted to be their beft. So what happened is  of course  this is just a mistake. It's not that strove for mediocrity  it's just that the S used to be written differently  kind of like an F. Now of course  Google didn't pick this up at the time  so we reported this in the science article that we wrote. But it turns out this is just a reminder that  although this is a lot of fun  when you interpret these graphs  you have to be very careful  and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. ELA  People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. Actually  we're not going to have to talk  we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. This person was interested in the history of frustration. There's various types of frustration. If you stub your toe  that's a one A  argh.  If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass  that's an eight A  aaaaaaaargh.  This person studies all the  arghs   from one through eight A's. And it turns out that the less frequent  arghs  are  of course  the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating    except  oddly  in the early   s. We think that might have something to do with Reagan. JM  There are many usages of this data  but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized. Google has started to digitize    million books. That's    percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture  there's manuscripts  there newspapers  there's things that are not text  like art and paintings. These all happen to be on our computers  on computers across the world. And when that happens  that will transform the way we have to understand our past  our present and human culture. Thank you very much. I am a reformed marketer  and I now work in international development. In October  I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo  which is the  second  largest country in Africa. In fact  it's as large as Western Europe  but it only has     miles of paved roads. The DRC is a dangerous place. In the past    years  five million people have died due to a war in the east. But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC. There are many health issues as well. In fact  the HIV prevalence rate is  .  percent among adults. This might not sound like a large number  but in a country with    million people  it means there are         that are infected. And due to the poor infrastructure  only    percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need. Which is why  in part  donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. And so while I was in the DRC  I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms  including Damien. Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa. It's a hotel that's only open until midnight  so it's not a place that you stay. But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come. Now Damien knows all about condoms  but he doesn't sell them. He said there's just not in demand. It's not surprising  because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. Joseph and Christine  who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms  said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost  and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them  their customers don't buy the branded versions. They like the generics. And as a marketer  I found that curious. And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like. And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms  fear  financing and fidelity. They name the condoms things like Vive   to live  or Trust. They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV  put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them  show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently. Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom. What is it that you think about just before you get a condom  Sex  And the private companies that sell condoms in these places  they understand this. Their marketing is slightly different. The name might not be much different  but the imagery sure is. Some brands are aspirational  and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing  understanding who's the audience. And for donor agencies  unfortunately  the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working  in . It's people back home  people that support their work  people like these. But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV  we need to think about the customer  the people whose behavior needs to change    the couples  the young women  the young men    whose lives depend on it. And so the lesson is this  it doesn't really matter what you're selling  you just have to think about who is your customer  and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior. It might just save their lives. Thank you. Everyone's familiar with cancer  but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease. The Tasmanian devil has shown us that  not only can cancer be a contagious disease  but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction. So first of all  what is a Tasmanian devil  Many of you might be familiar with Taz  the cartoon character  the one that spins around and around and around. But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil  and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial. A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo. The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes. The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger  and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.  The  Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania  which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of Australia. And despite their ferocious appearance  Tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals. In fact  growing up in Tasmania  it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a Tasmanian devil in the wild. But the Tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline. And in fact  there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within    to    years. And the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease  a contagious cancer. The story begins in      when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a Tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face. At the time  this was thought to be a one off. Animals  just like humans  sometimes get strange tumors. However  we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease  which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania. The disease was first sighted in the northeast of Tasmania in      and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave. Now there's only a small part of the population  which remains unaffected. This disease appears first as tumors  usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected Tasmanian devils. These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors  such as these ones here. And the next image I'm going to show is quite gruesome. But inevitably  these tumors progress towards being enormous  ulcerating tumors like this one here. This one in particular sticks in my mind  because this is the first case of this disease that I saw myself. And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating  foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw. She hadn't eaten for days. Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms. Her body was riddled with secondary tumors. And yet  she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils in her pouch. Of course  they died along with the mother. They were too young to survive without their mother. In fact  in the area where she comes from  more than    percent of the Tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease. Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer  this infectious cancer  that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population. And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women  which is spread by a virus  and to the AIDS epidemic  which is associated with a number of different types of cancer. All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus. However  we now know    and I'll tell you right now    that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus. In fact  the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister  and something that we hadn't really thought of before. But in order for me to explain what that is  I need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself. Cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year. One in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives. I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only   . Cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself. Paradoxically  once established  natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer. Natural selection is survival of the fittest. And when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells  if one of them acquires new mutations  which allow them to grow more quickly  acquire nutrients more successfully  invade the body  they'll be selected for by evolution. That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat. It evolves. Throw a drug at it  and resistant cells will grow back. An amazing fact is that  given the right environment and the right nutrients  a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever. However cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies  and its continued growth  its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues  leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself. So cancer could be thought of as a strange  short lived  self destructive life form    an evolutionary dead end. But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation. And the answer came from studying the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA. This was work from many people  but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that I did a few years ago. The next slide is going to be gruesome. This is Jonas. He's a Tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face. And being a geneticist  I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations. So I took this opportunity to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body. I took these back to the lab. I extracted DNA from them. And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA  and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor to that of the rest of his body  I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile. In fact  Jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you. What this told us was that Jonas' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body. In fact  more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in Jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil    and Jonas was clearly a male. So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on Jonas' face  Well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers from all around Tasmania. We found that all of these cancers shared the same DNA. Think about that for a minute. That means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil  that have broken free of that first devil's body and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population. But how can a cancer spread in a population  Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild. They tend to bite each other  often quite ferociously and usually on the face. We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor  get into the saliva. When the devil bites another devil  it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil  so the tumor continues to grow. So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer. It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it. It spreads through the population  has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system  and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction. But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils  why hasn't it happened in other animals or even humans  Well the answer is  it has. This is Kimbo. He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya. Last year  his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region. She took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting. And if you're squeamish  please look away now. He discovered this  a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis. The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor  a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs. And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells  so is this dog cancer. But this dog cancer is quite remarkable  because it spread all around the world. And in fact  these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City  in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia. We also believe this cancer might be very old. In fact  genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old  which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals. This cancer is remarkable. It's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of. It's a living relic of the distant past. So we've seen that this can happen in animals. Could cancers be contagious between people  Well this is a question which fascinated Chester Southam  a cancer doctor in the     s. Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else. And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in      injecting cancer into a volunteer  who in this case was an inmate in Ohio State Penitentiary. Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells. But a small number of them did  and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill    whose immune systems were probably compromised. What this tells us  ethical issues aside  is that ... it's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people. However  under some circumstances  it can happen. And I think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future. So just finally  cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments. But that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer. In fact  I believe  given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth  we can defeat cancer. My personal aim is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer. Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer. Thank you. So I just want to tell you my story. I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace. And naturally  I encounter a lot of resistance  because it's considered to be anti intellectual and counter to serious learning. But I have a problem with that belief  because I know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems. So I was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is. So I discovered some very interesting things. For example  there's no such thing as a flattering definition of a doodle. In the   th century  a doodle was a simpleton or a fool    as in Yankee Doodle. In the   th century  it became a verb  and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone. In the   th century  it was a corrupt politician. And today  we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition  at least to me  which is the following  To doodle officially means to dawdle  to dilly dally  to monkey around  to make meaningless marks  to do something of little value  substance or import  and    my personal favorite    to do nothing. No wonder people are averse to doodling at work. Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work  it's totally inappropriate. Additionally  I've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them  of course  for doodling in classrooms. And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom. There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling in settings in which we are supposed to learn something. And unfortunately  the press tends to reinforce this norm when they're reporting on a doodling scene    of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like    they typically use words like  discovered  or  caught  or  found out   as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed. And additionally  there is a psychological aversion to doodling    thank you  Freud. In the     s  Freud told us all that you could analyze people's psyches based on their doodles. This is not accurate  but it did happen to Tony Blair at the Davos Forum in       when his doodles were  of course   discovered  and he was labeled the following things. Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle. And Bill  if you're here  nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal. But that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles. And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe. I think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling. And I'm not comfortable with that. And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst  I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth. And here's the truth  doodling is an incredibly powerful tool  and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re learn. So here's a new definition for doodling. And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary  because I want to talk to you later. Here's the real definition  Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think. That is why millions of people doodle. Here's another interesting truth about the doodle  People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non doodling counterparts. We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus  but in reality  it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus. Additionally  it has a profound effect on creative problem solving and deep information processing. There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions. They are visual  auditory  reading and writing and kinesthetic. Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it  we have to engage at least two of those modalities  or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience. The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience. That is a pretty solid contribution for a behavior equated with doing nothing. This is so nerdy  but this made me cry when I discovered this. So they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children  and they found that  across space and time  all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow. In other words  they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order. And I think that is incredible. I think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct. And finally  a lot a people aren't privy to this  but the doodle is a precursor to some of our greatest cultural assets. This is but one  this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi. So here is my point  Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room. On the contrary  doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations where information density is very high and the need for processing that information is very high. And I will go you one further. Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form  it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy. My friends  the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought. In reality  it is one of its greatest allies. Thank you. A few months ago  a    year old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live  and she was brought in confused. Her blood pressure was an alarming     over    . Within a few minutes  she went into cardiac collapse. She was resuscitated  stabilized  whisked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room  because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung. And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung  but it showed bilateral  visible  palpable breast masses  breast tumors  that had metastasized widely all over the body. And the real tragedy was  if you look through her records  she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years. Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses  touch the breast mass  intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her. Ladies and gentlemen  that is not an unusual story. Unfortunately  it happens all the time. I joke  but I only half joke  that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb  no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan  MRI or orthopedic consult. I am not a Luddite. I teach at Stanford. I'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology. But I'd like to make the case to you in the next    minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam  when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient  we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable  early stage  but we're losing much more than that. We're losing a ritual. We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative  transcendent  and is at the heart of the patient physician relationship. This may actually be heresy to say this at TED  but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation  I think  in medicine to come in the next    years  and that is the power of the human hand    to touch  to comfort  to diagnose and to bring about treatment. I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize. This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Since we're in Edinburgh  I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle. You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh  and his character  Sherlock Holmes  was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell. Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts. And Conan Doyle  writing about Bell  described the following exchange between Bell and his students. So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department  students all around him  patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in. And a woman comes in with a child  and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange. The woman says   Good Morning.  Bell says   What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland   She says   It was good.  And he says   What did you do with the other child   She says   I left him with my sister at Leith.  And he says   And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary   She says   I did.  And he says   Would you still be working at the linoleum factory   And she says   I am.  And Bell then goes on to explain to the students. He says   You see  when she said  'Good morning ' I picked up her Fife accent. And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland. And so she must have taken the ferry over. You notice that the coat she's carrying is too small for the child who is with her  and therefore  she started out the journey with two children  but dropped one off along the way. You notice the clay on the soles of her feet. Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh  except in the botanical gardens. And therefore  she took a short cut down Inverleith Row to arrive here. And finally  she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand  a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.  And when Bell actually strips the patient  begins to examine the patient  you can only imagine how much more he would discern. And as a teacher of medicine  as a student myself  I was so inspired by that story. But you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way  using our senses  is quite recent. The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger who  in the late     s  discovered percussion. And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper. And his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder. And so when Auenbrugger became a physician  he began to do the same thing. He began to tap on the chests of his patients  on their abdomens. And basically everything we know about percussion  which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day    organ enlargement  fluid around the heart  fluid in the lungs  abdominal changes    all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript  Inventum Novum    New Invention   which would have disappeared into obscurity  except for the fact that this physician  Corvisart  a famous French physician    famous only because he was physician to this gentleman    Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work. And it was followed a year or two later by Laennec discovering the stethoscope. Laennec  it is said  was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick. One was scratching at the end of the stick  another child listened at the other end. And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called  the cylinder.  Later he renamed it the stethoscope. And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born. So within a few years  in the late     s  early     s  all of a sudden  the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis. If you'll recall  prior to that time  no matter what ailed you  you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you  bleeding you  purging you. And  oh yes  if you wanted  he would give you a haircut    short on the sides  long in the back    and pull your tooth while he was at it. He made no attempt at diagnosis. In fact  some of you might well know that the barber pole  the red and white stripes  represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon  and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected. But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change  a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body. And this particular painting  I think  represents the pinnacle  the peak  of that clinical era. This is a very famous painting   The Doctor  by Luke Fildes. Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate  who then established the Tate Gallery. And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance. And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic. Fildes' oldest son  Philip  died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness. And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two  three nights  that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time    almost a tribute to this physician. And hence the painting  The Doctor   a very famous painting. It's been on calendars  postage stamps in many different countries. I've often wondered  what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era  in the year       Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient  I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer. I call it the iPatient. The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America. The real patient often wonders  where is everyone  When are they going to come by and explain things to me  Who's in charge  There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care. I want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when I was in training. The focus was around the patient. We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge. Too often these days  rounds look very much like this  where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient. The discussion is all about images on the computer  data. And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient. Now I've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that I want to share with you. One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer  had a small breast cancer detected    had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived. This is when I was in Texas. And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care. And she found the place and decided to go there  went there. Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town  getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist. And I pressed her  and I asked her   Why did you come back and get your care here   And she was reluctant to tell me. She said   The cancer center was wonderful. It had a beautiful facility  giant atrium  valet parking  a piano that played itself  a concierge that took you around from here to there. But   she said   but they did not touch my breasts.  Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts. They had her scanned inside out. They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level  they had no need to touch her breasts. But to her  it mattered deeply. It was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who  every time she went  examined both breasts including the axillary tail  examined her axilla carefully  examined her cervical region  her inguinal region  did a thorough exam. And to her  that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed. I was very influenced by that anecdote. I was also influenced by another experience that I had  again  when I was in Texas  before I moved to Stanford. I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue. This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy. I say that because these are difficult patients. They have often been rejected by their families  have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them. And I learned very early on with my first patient that I could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of    minutes. There was just no way. And if I tried  I'd disappoint them. And so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit  and I tried not to interrupt them. We know the average American physician interrupts their patient in    seconds. And if I ever get to heaven  it will be because I held my piece for    minutes and did not interrupt my patient. I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence  and when the patient came for the physical  I was able to do a thorough physical  because I had nothing else to do. I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam  but because the whole visit was now about the physical  I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam. And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit. And I began my ritual. I always begin with the pulse  then I examine the hands  then I look at the nail beds  then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node  and I was into my ritual. And when my ritual began  this very voluble patient began to quiet down. And I remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and I had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which I had a role and the patient had a role. And when I was done  the patient said to me with some awe   I have never been examined like this before.  Now if that were true  it's a true condemnation of our health care system  because they had been seen in other places. I then proceeded to tell the patient  once the patient was dressed  the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions  which is   This is not in your head. This is real. The good news  it's not cancer  it's not tuberculosis  it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection. The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this  but here's what you should do  here's what we should do.  And I would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere. And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor  the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness  it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination. Something of importance had transpired in the exchange. I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story. And they immediately said to me   Well you are describing a classic ritual.  And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation. We marry  for example  with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss. I'm not sure why you're laughing. That was the original intent  was it not  We signal transitions of power with rituals. We signal the passage of a life with rituals. Rituals are terribly important. They're all about transformation. Well I would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi  and then  incredibly on top of that  disrobing and allowing touch    I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance. And if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient  by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown  by not doing a complete exam  you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient physician relationship. I am a writer  and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote that has to do very much with this scene. I'm an infectious disease physician  and in the early days of HIV  before we had our medications  I presided over so many scenes like this. I remember  every time I went to a patient's deathbed  whether in the hospital or at home  I remember my sense of failure    the feeling of I don't know what I have to say  I don't know what I can say  I don't know what I'm supposed to do. And out of that sense of failure  I remember  I would always examine the patient. I would pull down the eyelids. I would look at the tongue. I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart. I would feel the abdomen. I remember so many patients  their names still vivid on my tongue  their faces still so clear. I remember so many huge  hollowed out  haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual. And then the next day  I would come  and I would do it again. And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient.  I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin  unable to speak  his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications. When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth  his hands moved as if in slow motion. And as I wondered what he was up to  his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt  fumbling with his buttons. I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker basket chest to me. It was an offering  an invitation. I did not decline. I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest. I think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him. Neither of us could skip this ritual  which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung  or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure. No  this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients. Although  God knows  of late  in our hubris  we seem to have drifted away. We seem to have forgotten    as though  with the explosion of knowledge  the whole human genome mapped out at our feet  we are lulled into inattention  forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician  necessary for the patient    forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient. And the message  which I didn't fully understand then  even as I delivered it  and which I understand better now is this  I will always  always  always be there. I will see you through this. I will never abandon you. I will be with you through the end.  Thank you very much. What I want to talk about today is one idea. It's an idea for a new kind of school  which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work. And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon. Where it comes from is an organization called the Young Foundation  which  over many decades  has come up with many innovations in education  like the Open University and things like Extended Schools  Schools for Social Entrepreneurs  Summer Universities and the School of Everything. And about five years ago  we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the U.K. And we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems. One was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn't like school  couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs. And employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work  didn't have the right attitudes and experience. And so we try to ask  What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in  not fighting to stay out  And after hundreds of conversations with teenagers and teachers and parents and employers and schools from Paraguay to Australia  and looking at some of the academic research  which showed the importance of what's now called non cognitive skills    the skills of motivation  resilience    and that these are as important as the cognitive skills    formal academic skills    we came up with an answer  a very simple answer in a way  which we called the Studio School. And we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance where work and learning are integrated. You work by learning  and you learn by working. And the design we came up with had the following characteristics. First of all  we wanted small schools    about          pupils       to    year olds  and critically  about    percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms  but through real life  practical projects  working on commission to businesses  NGO's and others. That every pupil would have a coach  as well as teachers  who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business. And all of this will be done within the public system  funded by public money  but independently run. And all at no extra cost  no selection  and allowing the pupils the route into university  even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well. Underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things  they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real    all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does. Now that was a nice idea  so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase. We tried it out  first in Luton    famous for its airport and not much else  I fear    and in Blackpool    famous for its beaches and leisure. And what we found    and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them    but we found that the young people loved it. They found it much more motivational  much more exciting than traditional education. And perhaps most important of all  two years later when the exam results came through  the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top    in fact  pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of GCSE's  which is the British marking system. Now not surprisingly  that influenced some people to think we were onto something. The minister of education down south in London described himself as a  big fan.  And the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real life work today. And indeed  the head of the Chambers of Commerce is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust and helping it  not just with big businesses  but small businesses all over the country. We started with two schools. That's grown this year to about   . And next year  we're expecting about    schools open across England  and another    areas want to have their own schools opening    a pretty rapid spread of this idea. Interestingly  it's happened almost entirely without media coverage. It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it. It spread almost entirely through word of mouth  virally  across teachers  parents  people involved in education. And it spread because of the power of an idea    so the very  very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal  things like working in teams  doing practical projects  and putting them right at the heart of learning  rather than on the edges. Now there's a whole set of new schools opening up this autumn. This is one from Yorkshire where  in fact  my nephew  I hope  will be able to attend it. And this one is focused on creative and media industries. Other ones have a focus on health care  tourism  engineering and other fields. We think we're onto something. It's not perfect yet  but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands  possibly millions  of teenagers who are really bored by schooling. It doesn't animate them. They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour. They want to do things  they want to get their hands dirty  they want education to be for real. And my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us. We feel we're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the Studio School idea into something which is present  not as a universal answer for every child  but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world. And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen. Thank you very much. I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana  West Africa. Ghana felt safe to me as a child. I was free  I was happy. The early   s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana. But then by the end of the decade  the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement. In       I witnessed my first military coup. We the children had gathered at a friend's house. It was a dimly lit shack. There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background  and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole. The firing squad aimed  fired    the general was dead. Now this was being broadcast live. And shortly after  we left the country  and we returned to Switzerland. Now Europe came as a shock to me  and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in. I wanted to blend in like a chameleon. I think it was a tactic of survival. And it worked  or so I believed. So here I was in      wondering where I was in my life. And I felt I was being typecast as an actor. I was always playing the exotic African. I was playing the violent African  the African terrorist. And I was thinking  how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself  And I had become ashamed of the other  the African in me. And fortunately I decided in      to return to Ghana  after    years of absence. I wanted to document on film the      presidential elections. And there  I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood. And before I even knew it  I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally. And I realized that  when I'd left the country  free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned  that dream had become reality  though a fragile reality. And I was thinking  was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity  Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me  And it was as if through the standards of my Western life  I hadn't lived up to my full potential. I mean  nor had Ghana  even though we had been trying very hard. Now in       Ghana was the first sub Saharan country to gain its independence. In the late   s  Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP. I mean  today  Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not. But maybe it was time to prove to myself  yes  it's important to understand the past  it is important to look at it in a different light  but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present. So here I was  December  th      . The polling stations opened to the voters at      AM  but voters  eager to take their own political fate into their hands  were starting to line up at      AM in the morning. And they had traveled from near  they had traveled from far  because they wanted to make their voices heard. And I asked one of the voters  I said   Whom are you going to vote for   And he said   I'm sorry  I can't tell you.  He said that his vote was in his heart. And I understood  this was their election  and they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them. Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner    so nobody had achieved the absolute majority    so voting went into a second round three weeks later. The candidates were back on the road  they were campaigning. The rhetoric of the candidates  of course  changed. The heat was on. And then the cliche came to haunt us. There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations  of ballot boxes being stolen. Inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control. We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets. People were being beaten brutally. The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling. It was complete chaos. And my heart sank  because I thought  here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that  I am documenting it    documenting my own cultural shortcomings. So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered  it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob  and I didn't believe what I was hearing. They were chanting   We want peace. We want peace.  And I realized it had to come from the people. After all  they decide  and they did. So the sounds that were before distorted and loud  were suddenly a melody. The sounds of the voices were harmonious. So it could happen. A democracy could be upheld peacefully. It could be  by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace. Now here's an interesting comparison. We in the West  we preach the values  the golden light of democracy  that we are the shining example of how it's done. But when it comes down to it  Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the      presidential elections    Bush versus Gore. But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide  Ghana honored democracy and its people. It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide  the people did. Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either. I mean  it was so incredibly close. The electoral commissioner declared  with the consent of the parties  to run an unprecedented second re run. So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president  not the legal system. And guess what  it worked. The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle. I mean  at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy  they did not abuse their power. The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep  proving that the African is capable of governing himself. Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over  but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists  and that we must not take it for granted. Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa  and I'm still searching for my identity  but I saw Ghana create democracy better. Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes  we Africans can. Thank you. So I'm a doctor  but I kind of slipped sideways into research  and now I'm an epidemiologist. And nobody really knows what epidemiology is. Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you. And it's best understood through example as the science of those crazy  wacky newspaper headlines. And these are just some of the examples. These are from the Daily Mail. Every country in the world has a newspaper like this. It has this bizarre  ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer. So here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently  divorce  Wi Fi  toiletries and coffee. Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer  crusts  red pepper  licorice and coffee. So already you can see there are contradictions. Coffee both causes and prevents cancer. And as you start to read on  you can see that maybe there's some kind of political valence behind some of this. So for women  housework prevents breast cancer  but for men  shopping could make you impotent. So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this. And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims  unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims  isn't a kind of nasty carping activity  it's socially useful  but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool. Because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else's position. That's what happens in academic journals. That's what happens at academic conferences. The Q A session after a post op presents data is often a blood bath. And nobody minds that. We actively welcome it. It's like a consenting intellectual S M activity. So what I'm going to show you is all of the main things  all of the main features of my discipline    evidence based medicine. And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work  exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong. So we'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man  and that is authority. In science  we don't care how many letters you have after your name. In science  we want to know what your reasons are for believing something. How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us  But we're also unimpressed by authority  because it's so easy to contrive. This is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith Ph.D  or  to give her full medical title  Gillian McKeith. Again  every country has somebody like this. She is our TV diet guru. She has massive five series of prime time television  giving out very lavish and exotic health advice. She  it turns out  has a non accredited correspondence course Ph.D. from somewhere in America. She also boasts that she's a certified professional member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants  which sounds very glamorous and exciting. You get a certificate and everything. This one belongs to my dead cat Hetti. She was a horrible cat. You just go to the website  fill out the form  give them      and it arrives in the post. Now that's not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot. She also goes and says things like  you should eat lots of dark green leaves  because they contain lots of chlorophyll  and that will really oxygenate your blood. And anybody who's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight  and it's quite dark in your bowels after you've eaten spinach. Next  we need proper science  proper evidence. So   Red wine can help prevent breast cancer.  This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K.  A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer.  So you go and find this paper  and what you find is it is a real piece of science. It is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere. And that's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper  but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine  it tells you absolutely bugger all. Actually  it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink. So what we want is studies in real human people. And here's another example. This is from Britain's leading diet and nutritionist in the Daily Mirror  which is our second biggest selling newspaper.  An Australian study in      found that olive oil in combination with fruits  vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings.  And then they give you advice   If you eat olive oil and vegetables  you'll have fewer skin wrinkles.  And they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper. So you go and find the paper  and what you find is an observational study. Obviously nobody has been able to go back to       get all the people born in one maternity unit  and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil  and then half of them eat McDonald's  and then we see how many wrinkles you've got later. You have to take a snapshot of how people are now. And what you find is  of course  people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles. But that's because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil  they're freaks  they're not normal  they're like you  they come to events like this. They are posh  they're wealthy  they're less likely to have outdoor jobs  they're less likely to do manual labor  they have better social support  they're less likely to smoke    so for a whole host of fascinating  interlocking social  political and cultural reasons  they are less likely to have skin wrinkles. That doesn't mean that it's the vegetables or the olive oil. So ideally what you want to do is a trial. And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial. Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible    Daniel     . It's very straightforward    you take a bunch of people  you split them in half  you treat one group one way  you treat the other group the other way  and a little while later  you follow them up and see what happened to each of them. So I'm going to tell you about one trial  which is probably the most well reported trial in the U.K. news media over the past decade. And this is the trial of fish oil pills. And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children. And they said   We've done a trial. All the previous trials were positive  and we know this one's gonna be too.  That should always ring alarm bells. Because if you already know the answer to your trial  you shouldn't be doing one. Either you've rigged it by design  or you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore. So this is what they were going to do in their trial. They were taking       children  they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills  six of them a day  and then a year later  they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn't had the pills. Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design  And no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question. So there's no control  there's no control group. But that sounds really techie. That's a technical term. The kids got the pills  and then their performance improved. What else could it possibly be if it wasn't the pills  They got older. We all develop over time. And of course  also there's the placebo effect. The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine. It's not just about taking a pill  and your performance and your pain getting better. It's about our beliefs and expectations. It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment. And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another. So we know  for example  that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers than one sugar pill. Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day. And that's an outrageous and ridiculous finding  but it's true. We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill  taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it    not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body  but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention. So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated  which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo    where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo. But that's not enough. What I've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes. What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices  but slightly more sophisticated versions of them  in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients  and which we use to make vitally important decisions. So firstly  trials against placebo  everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo. But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong. Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available  so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing. We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have. And yet  repeatedly  you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo. And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing  which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision. But that's not the only way you can rig your data. You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish. You can give the competing drug in too low a dose  so that people aren't properly treated. You can give the competing drug in too high a dose  so that people get side effects. And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.    years ago  a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects. So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs  but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses       milligrams a day of haloperidol. And it's a foregone conclusion  if you give a drug at that high a dose  that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better.    years ago  history repeated itself  interestingly  when risperidone  which was the first of the new generation antipscyhotic drugs  came off copyright  so anybody could make copies. Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone  so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day. Again  not an insane dose  not an illegal dose  but very much at the high end of normal. And so you're bound to make your new drug look better. And so it's no surprise that overall  industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials. But    and it's a big but    it turns out  when you look at the methods used by industry funded trials  that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials. And yet  they always manage to to get the result that they want. So how does this work  How can we explain this strange phenomenon  Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action  it's withheld from doctors and patients. And this is the most important aspect of the whole story. It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence. We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective. And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action. You can use statistics  or you can use stories. I personally prefer statistics  so that's what I'm going to do first. This is something called funnel plot. And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared  have gone missing in action. So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment. And as you go up towards the top of the graph  what you see is each dot is a trial. And as you go up  those are the bigger trials  so they've got less error in them. So they're less likely to be randomly false positives  randomly false negatives. So they all cluster together. The big trials are closer to the true answer. Then as you go further down at the bottom  what you can see is  over on this side  the spurious false negatives  and over on this side  the spurious false positives. If there is publication bias  if small negative trials have gone missing in action  you can see it on one of these graphs. So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared. This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias. And I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear. That's how you can prove it statistically  but what about stories  Well they're heinous  they really are. This is a drug called reboxetine. This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients. And I'm a very nerdy doctor. I hope I try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature. I read the trials on this. They were all positive. They were all well conducted. I found no flaw. Unfortunately  it turned out  that many of these trials were withheld. In fact     percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients. Now if you think about it  if I tossed a coin a hundred times  and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times  then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads. If we remove half of the data  we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is. And this is not an isolated story. Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld  but it goes way beyond that. The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together. The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown. And they need to have access to all of the trial data. But the companies withheld that data from them  and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years. This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution. And to show how big it goes  this is a drug called Tamiflu  which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on. And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu. We already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours. But I don't really care about that. Governments don't care about that. I'm very sorry if you have the flu  I know it's horrible  but we're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day. We prescribe these drugs  we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications  which means pneumonia and which means death. The infectious diseases Cochrane Group  which are based in Italy  has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not  and they've not been able to get that information. This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today. We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information. So it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion. But I would say this  I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant. All of these things are happening in plain sight  and they're all protected by a force field of tediousness. And I think  with all of the problems in science  one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid  finger around in the mechanics and peer in. Thank you very much. What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure  wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in     . The musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this. Every single bead  every single colored band  represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. I find weather extremely fascinating. Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. So I use sculpture and music to make it  not just visible  but also tactile and audible. All of my work begins very simple. I extract information from a specific environment using very low tech data collecting devices    generally anything I can find in the hardware store. I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet    satellite images  weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. That's both historical as well as real data. And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. These clipboards are filled with numbers. And from all of these numbers  I start with only two or three variables. That begins my translation process. My translation medium is a very simple basket. A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements  I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. I use natural reed  because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. That means that it is the numbers that control the form  not me. What I come up with are forms like these. These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. Every colored bead  every colored string  represents a weather element. And together  these elements  not only construct the form  but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph. When you step closer  you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. So all the way around  you have a    hour timeline. But it's also used to assign a temperature range. On that grid  I can then weave the high tide readings  water temperature  air temperature and Moon phases. I also translate weather data into musical scores. And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. So all of these scores are made up of weather data. Every single color  dot  every single line  is a weather element. And together  these variables construct a score. I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. This is the      Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Meanwhile  I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this  that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization  but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score  so it can actually be read as a musical score. What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art  versus science. This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. You place it in an art museum  it becomes a sculpture. You place it in a science museum  it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data. You place it in a music hall  it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. And I really like that  because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. So for me  that was my way into it. Thank you. You all know the truth of what I'm going to say. I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution. What's changed is we now can look at the evidence  we can compare societies  more and less equal societies  and see what inequality does. I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist. But first  see what a miserable lot we are. I want to start though with a paradox. This shows you life expectancy against gross national income    how rich countries are on average. And you see the countries on the right  like Norway and the USA  are twice as rich as Israel  Greece  Portugal on the left. And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all. There's no suggestion of a relationship there. But if we look within our societies  there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society. This  again  is life expectancy. These are small areas of England and Wales    the poorest on the right  the richest on the left. A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us. Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top. So income means something very important within our societies  and nothing between them. The explanation of that paradox is that  within our societies  we're looking at relative income or social position  social status    where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us. And as soon as you've got that idea  you should immediately wonder  what happens if we widen the differences  or compress them  make the income differences bigger or smaller  And that's what I'm going to show you. I'm not using any hypothetical data. I'm taking data from the U.N.    it's the same as the World Bank has    on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies. The measure we've used  because it's easy to understand and you can download it  is how much richer the top    percent than the bottom    percent in each country. And you see in the more equal countries on the left    Japan  Finland  Norway  Sweden    the top    percent are about three and a half  four times as rich as the bottom    percent. But on the more unequal end    U.K.  Portugal  USA  Singapore    the differences are twice as big. On that measure  we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies. Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies. We collected data on problems with social gradients  the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder. Internationally comparable data on life expectancy  on kids' maths and literacy scores  on infant mortality rates  homicide rates  proportion of the population in prison  teenage birthrates  levels of trust  obesity  mental illness    which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction    and social mobility. We put them all in one index. They're all weighted equally. Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things. And there  you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you  which I shall use over and over again in the data. The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems. It's an extraordinarily close correlation. But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita  gross national income  there's nothing there  no correlation anymore. We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence  so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well being. It has    different components put together by other people. It contains whether kids can talk to their parents  whether they have books at home  what immunization rates are like  whether there's bullying at school. Everything goes into it. Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality. Kids do worse in the more unequal societies. Highly significant relationship. But once again  if you look at that measure of child well being  in relation to national income per person  there's no relationship  no suggestion of a relationship. What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing. The average well being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth. That's very important in poorer countries  but not in the rich developed world. But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much. I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index. Here  for instance  is trust. It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted. It comes from the World Values Survey. You see  at the more unequal end  it's about    percent of the population who feel they can trust others. But in the more equal societies  it rises to    or    percent. And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital  very similar relationships closely related to inequality. I may say  we did all this work twice. We did it first on these rich  developed countries  and then as a separate test bed  we repeated it all on the    American states    asking just the same question  do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures  So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality. Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust. Same thing is going on. Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the    states in that separate test bed. We're not just talking about a fluke. This is mental illness. WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society. This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year. And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that    whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others. And again  closely related to inequality. This is violence. These red dots are American states  and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces. But look at the scale of the differences. It goes from    homicides per million up to    . This is the proportion of the population in prison. There's a about a tenfold difference there  log scale up the side. But it goes from about    to     people in prison. That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime. In some places  that's part of it. But most of it is about more punitive sentencing  harsher sentencing. And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty. Here we have children dropping out of high school. Again  quite big differences. Extraordinarily damaging  if you're talking about using the talents of the population. This is social mobility. It's actually a measure of mobility based on income. Basically  it's asking  do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons  or is there no relationship between the two  And at the more unequal end  fathers' income is much more important    in the U.K.  USA. And in Scandinavian countries  fathers' income is much less important. There's more social mobility. And as we like to say    and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here    if Americans want to live the American dream  they should go to Denmark. I've shown you just a few things in italics here. I could have shown a number of other problems. They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient. But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries    not just a little bit worse  but anything from twice as common to    times as common. Think of the expense  the human cost of that. I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points. One is that  in graph after graph  we find the countries that do worse  whatever the outcome  seem to be the more unequal ones  and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan. So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality. It's not just one or two things that go wrong  it's most things. The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that  if you look at the bottom  Sweden and Japan  they're very different countries in all sorts of ways. The position of women  how closely they keep to the nuclear family  are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world. But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality. Sweden has huge differences in earnings  and it narrows the gap through taxation  general welfare state  generous benefits and so on. Japan is rather different though. It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax. It has lower taxes. It has a smaller welfare state. And in our analysis of the American states  we find rather the same contrast. There are some states that do well through redistribution  some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax. So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality  as long as you get there somehow. I am not talking about perfect equality  I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies. Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality. There seems to be some truth in John Donne's  No man is an island.  And in a number of studies  it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy. This is just one example. It's infant mortality. Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification. And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations  so single parents go on their own. But then where it says  low social class   that's unskilled manual occupations. It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle  then the junior non manual  going up high to the professional occupations    doctors  lawyers  directors of larger companies. You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy. The biggest differences are at the bottom of society. But even at the top  there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society. We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally. And that seems to be the general picture    that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom  but has some benefits even at the top. But I should say a few words about what's going on. I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality. More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority  of being valued and devalued  respected and disrespected. And of course  those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society. It also leads to status insecurity. We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others  whether we're regarded as attractive  clever  all that kind of thing. The social evaluative judgments increase  the fear of those social evaluative judgments. Interestingly  some parallel work going on in social psychology  some people reviewed     different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones  their responses to doing stressful tasks  measured. And in the review  what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol  the central stress hormone. And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social evaluative threat    threats to self esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance. Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress. Now we have been criticized. Of course  there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising. I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data  we never pick and choose data. We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at  it goes into the analysis. Our data source decides whether it's reliable data  we don't. Otherwise that would introduce bias. What about other countries  There are     studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer reviewed journals. This isn't confined to these countries here  hiding a very simple demonstration. The same countries  the same measure of inequality  one problem after another. Why don't we control for other factors  Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference. And of course  others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on. What about causality  Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality. We spend a good bit of time. And indeed  people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes. The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system  the cardiovascular system. Or for instance  the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on. I should say that to deal with this  we've got to deal with the post tax things and the pre tax things. We've got to constrain income  the bonus culture incomes at the top. I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can. I think the take home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us. Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well being of whole societies  and that's exciting. Thank you. Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. I last did a TED Talk I think about seven years ago or so. I talked about spaghetti sauce. And so many people  I guess  watch those videos. People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce  which is a wonderful thing in the short term    but it's proven to be less than ideal over seven years. And so I though I would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me. The theme of this morning's session is Things We Make. And so I thought I would tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era. And the man's name is Carl Norden. Carl Norden was born in     . And he was Swiss. And of course  the Swiss can be divided into two general categories  those who make small  exquisite  expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small  exquisite  expensive objects. And Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp. He's an engineer. He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich. In fact  one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin who would go on to break small  expensive  exquisite objects. And he's a Swiss engineer  Carl. And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word. He wears three piece suits  and he has a very  very small  important mustache  and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego  and he works    hour days  and he has very strong feelings about alternating current  and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness  and he drinks lots of coffee  and he does his best work sitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule. In any case  Carl Norden emigrates to the United States just before the First World War and sets up shop on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan. And he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane. Now if you think about it  in the age before GPS and radar  that was obviously a really difficult problem. It's a complicated physics problem. You've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air  going at hundreds of miles an hour  and you're trying to drop an object  a bomb  towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments. And all sorts of people  moving up to the First World War and between the wars  tried to solve this problem  and nearly everybody came up short. The bombsights that were available were incredibly crude. But Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code. And he comes up with this incredibly complicated device. It weighs about    lbs. It's called the Norden Mark    bombsight. And it has all kinds of levers and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges. And he makes this complicated thing. And what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier take this particular object  visually sight the target  because they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber  and then they plug in the altitude of the plane  the speed of the plane  the speed of the wind and the coordinates of the target. And the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb. And as Norden famously says   Before that bombsight came along  bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more.  But he said  with the Mark    Norden bombsight  he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft. Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight. It was like manna from heaven. Here was an army that had just had experience in the First World War  where millions of men fought each other in the trenches  getting nowhere  making no progress  and here someone had come up with a device that allowed them to fly up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy. And the U.S. military spends  .  billion dollars    billion dollars in      dollars    developing the Norden bombsight. And to put that in perspective  the total cost of the Manhattan project was three billion dollars. Half as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era. And there were people  strategists  within the U.S. military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the Nazis and against the Japanese. And for Norden as well  this device had incredible moral importance  because Norden was a committed Christian. In fact  he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention  because in his eyes  only God could invent things. He was simply the instrument of God's will. And what was God's will  Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible. And what did the Norden bombsight do  Well it allowed you to do that. It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb. So in the years leading up to the Second World War  the U.S. military buys        of these Norden bombsights at a cost of         each    again  in      dollars  that's a lot of money. And they trained        bombardiers on how to use them    long extensive  months long training sessions    because these things are essentially analog computers  they're not easy to use. And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath  to swear that if they're ever captured  they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy  because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology. And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane  it's escorted there by a series of armed guards. And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it. And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards. It's never allowed to be photographed. And there's a little incendiary device inside of it  so that  if the plane ever crashes  it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it. The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail. So what happens during the Second World War  Well  it turns out it's not the Holy Grail. In practice  the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at        ft.  but that's under perfect conditions. And of course  in wartime  conditions aren't perfect. First of all  it's really hard to use    really hard to use. And not all of the people who are of those        men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer. Secondly  it breaks down a lot. It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings  and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle. Thirdly  when Norden was making his calculations  he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes. Well in a real war  you can't do that  you'll get shot down. So they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds. And the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well under those conditions. But most of all  the Norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target. But of course  what happens in real life  There are clouds  right. It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate. Well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above Central Europe between      and       Not a lot. And then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was  there was a famous case in      where the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna  Germany. And the chemical plant comprised     acres. And over the course of    bombing missions  the Allies dropped        bombs on this     acre chemical plant  using the Norden bombsight. Well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the     acre perimeter of the plant     percent.    percent. And of those    percent that landed     percent didn't even go off  they were duds. The Leuna chemical plant  after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war  was up and running within weeks. And by the way  all those precautions to keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis  Well it turns out that Carl Norden  as a proper Swiss  was very enamored of German engineers. So in the     s  he hired a whole bunch of them  including a man named Hermann Long who  in       gave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis. So they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war    which also  by the way  didn't work very well. So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight  Well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of Norden bombsights. We live in a time where there are all kinds of really  really smart people running around  saying that they've invented gadgets that will forever change our world. They've invented websites that will allow people to be free. They've invented some kind of this thing  or this thing  or this thing that will make our world forever better. If you go into the military  you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well. If you go to the Pentagon  they will say   You know what  now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at        ft.  And you know what  it's true  they actually can do that now. But we need to be very clear about how little that means. In the Iraq War  at the beginning of the first Iraq War  the U.S. military  the air force  sent two squadrons of F   E Fighter Eagles to the Iraqi desert equipped with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor. And their mission was to find and to destroy    remember the Scud missile launchers  those surface to air missiles that the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis  The mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers. And so they flew missions day and night  and they dropped thousands of bombs  and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge. And after the war was over  there was an audit done    as the army always does  the air force always does    and they asked the question  how many Scuds did we actually destroy  You know what the answer was  Zero  not a single one. Now why is that  Is it because their weapons weren't accurate  Oh no  they were brilliantly accurate. They could have destroyed this little thing right here from        ft. The issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were. The problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel  it's knowing how to find the pickle barrel. That's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars. Or take the battle in Afghanistan. What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan  It's the drone. What is the drone  Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark    bombsight. It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision. And over the course of the last six years in Northwest Pakistan  the CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles  and it's used those drones to kill       suspected Pakistani and Taliban militants. Now what is the accuracy of those drones  Well it's extraordinary. We think we're now at    percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes.    percent of the people we kill need to be killed  right  That is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare. But do you know what the crucial thing is  In that exact same period that we've been using these drones with devastating accuracy  the number of attacks  of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks  against American forces in Afghanistan has increased tenfold. As we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them  they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us. I have not described to you a success story. I've described to you the opposite of a success story. And this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make. We think the things we make can solve our problems  but our problems are much more complex than that. The issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have  it's how you use the bombs you have  and more importantly  whether you ought to use bombs at all. There's a postscript to the Norden story of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight. And that is  on August          a B    bomber called the Enola Gay flew over Japan and  using a Norden bombsight  dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of Hiroshima. And as was typical with the Norden bombsight  the bomb actually missed its target by     ft. But of course  it didn't matter. And that's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the Norden bombsight. the air force's  .  billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb  which didn't need a bombsight at all. Meanwhile  back in New York  no one told Carl Norden that his bombsight was used over Hiroshima. He was a committed Christian. He thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war. It would have broken his heart. I moved to Boston    years ago  from Chicago  with an interest in cancer and in chemistry. You might know that chemistry is the science of making molecules    or to my taste  new drugs for cancer. And you might also know that  for science and medicine  Boston is a bit of a candy store. You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge without hitting a graduate student. The bar is called the Miracle of Science. The billboards say  Lab Space Available.  And it's fair to say that in these    years  we've witnessed absolutely the start of a scientific revolution    that of genome medicine. We know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before. And we're able  finally  to answer the question that's been so pressing for so many years  why do I have cancer  This information is also pretty staggering. You might know that  so far in just the dawn of this revolution  we know that there are perhaps        unique mutations affecting more than        genes  and that there are     of these genes that are bona fide drivers  causes of cancer. Yet comparatively  we have about a dozen targeted medications. And this inadequacy of cancer medicine really hit home when my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We didn't fly him to Boston. We didn't sequence his genome. It's been known for decades what causes this malignancy. It's three proteins    Ras  Myc and P  . This is old information we've known since about the   s  yet there's no medicine I can prescribe to a patient with this or any of the numerous solid tumors caused by these three horsemen of the apocalypse that is cancer. There's no Ras  no Myc  no P   drug. And you might fairly ask  why is that  And the very unsatisfying  yet scientific  answer is it's too hard. That for whatever reason  these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that's called the undruggable genome    which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the Moon unwalkable. It's a horrible term of trade. But what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins  into which we  like molecular locksmiths  can fashion an active  small  organic molecule or drug substance. Now as I was training in clinical medicine and hematology and oncology and stem cell transplantation  what we had instead  cascading through the regulatory network at the FDA  were these substances    arsenic  thalidomide and this chemical derivative of nitrogen mustard gas. And this is the   st century. And so  I guess you'd say  dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines  I went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source  the crowd source  the collaborative network that we have access to within academia  that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients. And so please consider this a work in progress  but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma  about the protein target  the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer  called BRD   and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute called JQ   which we affectionately named for Jun Qi  the chemist that made this molecule. Now BRD  is an interesting protein. You might ask yourself  with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient  how does it remember it's cancer  When it winds up its genome  divides into two cells and unwinds again  why does it not turn into an eye  into a liver  as it has all the genes necessary to do this  It remembers that it's cancer. And the reason is that cancer  like every cell in the body  places little molecular bookmarks  little Post it notes  that remind the cell  I'm cancer  I should keep growing.  And those Post it notes involve this and other proteins of its class    so called bromodomains. So we developed an idea  a rationale  that perhaps  if we made a molecule that prevented the Post it note from sticking by entering into the little pocket at the base of this spinning protein  then maybe we could convince cancer cells  certainly those addicted to this BRD  protein  that they're not cancer. And so we started to work on this problem. We developed libraries of compounds and eventually arrived at this and similar substances called JQ . Now not being a drug company  we could do certain things  we had certain flexibilities  that I respect that a pharmaceutical industry doesn't have. We just started mailing it to our friends. I have a small lab. We thought we'd just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves. And we sent it to Oxford  England where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture  which helped us understand exactly how this molecule is so potent for this protein target. It's what we call a perfect fit of shape complimentarity  or hand in glove. Now this is a very rare cancer  this BRD  addicted cancer. And so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at Brigham Women's Hospital. And as we treated these cells with this molecule  we observed something really striking. The cancer cells  small  round and rapidly dividing  grew these arms and extensions. They were changing shape. In effect  the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell. This got us very excited. The next step would be to put this molecule into mice. The only problem was there's no mouse model of this rare cancer. And so at the time that we were doing this research  I was caring for a    year old firefighter from Connecticut who was very much at the end of life with this incurable cancer. This BRD  addicted cancer was growing throughout his left lung  and he had a chest tube in that was draining little bits of debris. And every nursing shift we would throw this material out. And so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us. Could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug  Well that would be impossible and  rightly  illegal to do in humans. And he obliged us. At the Lurie Family Center for Animal Imaging  my colleague  Andrew Kung  grew this cancer successfully in mice without ever touching plastic. And you can see this PET scan of a mouse    what we call a pet PET. The cancer is growing as this red  huge mass in the hind limb of this animal. And as we treat it with our compound  this addiction to sugar  this rapid growth  faded. And on the animal on the right  you see that the cancer was responding. We've completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease. And every time  we see the same thing. The mice with this cancer that get the drug live  and the ones that don't rapidly perish. So we started to wonder  what would a drug company do at this point  Well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance. And so we did just the opposite. We published a paper that described this finding at the earliest prototype stage. We gave the world the chemical identity of this molecule  typically a secret in our discipline. We told people exactly how to make it. We gave them our email address  suggesting that  if they write us  we'll send them a free molecule. We basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible. And this was  unfortunately  successful. Because now when we've shared this molecule  just since December of last year  with    laboratories in the United States and    more in Europe    many of them pharmaceutical companies seeking now to enter this space  to target this rare cancer that  thankfully right now  is quite desirable to study in that industry. But the science that's coming back from all of these laboratories about the use of this molecule has provided us insights that we might not have had on our own. Leukemia cells treated with this compound turn into normal white blood cells. Mice with multiple myeloma  an incurable malignancy of the bone marrow  respond dramatically to the treatment with this drug. You might know that fat has memory. Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you. And in fact  this molecule prevents this adipocyte  this fat stem cell  from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet  like the folks in my hometown of Chicago  fail to develop fatty liver  which is a major medical problem. What this research taught us    not just my lab  but our institute  and Harvard Medical School more generally    is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery    that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other  never made one of its own. For all the reasons you see listed here  we think there's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest  conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery. So what next  We have this molecule  but it's not a pill yet. It's not orally available. We need to fix it  so that we can deliver it to our patients. And everyone in the lab  especially following the interaction with these patients  feels quite compelled to deliver a drug substance based on this molecule. It's here where I have to say that we could use your help and your insights  your collaborative participation. Unlike a drug company  we don't have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into. We don't have a team of salespeople and marketeers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other. What we do have is the flexibility of an academic center to work with competent  motivated  enthusiastic  hopefully well funded people to carry these molecules forward into the clinic while preserving our ability to share the prototype drug worldwide. This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called Tensha Therapeutics. And really this is the fourth of these molecules to kind of graduate from our little pipeline of drug discovery  two of which    a topical drug for lymphoma of the skin  an oral substance for the treatment of multiple myeloma    will actually come to the bedside for first clinical trial in July of this year. For us  a major and exciting milestone. I want to leave you with just two ideas. The first is if anything is unique about this research  it's less the science than the strategy    that this for us was a social experiment  an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be. This string of letters and numbers and symbols and parentheses that can be texted  I suppose  or Twittered worldwide  is the chemical identity of our pro compound. It's the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies  the information on how these early prototype drugs might work. Yet this information is largely a secret. And so we seek really to download from the amazing successes of the computer science industry two principles  that of opensource and that of crowdsourcing to quickly  responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer. Now the business model involves all of you. This research is funded by the public. It's funded by foundations. And one thing I've learned in Boston is that you people will do anything for cancer    and I love that. You bike across the state. You walk up and down the river. I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research. And so I want to thank you for your participation  your collaboration and most of all for your confidence in our ideas. I am a papercutter. I cut stories. So my process is very straightforward. I take a piece of paper  I visualize my story  sometimes I sketch  sometimes I don't. And as my image is already inside the paper  I just have to remove what's not from that story. So I didn't come to papercutting in a straight line. In fact  I see it more as a spiral. I was not born with a blade in my hand. And I don't remember papercutting as a child. As a teenager  I was sketching  drawing  and I wanted to be an artist. But I was also a rebel. And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs. So among them  I have been a shepherdess  a truck driver  a factory worker  a cleaning lady. I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico  one year in Egypt. I moved for two years in Taiwan. And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide. And I still worked as a tour leader  traveled back and forth in China  Tibet and Central Asia. So of course  it took time  and I was nearly     and I decided it's time to start as an artist. I chose papercutting because paper is cheap  it's light  and you can use it in a lot of different ways. And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient. And it's also just getting to the essential of things. So the word  silhouette  comes from a minister of finance  Etienne de Silhouette. And he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn't afford paintings anymore  and they needed to have their portrait  a la silhouette.  So I made series of images  cuttings  and I assembled them in portfolios. And people told me    like these    views of the Empire State building    they told me   You're making artist books.  So artist books have a lot of definitions. They come in a lot of different shapes. But to me  they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story. They can be with words or without words. And I have a passion for images and for words. I love pun and the relation to the unconscious. I love oddities of languages. And everywhere I lived  I learned the languages  but never mastered them. So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages. So as you can guess  my mother tongue is French. And my daily language is English. So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English. So one of these works is the  Spelling Spider.  So the Spelling Spider is a cousin of the spelling bee. But it's much more connected to the Web. And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet. So you can read  architecture active  or  active architecture.  So this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives. So if you don't know one of these languages  it's instant learning. And one ancient form of the book is scrolls. So scrolls are very convenient  because you can create a large image on a very small table. So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image  so it makes a very freestyle architecture. And I'm making all those kinds of windows. So it's to look beyond the surface. It's to have a look at different worlds. And very often I've been an outsider. So I want to see how things work and what's happening. So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit. And I revisit this world thinking about the image or clich  about what we want to do  and what are the words  colloquialisms  that we have with the expressions. It's all if. So what if we were living in balloon houses  It would make a very uplifting world. And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet. It would be so light. So sometimes I view from the inside  like EgoCentriCity and the inner circles. Sometimes it's a global view  to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams. And we can use them also as a safety net. And my inspirations are very eclectic. I'm influenced by everything I read  everything I see. I have some stories that are humorous  like  Dead Beats.  Other ones are historical. Here it's  CandyCity.  It's a non sugar coated history of sugar. It goes from slave trade to over consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between. And sometimes I have an emotional response to news  such as the      Haitian earthquake. Other times  it's not even my stories. People tell me their lives  their memories  their aspirations  and I create a mindscape. I channel their history  so that  they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities. I call them Freudian cities. I cannot speak for all my images  so I'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title.  ModiCity.   ElectriCity.   MAD Growth on Columbus Circle.   ReefCity.   A Web of Time.   Chaos City.   Daily Battles.   FeliCity.   Floating Islands.  And at one point  I had to do  The Whole Nine Yards.  So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long. So in life and in papercutting  everything is connected. One story leads to another. I was also interested in the physicality of this format  because you have to walk to see it. And parallel to my cutting is my running. I started with small images  I started with a few miles. Larger images  I started to run marathons. Then I went to run   K  then   K. Then I ran    miles    ultramarathons. And I still feel I'm running  it's just the training to become a long distance papercutter. And running gives me a lot of energy. Here is a three week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. The result is  Hells and Heavens.  It's two panels    ft. high. They were installed in the museum on two floors  but in fact  it's a continuous image. And I call it  Hells and Heavens  because it's daily hells and daily heavens. There is no border in between. Some people are born in hells  and against all odds  they make it to heavens. Other people make the opposite trip. That's the border. You have sweatshops in hells. You have people renting their wings in the heavens. And then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action  and the result puts you in hells or in heavens. So the whole  Hells and Heavens  is about free will and determinism. And in papercutting  you have the drawing as the structure itself. So you can take it off the wall. Here it's an artist book installation called  Identity Project.  It's not autobiographical identities. They are more our social identities. And then you can just walk behind them and try them on. So it's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity. That's another artist book project. In fact  in the picture  you have two of them. It's one I'm wearing and one that's on exhibition at the Center for Books Arts in New York City. Why do I call it a book  It's called  Fashion Statement   and there are quotes about fashion  so you can read it  and also  because the definition of artist book is very generous. So artist books  you take them off the wall. You take them for a walk. You can also install them as public art. Here it's in Scottsdale  Arizona  and it's called  Floating Memories.  So it's regional memories  and they are just randomly moved by the wind. I love public art. And I entered competitions for a long time. After eight years of rejection  I was thrilled to get my first commission with the Percent for Art in New York City. It was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen. I made an artist book that's in stainless steel instead of paper. I called it  Working in the Same Direction.  But I added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions. With public art  I could also make cut glass. Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx. And each time I make public art  I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed. So for the subway in New York  I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading. It is travel in time  travel on time. And Bronx literature  it's all about Bronx writers and their stories. Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose  California. So I made a vegetable point of view of the growth of San Jose. So I started in the center with the acorn for the Ohlone Indian civilization. Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers. And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today. And it's still growing. So the technique  it's cut  sandblasted  etched and printed glass into architectural glass. And outside the library  I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind. I took library material that had fruit in their title and I used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge. I also planted the bibliotree. So it's a tree  and in its trunk you have the roots of languages. And it's all about international writing systems. And on the branches you have library material growing. You can also have function and form with public art. So in Aurora  Colorado it's a bench. But you have a bonus with this bench. Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts  you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs. Another functional work  it's in the south side of Chicago for a subway station. And it's called  Seeds of the Future are Planted Today.  It's a story about transformation and connections. So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter  and not to have objects falling on the rails. To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers  it's fantastic. And here I've been working for the last three years with a South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing. So each building has its own personality. And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood  like in Morrisania  about the jazz history. And for other projects  like in Paris  it's about the name of the street. It's called Rue des Prairies    Prairie Street. So I brought back the rabbit  the dragonfly  to stay in that street. And in       I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year. So that was a very captive audience. And I wanted to give them an escape. I created  All Around Town.  It is a papercutting  and then after  I added color on the computer. So I can call it techno crafted. And along the way  I'm kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques. But the result is always to have stories. So the stories  they have a lot of possibilities. They have a lot of scenarios. I don't know the stories. I take images from our global imagination  from clich   from things we are thinking about  from history. And everybody's a narrator  because everybody has a story to tell. But more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world. And in all these universes  it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with  but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic. And it's what story cutting is all about. Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist. And usually when I tell people I'm an artist  they just look at me and say   Do you paint   or  What kind of medium do you work in   Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique. So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving. And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago. So let me show you a little of that. So it started over here. And this is the Detroit airport in June   th of     . I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas. And as I was coming back  well I was taken by the FBI  met by an FBI agent  and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions     Where were you  What were you doing  Who were you talking with  Why were you there  Who pays for your trips      all these little details. And then literally just out of nowhere  the guy asks me   Where were you September   th   And when most of us get asked   Where were you September   th   or any date for that fact  it's like   I don't exactly remember  but I can look it up for you.  So I pulled out my little PDA  and I said   Okay  let's look up my appointments for September   th.  I had September   th    from       a.m. to       a.m.  I paid my storage bill. From       a.m. to       p.m.  I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time. From       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my intro class       p.m. to      p.m.  I taught my advanced class.  Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th    Where were you the   th  the   th    Where were you October  th   We read about six months of my calendar. And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did. But good thing I did  because I don't look good in orange. So he asked me     So this storage unit that you paid the rent on  what did you have in it   This was in Tampa  Florida  so I was like   Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida. Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment. Just assorted garage sale junk  because I'm a pack rat.  And he looks at me really confused and says   No explosives   I was like   No  no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives. And if there were  I would have remembered that one.  And he's still a little confused  but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat. And so we're sitting there  and eventually after about an hour  hour and a half of just going back and forth  he says   Okay  I have enough information here. I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this. They'll follow up with you  and we'll take care of it.  I was like   Great.  So I got home and the phone rings  and a man introduced himself. Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life    back and forth  not six months continuously. By the way  you folks know that in the United States  you can't take photographs of federal buildings  but Google can do it for you. So to the folks from Google  thank you. So I spent a lot of time in this building. Questions like   Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation   And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this. You're basically face to face with someone that essentially decides life or death. Or questions such as    actually  during the polygraph  which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them    one of the polygraph questions was ... well the first one was   Is your name Hasan    Yes.   Are we in Florida    Yes.   Is today Tuesday    Yes.  Because you have to base it on a yes or no. Then  of course  the next question is   Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I work at a university. So I was like   Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly.  But they said   Okay  aside from what we had discussed  do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States   I was like   No.  So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs  they said   Hey  everything's fine.  I was like   I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along. I know everything's fine.  So they're looking at me really odd. And it's like   Guys  I travel a lot.  This is with the FBI. And I was like   All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo  and here we go all over again.  And there was a sincere concern there. And he was like   You know  if you get into trouble  give us a call    we'll take care of it.  So ever since then  before I would go anywhere  I would call the FBI. I would tell them   Hey guys  this is where I'm going. This is my flight. Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March   th  or whatever. A couple weeks later  I'd call again  let them know. It wasn't that I had to  but I chose to. Just wanted to say   Hey guys. Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves.   I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee. Just letting you know. Heads up.  And so I just kept doing this over and over and over. And then the phone calls turned into emails  and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... with pictures  with travel tips. Then I'd make websites. And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here. So I actually designed this back in     . So this kind of tracks me at any given moment. I wrote some code for my mobile phone. Basically  what I decided is okay guys  you want to watch me  that's cool. But I'll watch myself. It's okay. You don't have to waste your energy or your resources. And I'll help you out. So in the process  I start thinking  well what else might they know about me  Well they probably have all my flight records  so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online. So you can see  Delta      going from Kansas City to Atlanta. And then you see  these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes. This was on Delta     going from JFK to San Francisco. See that  They won't let me on a plane with that  but they'll give it to me on the plane. These are the airports that I hang out in  because I like airports. That's Kennedy airport  May   th  Tuesday. This is in Warsaw. Singapore. You can see  they're kind of empty. These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone. But if you can cross reference this with the other data  then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together. And when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence  you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner. At the time that this was going on  the last thing on my mind was  art project.  I was certainly not thinking  hey  I got new work here. But after going through this  after realizing  well what just happened  And after piecing together this  this and this  this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this  and it actually became this project. So these are the stores that I shop in    some of them    because they need to know. This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch    in Daly City on Sunday  November   th. At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi. And I bought some crabs too right around there  and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville. And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland    East Oakland  sorry. And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route    in East Brunswick. Now if you go to my bank records  it'll actually show something from there  so you know that  on May  th  that I bought    .   in fuel from Safeway Vallejo. So not only that I'm giving this information here and there  but now there's a third party  an independent third party  my bank  that's verifying that  yes indeed  I was there at this time. So there's points  and these points are actually being cross referenced. And there's a verification taking place. Sometimes they're really small purchases. So    cents foreign transaction fee. All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts  and everything pops up right away. Sometimes there's a lot of information. This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was. And then sometimes you get this. Sometimes you just get this  just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City  January   nd. And I can tell you exactly who I was with  where I was  because this is what I had to do with the FBI. I had to tell them every little detail of everything. I spend a lot of time on the road. This is a parking lot in Elko  Nevada off of Route    at      p.m. on August   th. I spend a lot of time in gas stations too    empty train stations. So there's multiple databases. And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images. There's actually        images right now on my site  and the FBI has seen all of them    at least I trust they've seen all of them. And then sometimes you don't get much information at all  you just get this empty bed. And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information. So you get something like this. This  by the way  is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California    Vietnamese sandwich. So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations  empty gas stations. These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home. So how do you know these are meals eaten at home  Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times. So again  you have to do some detective work here. So sometimes the databases get so specific. These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth. At       a.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. At      p.m. was this one. So I time stamp my life every few moments. Every few moments I shoot the image. Now it's all done on my iPhone  and it all goes straight up to my server  and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together. They need to know where I'm doing my business  because they want to know about my business. So on December  th  I went here. And on Sunday  June   th at         this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan  Maine    this was my apartment there. So what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information. If you go to my site  there's tons of things. And really  it's not the most user friendly interface. It's actually quite user unfriendly. And one of the reasons  also being part of the user unfriendliness  is that everything is there  but you have to really work through it. So by me putting all this information out there  what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything. But in this barrage of noise that I'm putting out  I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life. And you know very little about me actually. And really so I've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy  particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded  there's no need to delete information anymore. So what do you do when everything is out there  Well you have to take control over it. And if I give you this information directly  it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces. The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies    and it doesn't matter who they are    they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information  or restricted access to information. And the reason their information has any value is  well  because no one else has access to it. And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you  the information that the FBI has has no value  so thus devaluing their currency. And I understand that  on an individual level  it's purely symbolic. But if     million people in the U.S. started doing this  we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up. Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything. And we're getting to that. When I first started this project  people were looking at me and saying   Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing  where you're at  Why are you posting these photos   This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and     million people were posting status messages or poking people. So in a way  I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete. I'm still doing this project  but it is obsolete  because you're all doing it. This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis  whether we're aware of it or not. So we're creating our own archives and so on. And you know  some of my friends have always said   Hey  you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this  Because no one's really watching. No one's really going to bother you.  So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully. Because it's about surveillance. I'm watching who's watching me. And I came up with these. So these are some of my sample logs. And just little bits and pieces  and you can see some of the things there. And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see. So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by    Department of Homeland Security. You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by. I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now. Central Intelligence Agency. Executive Office of the President. Not really sure why they show up  but they do. I think they kind of like to look at art. And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields. So thank you very much. I appreciate it. Bruno Giussani  Hasan  just curious. You said   Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone   but actually you do take the pictures and put on information. So how many hours of the day does that take  HE  Almost none. It's no different than sending a text. It's no different than checking an email. It's one of those things  we got by just fine before we had to do any of those. So it's just become another day. I mean  when we update a status message  we don't really think about how long that's going to take. So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks  send  and then it's done. And everything's automated at the other end. BG  On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage  the FBI gets crazy  HE  Well it goes to the last point that I was at. So it holds onto the very last point. So if I'm on a    hour flight  you'll see the last airport that I departed from. BG  Hasan  thank you very much.  HE  Thank you.  The night before I was heading for Scotland  I was invited to host the final of  China's Got Talent  show in Shanghai with the        live audience in the stadium. Guess who was the performing guest  Susan Boyle. And I told her   I'm going to Scotland the next day.  She sang beautifully  and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese      So it's not like  hello  or  thank you   that ordinary stuff. It means  green onion for free.  Why did she say that  Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle    a    some year old woman  a vegetable vendor in Shanghai  who loves singing Western opera  but she didn't understand any English or French or Italian  so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese. And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was  green onion for free.  So  as  Susan Boyle was saying that         live audience sang together. That was hilarious. So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness. They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment  yet their courage and talent brought them through. And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams. Well  being different is not that difficult. We are all different from different perspectives. But I think being different is good  because you present a different point of view. You may have the chance to make a difference. My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past        years. I remember that in the year of       when I was graduating from college  I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five star hotel in Beijing  Great Wall Sheraton    it's still there. So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour  he finally said   So  Miss Yang  do you have any questions to ask me   I summoned my courage and poise and said   Yes  but could you let me know  what actually do you sell   I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about in a five star hotel. That was the first day I set my foot in a five star hotel. Around the same time  I was going through an audition    the first ever open audition by national television in China    with another thousand college girls. The producer told us they were looking for some sweet  innocent and beautiful fresh face. So when it was my turn  I stood up and said   Why  do  women's personalities on television always have to be beautiful  sweet  innocent and  you know  supportive  Why can't they have their own ideas and their own voice   I thought I kind of offended them. But actually  they were impressed by my words. And so I was in the second round of competition  and then the third and the fourth. After seven rounds of competition  I was the last one to survive it. So I was on a national television prime time show. And believe it or not  that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script. And my weekly audience at that time was between     to     million people. Well after a few years  I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies  and then started my own media company  which was unthought of during the years that I started my career. So we do a lot of things. I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past. And sometimes I have young people approaching me say   Lan  you changed my life   and I feel proud of that. But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country. I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games. I was representing the Shanghai Expo. I saw China embracing the world and vice versa. But then sometimes I'm thinking  what are today's young generation up to  How are they different  and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China  or at large  the world  So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media. First of all  who are they   What  do they look like  Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei       years old  beautiful. She showed off her expensive bags  clothes and car on her microblog  which is the Chinese version of Twitter. And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce. She didn't realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning  almost a turmoil  against the credibility of Red Cross. The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it  and the investigation is going on. So far  as of today  we know that she herself made up that title    probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity. All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend  who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce. It's very complicated to explain. But anyway  the public still doesn't buy it. It is still boiling. It shows us a general mistrust of government or government backed institutions  which lacked transparency in the past. And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog. Microblog boomed in the year of       with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled. Sina.com  a major news portal  alone has more than     million microbloggers. On Tencent      million. The most popular blogger    it's not me    it's a movie star  and she has more than  .  million followers  or fans. About    percent of those microbloggers are young people  under    years old. And because  as you know  the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government  social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. But because you don't have many other openings  the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong  active and even violent. So through microblogging  we are able to understand Chinese youth even better. So how are they different  First of all  most of them were born in the   s and   s  under the one child policy. And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls  now we have ended up with    million more young men than women. That could pose a potential danger to the society  but who knows  we're in a globalized world  so they can look for girlfriends from other countries. Most of them have fairly good education. The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent. In cities     percent of kids go to college. But they are facing an aging China with a population above    years old coming up with seven point some percent this year  and about to be    percent by the year of     . And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially  and taking care of them when they're sick. So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of    years old. So making a living is not that easy for young people. College graduates are not in short supply. In urban areas  college graduates find the starting salary is about     U.S. dollars a month  while the average rent is above     . So what do they do  They have to share space    squeezed in very limited space to save money    and they call themselves  tribe of ants.  And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment  they figured out they have to work for    to    years to afford their first apartment. That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn  but in China it's    to    years with the skyrocketing real estate price. Among the     million migrant workers     percent of them are young people. They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas. Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside  but they don't have the sense of belonging. They work for longer hours with less income  less social welfare. And they're more vulnerable to job losses  subject to inflation  tightening loans from banks  appreciation of the renminbi  or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce. Last year  though  an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China     young workers in their late teens and early   s committed suicide  just one by one like causing a contagious disease. But they died because of all different personal reasons. But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation  both physical and mental  of these migrant workers. For those who do return back to the countryside  they find themselves very welcome locally  because with the knowledge  skills and networks they have learned in the cities  with the assistance of the Internet  they're able to create more jobs  upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market. So for the past few years  the coastal areas  they found themselves in a shortage of labor. These diagrams show a more general social background. The first one is the Engels coefficient  which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade  in terms of family income  to about    some percent. But then in the last two years  it goes up again to    percent  indicating a rising living cost. The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of  . . Now it's  .     even worse than that in America    showing us the income inequality. And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility. And also  the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest. So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging  we can see what young people care most about. Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand. For the past decade or so  a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property. And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation. Sometimes people get killed  and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest. So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet  people cry for the government to take actions to stop this. So the good news is that earlier this year  the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court. Similarly  many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet. We heard about polluted air  polluted water  poisoned food. And guess what  we have faked beef. They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish  and it turns it to look like beef. And then lately  people are very concerned about cooking oil  because thousands of people have been found  refining  cooking oil from restaurant slop. So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet. And fortunately  we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns. While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy making  but sometimes they're a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life. China is soon to pass the U.S. as the number one market for luxury brands    that's not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere. But you know what  half of those consumers are earning a salary below       U.S. dollars. They're not rich at all. They're taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status. And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle. But of course  we do have young people who would still prefer to smile  whether in a BMW or  on  a bicycle. So in the next picture  you see a very popular phenomenon called  naked  wedding  or  naked  marriage. It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding  but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house  without a car  without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet  to show their commitment to true love. And also  people are doing good through social media. And the first picture showed us that a truck caging     homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging. People were donating money  dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck. And after hours of negotiation      dogs were rescued. And here also people are helping to find missing children. A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet. After thousands of resends in relay  the child was found  and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging. So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years. Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values  but also  it's about the environment. People are thinking about the following questions  Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP  How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth  to keep sustainability and stability  And also  how capable is the system of self correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time  I guess these are the questions people are going to answer. And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves. Thank you very much. So I have a strange career. I know it because people come up to me  like colleagues  and say   Chris  you have a strange career.  And I can see their point  because I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist. And I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions  and I was only    years old. No  no  I wasn't    years old. But after that  I actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department  and I wasn't doing any neuroscience. Later  I would work on evolutionary genetics  and I would work on systems biology. But I'm going to tell you about something else today. I'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life. And I was actually a rocket scientist. I wasn't really a rocket scientist  but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm  whereas now I'm in the mid West  and it's cold. But it was an exciting experience. One day a NASA manager comes into my office  sits down and says   Can you please tell us  how do we look for life outside Earth   And that came as a surprise to me  because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation. Yet  I had a very good answer. I said   I have no idea.  And he told me   Biosignatures  we need to look for a biosignature.  And I said   What is that   And he said   It's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life.  And I said   Really  Because isn't that easy  I mean  we have life. Can't you apply a definition  like for example  a Supreme Court like definition of life   And then I thought about it a little bit  and I said   Well  is it really that easy  Because  yes  if you see something like this  then all right  fine  I'm going to call it life    no doubt about it. But here's something.  And he goes   Right  that's life too. I know that.  Except  if you think life is also defined by things that die  you're not in luck with this thing  because that's actually a very strange organism. It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase  and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again  and then actually grows back up  and back down and back up    sort of yo yo    and it never dies. So it's actually life  but it's actually not as we thought life would be. And then you see something like that. And he was like   My God  what kind of a life form is that   Anyone know  It's actually not life  it's a crystal. So once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things    so this particular person wrote a whole article and said   Hey  these are bacteria.  Except  if you look a little bit closer  you see  in fact  that this thing is way too small to be anything like that. So he was convinced  but  in fact  most people aren't. And then  of course  NASA also had a big announcement  and President Clinton gave a press conference  about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite. Except that nowadays  it's heavily disputed. If you take the lesson of all these pictures  then you realize  well actually maybe it's not that easy. Maybe I do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction. So can life be defined  Well how would you go about it  Well of course  you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L. No  of course you don't do that  you put it somewhere in Google. And then you might get something. And what you might get    and anything that actually refers to things that we are used to  you throw away. And then you might come up with something like this. And it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts. Who on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane  Oh  it's actually a really  really  important set of concepts. So I'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to  but in fact on processes only. And if you take a look at that  this was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life. And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with. Because the idea was that  with concepts like that  maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life. And so if you go and ask yourself   What on Earth is artificial life    let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about. And it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses. And for those of you who aren't old enough  you have no idea how this infection was working    namely  through these floppy disks. But the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that  if you look at the rate at which the infection worked  they show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus. And it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth. And the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses  a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we're used to  at least on the viral level. So is that life  Not as far as I'm concerned. Why  Because these things don't evolve by themselves. In fact  they have hackers writing them. But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided   Why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve   And this was Steen Rasmussen. And he designed this system  but it really didn't work  because his viruses were constantly destroying each other. But there was another scientist who had been watching this  an ecologist. And he went home and says   I know how to fix this.  And he wrote the Tierra system  and  in my book  is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems    except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity. So having seen this work  worked a little bit on this  this is where I came in. And I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see the evolution of complexity  more and more complex problems constantly evolving. And of course  since I really don't know how to write code  I had help in this. I had two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me. That's Charles Offria on the left  Titus Brown on the right. They are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University  but I can assure you  back in the day  we were not a respectable team. And I'm really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together. But what is this system like  Well I can't really go into the details  but what you see here is some of the entrails. But what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure. There's about        programs sitting here. And all different strains are colored in different colors. And as you see here  there are groups that are growing on top of each other  because they are spreading. Any time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world  due to whatever mutation it has acquired  it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction. So I'm going to show you a movie where you're going to see that kind of dynamic. And these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves. We write our own stuff  replicate it  and are very proud of ourselves. And we put them in  and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation. By the way  this is highly accelerated  so it's like a thousand generations a second. But immediately the system goes like   What kind of dumb piece of code was this  This can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly.  So you see waves of new types taking over the other types. And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile  until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs. And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation  like this one  which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before  until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved. And this process goes on and on and on. So what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way we're used to life  going.  But what the NASA people had asked me really was   Do these guys have a biosignature  Can we measure this type of life  Because if we can  maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids.  So I said   Well  perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process. In fact  it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be.  And the thing I came up with    I have to first give you an introduction about the idea  and maybe that would be a meaning detector  rather than a life detector. And the way we would do that    I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys  as opposed to text that  is  in our books. And I would like to do it in such a way that I don't actually have to be able to read the language  because I'm sure I won't be able to. As long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet. So here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the    letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys. And obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent. But if you now look at the same distribution in English texts  it looks like that. And I'm telling you  this is very robust across English texts. And if I look at French texts  it looks a little bit different  or Italian or German. They all have their own type of frequency distribution  but it's robust. It doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science. It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text. It's a robust signature  and it's very stable. As long as our books are written in English    because people are rewriting them and recopying them    it's going to be there. So that inspired me to think about  well  what if I try to use this idea in order  not to detect random texts from texts with meaning  but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life. But first I have to ask  what are these building blocks  like the alphabet  elements that I showed you  Well it turns out  we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks. We could use amino acids  we could use nucleic acids  carboxylic acids  fatty acids. In fact  chemistry's extremely rich  and our body uses a lot of them. So that we actually  to test this idea  first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids. And here's the result. Here is  in fact  what you get if you  for example  look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or  in fact  in a laboratory  where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there. What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there's some trace elements of the other ones. That is also very robust    what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids  but there is no life. But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers  because there's bacteria all over the place  or you take water anywhere on Earth  because it's teaming with life  and you make the same analysis  the spectrum looks completely different. Of course  there is still glycine and alanine  but in fact  there are these heavy elements  these heavy amino acids  that are being produced because these are valuable to the organism. And some other ones that are not used in the set of     they will not appear at all in any type of concentration. So this also turns out to be extremely robust. It doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up  whether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals. Anywhere there's life  you're going to have this distribution  as opposed to that distribution. And it is detectable not just in amino acids. Now you could ask  well  what about these Avidians  The Avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity. So this is the distribution that you get if  in fact  there is no life. They have about    of these instructions. And if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other  it's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter. Each of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency. But if you now take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw  it looks like this. So there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms  and their frequency is going to be high. And there's actually some instructions that you only use once  if ever. So they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random. In this case  the frequency is lower. And so now we can see  is that really a robust signature  I can tell you indeed it is  because this type of spectrum  just like what you've seen in books  and just like what you've seen in amino acids  it doesn't really matter how you change the environment  it's very robust  it's going to reflect the environment. So I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did. And I have to explain to you  the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about. Here  in fact  that's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency. And below there  I show  in fact  the mutation rate in the environment. And I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that  even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world  if you drop it in  it gets mutated to death immediately. So there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate. But then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat  so to speak  and then there's this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live. And indeed  we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time. So let's see what that looks like. So first  nothing  nothing  nothing. Too hot  too hot. Now the viability threshold is reached  and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and  in fact  stabilizes. And now what I did there is  I was being nasty  I just turned up the heat again and again. And of course  it reaches the viability threshold. And I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice. You hit the viability threshold. The distribution changes to  alive   And then  once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self reproduce  you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes. And then that signature is lost. What do we learn from that  Well  I think we learn a number of things from that. One of them is  if we are able to think about life in abstract terms    and we're not talking about things like plants  and we're not talking about amino acids  and we're not talking about bacteria  but we think in terms of processes    then we could start to think about life  not as something that is so special to Earth  but that  in fact  could exist anywhere. Because it really only has to do with these concepts of information  of storing information within physical substrates    anything  bits  nucleic acids  anything that's an alphabet    and make sure that there's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information. And if you can do that  then you have life. So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone  without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear  as far as the type of life on Earth is. And that in a sense removes us again  like all of our scientific discoveries  or many of them    it's this continuous dethroning of man    of how we think we're special because we're alive. Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer. Granted  it's limited  but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it. And once we have that  then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say  if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate  then we can go out and try other worlds  figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be  figure enough about the normal chemistry  the geochemistry of the planet  so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life  and then look for large deviations from this    this thing sticking out  which says   This chemical really shouldn't be there.  Now we don't know that there's life then  but we could say   Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from.  And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it. And so that's really the only take home message that I have for you. Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets. And if we remove the mystery of life  then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live  and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are. And I'm going to leave you with that. And thank you very much. What's in the box  Whatever it is must be pretty important  because I've traveled with it  moved it  from apartment to apartment to apartment. Sound familiar  Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did    years ago  Three times. So you'd think  with all this extra space  we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff. Nope. There's a new industry in town  a    billion dollar   .  billion sq. ft. industry  that of personal storage. So we've got triple the space  but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space. So where does this lead  Lots of credit card debt  huge environmental footprints  and perhaps not coincidentally  our happiness levels flat lined over the same    years. Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way  that less might actually equal more. I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less  college    in your dorm  traveling    in a hotel room  camping    rig up basically nothing  maybe a boat. Whatever it was for you  I bet that  among other things  this gave you a little more freedom  a little more time. So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint. It's actually a great way to save you some money. And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area. First up  crowd sourcing my     sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com. I wanted it all    home office  sit down dinner for     room for guests  and all my kite surfing gear. With over     entries from around the world  I got it  my own little jewel box. By buying a space that was     sq. ft. instead of      immediately I'm saving     grand. Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities    save some more money there  but also a smaller footprint. And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions    my favorite stuff    and really designed for me  I'm really excited to be there. So how can you live little  Three main approaches. First of all  you have to edit ruthlessly. We've got to clear the arteries of our lives. And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years  It's time for me to let it go. We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives  and we've got to learn to stem the inflow. We need to think before we buy. Ask ourselves   Is that really going to make me happier  Truly   By all means  we should buy and own some great stuff. But we want stuff that we're going to love for years  not just stuff. Secondly  our new mantra  small is sexy. We want space efficiency. We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time  not that rare event. Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three  So we want things that nest  we want things that stack  and we want it digitized. You can take paperwork  books  movies  and you can make it disappear    it's magic. Finally  we want multifunctional spaces and housewares    a sink combined with a toilet  a dining table becomes a bed    same space  a little side table stretches out to seat   . In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here  we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space. Look at the coffee table    it grows in height and width to seat   . My office folds away  easily hidden. My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers. Guests  Move the moving wall  have some fold down guest beds. And of course  my own movie theater. So I'm not saying that we all need to live in     sq. ft. But consider the benefits of an edited life. Go from       to        from       to      . Most of us  maybe all of us  are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags  maybe a small space  a hotel room. So when you go home and you walk through your front door  take a second and ask yourselves   Could I do with a little life editing  Would that give me a little more freedom  Maybe a little more time   What's in the box  It doesn't really matter. I know I don't need it. What's in yours  Maybe  just maybe  less might equal more. So let's make room for the good stuff. Thank you. I'm a garbage man. And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man  because I absolutely hate waste. I hope  within the next    minutes  to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life. And I'd like to start at the very beginning. Think back when you were just a kid. How did look at the stuff in your life  Perhaps it was like these toddler rules  It's my stuff if I saw it first. The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something. The more stuff that's mine  the better. And of course  it's your stuff if it's broken. Well after spending about    years in the recycling industry  it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults. And let me tell you why I have that perspective. Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff. Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff  but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world    well less than one percent. In fact  the United Nations estimates that there's about    billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year    and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream. And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth  that number well more than doubles. And of course  the more developed the country  the bigger these mountains. Now when you see these mountains  most people think of garbage. We see above ground mines. And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place. And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams. Because as we've heard all week at TED  the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff. And of course  they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted. And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day  It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals. And the metals  we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world. And the plastics  we get from oil  which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract. And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today. The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff  particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner. Most of what's extracted from our end of life stuff  if it makes it to a recycler  are the metals. To put that in perspective    and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals  because it's the most common metal    if your stuff makes it to a recycler  probably over    percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose. Plastics are a whole other story  well less than    percent are recovered. In fact  it's more like five percent. Most of it's incinerated or landfilled. Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw away material  have very little value. But actually  plastics are several times more valuable than steel. And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel. So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material  Well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another. They have very different densities. They have different electrical and magnetic properties. And they even have different colors. So it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials. Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range. They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties. And any plastic can be any color  as you probably well know. So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics. Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world    and sadly to say  particularly from the United States  where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe    finds its way to developing countries for low cost recycling. People  for as little as a dollar a day  pick through our stuff. They extract what they can  which is mostly the metals    circuit boards and so forth    and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover  which is  again  mostly the plastics. Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here. And they extract the metals by hand. Now while this may be the low economic cost solution  this is certainly not the low environmental or human health and safety solution. I call this environmental arbitrage. And it's not fair  it's not safe and it's not sustainable. Now because the plastics are so plentiful    and by the way  those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics  obviously    but people do try to recover the plastics. This is just one example. This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai  India. They store the plastics on the roofs. They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these  and people try very hard to separate the plastics  by color  by shape  by feel  by any technique they can. And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the  burn and sniff  technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic. None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way. And by the way  please don't try this technique at home. So what are we to do about this space age material  at least what we used to call a space aged material  these plastics  Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke. So about    years ago  I literally started in my garage tinkering around  trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other  and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends  in the mining world actually  and in the plastics world  and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world. Because after all  we're doing above ground mining. And we eventually broke the code. This is the last frontier of recycling. It's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth. And we finally figured out how to do it. And in the process  we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics. The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals. You breakdown the molecules  you recombine them in very specific ways  to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day. We said  there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics. And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint  sustainable from an economic standpoint as well. Well a good place to start is with waste. It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil  and it's plentiful  as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs. And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them  we're using a mining approach to extract the materials. We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment. We have enormous energy savings. I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save    to    percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way. And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life  our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them. And we make a drop in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals. Our customers get to enjoy huge CO  savings. They get to close the loop with their products. And they get to make more sustainable products. In the short time period I have  I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this. It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits. They recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue    it's their waste    a very complex mixture of materials  but predominantly plastics. We take out the things that aren't plastics  such as the metals they missed  carpeting  foam  rubber  wood  glass  paper  you name it. Even an occasional dead animal  unfortunately. And it goes in the first part of our process here  which is more like traditional recycling. We're sieving the material  we're using magnets  we're using air classification. It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point. At the end of this process  we have a mixed plastic composite  many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics. This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process  and the really hard work  multi step separation process begins. We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail. We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics  not only by type  but by grade. And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic  one type  one grade. We then use optical sorting to color sort this material. We blend it in        lb. blending silos. We push that material to extruders where we melt it  push it through small die holes  make spaghetti like plastic strands. And we chop those strands into what are called pellets. And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry. This is the same material that you would get from oil. And today  we're producing it from your old stuff  and it's going right back into your new stuff. So now  instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke  you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products  in your office  or back at work in your home. And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic  replacing virgin plastic  to make their new products. So I hope I've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life. We took our clues from mother nature. Mother nature wastes very little  reuses practically everything. And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer    that's a label I've always hated my entire life    and think of yourself as just using resources in one form  until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time. And finally  I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to   If it's broken  it's my stuff.  Thank you for your time. I am a conductor  and I'm here today to talk to you about trust. My job depends upon it. There has to be  between me and the orchestra  an unshakable bond of trust  born out of mutual respect  through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in. Now in the old days  conducting  music making  was less about trust and more  frankly  about coercion. Up to and around about the Second World War  conductors were invariably dictators    these tyrannical figures who would rehearse  not just the orchestra as a whole  but individuals within it  within an inch of their lives. But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on  music has moved on with it. We now have a more democratic view and way of making music    a two way street. I  as the conductor  have to come to the rehearsal with a cast iron sense of the outer architecture of that music  within which there is then immense personal freedom for the members of the orchestra to shine. For myself  of course  I have to completely trust my body language. That's all I have at the point of sale. It's silent gesture. I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing. Ladies and gentlemen  the Scottish Ensemble. So in order for all this to work  obviously I have got to be in a position of trust. I have to trust the orchestra  and  even more crucially  I have to trust myself. Think about it  when you're in a position of not trusting  what do you do  You overcompensate. And in my game  that means you overgesticulate. You end up like some kind of rabid windmill. And the bigger your gesture gets  the more ill defined  blurry and  frankly  useless it is to the orchestra. You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore  only ridicule. And I remember at the beginning of my career  again and again  on these dismal outings with orchestras  I would be going completely insane on the podium  trying to engender a small scale crescendo really  just a little upsurge in volume. Bugger me  they wouldn't give it to me. I spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms. And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said   Conducting  Charles  is like holding a small bird in your hand. If you hold it too tightly  you crush it. If you hold it too loosely  it flies away.  I have to say  in those days  I couldn't really even find the bird. Now a fundamental and really viscerally important experience for me  in terms of music  has been my adventures in South Africa  the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view  but a country which  through its musical culture  has taught me one fundamental lesson  that through music making can come deep levels of fundamental life giving trust. Back in       I had the opportunity to go to South Africa to form a new opera company. So I went out there  and I auditioned  mainly in rural township locations  right around the country. I heard about       singers and pulled together a company of    of the most jaw droppingly amazing young performers  the majority of whom were black  but there were a handful of white performers. Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period that one of those white performers had  in his previous incarnation  been a member of the South African police force. And in the last years of the old regime  he would routinely be detailed to go into the township to aggress the community. Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room  the general atmosphere. Let's be under no illusions. In South Africa  the relationship most devoid of trust is that between a white policeman and the black community. So how do we recover from that  ladies and gentlemen  Simply through singing. We sang  we sang  we sang  and amazingly new trust grew  and indeed friendship blossomed. And that showed me such a fundamental truth  that music making and other forms of creativity can so often go to places where mere words cannot. So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally. One of them was  Carmen.  We then thought we'd make a movie of  Carmen   which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha. The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa  which is a beautifully musical language  if you don't know it. It's called  U Carmen e Khayelitsha     literally  Carmen of Khayelitsha.  I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making. Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free. South Africans just make music really freely. And I think  in no small way  that's due to one fundamental fact  they're not bound to a system of notation. They don't read music. They trust their ears. You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat. And then  as if by magic  they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune because they can. Now those of us that live in the West  if I can use that term  I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music    that somehow it's all about skill and systems. Therefore it's the exclusive preserve of an elite  talented body. And yet  ladies and gentlemen  every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis. And if I can broaden this out for a second  I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room would be happy to speak with acuity  with total confidence  about movies  probably about literature. But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion about a piece of classical music  Why is this  And what I'm going to say to you now is I'm just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self confidence  to take the plunge  to believe that you can trust your ears  you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue  fiber  DNA  what makes a great piece of music great. I've got a little experiment I want to try with you. Did you know that TED is a tune  A very simple tune based on three notes    T  E  D. Now hang on a minute. I know you're going to say to me   T doesn't exist in music.  Well ladies and gentlemen  there's a time honored system  which composers have been using for hundreds of years  which proves actually that it does. If I sing you a musical scale  A  B  C  D  E  F  G    and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet  same scale  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T    there you go. T  see it's the same as F in music. So T is F. So T  E  D is the same as F  E  D. Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme  which is TED. Have a listen. Do you hear it  Or do I smell some doubt in the room  Okay  we'll play it for you again now  and we're going to highlight  we're going to poke out the T  E  D. If you'll pardon the expression. Oh my goodness me  there it was loud and clear  surely. I think we should make this even more explicit. Ladies and gentlemen  it's nearly time for tea. Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea  I think  I think we need to sing for our tea. We're going to sing those three wonderful notes  T  E  D. Will you have a go for me  Audience  T  E  D. Charles Hazlewood  Yeah  you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings. Shall we try that one again  And look  if you're adventurous  you go up the octave. T  E  D. Audience  T  E  D. CH  Once more with vim.  Audience  T  E  D.  There I am like a bloody windmill again  you see. Now we're going to put that in the context of the music. The music will start  and then at a signal from me  you will sing that. One more time  with feeling  ladies and gentlemen. You won't make the key otherwise. Well done  ladies and gentlemen. It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir  not a bad debut at all. Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you  because it is all about changing perceptions  and  indeed  building a new level of trust. The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy  which as you can imagine  if you don't have an experience of it yourself  is quite a big thing to take on board. But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me  aside from her very existence  is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community that was hitherto hidden  the community of disabled people. And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt that disability is no barrier to the highest levels of sporting achievement. Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth  which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust  to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion. So I find myself asking  where is music in all of this  You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people  in the U.K. alone  with massive musical potential. So I decided to create a platform for that potential. It's going to be Britain's first ever national disabled orchestra. It's called Paraorchestra. I'm going to show you a clip now of the very first improvisation session that we had. It was a really extraordinary moment. Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians. Normally when you improvise    and I do it all the time around the world    there's this initial period of horror  like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring  an awful pregnant silence. Then suddenly  as if by magic  bang  We're all in there and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything. No one's listening. No one's trusting. No one's responding to each other. Now in this room with these four disabled musicians  within five minutes a rapt listening  a rapt response and some really insanely beautiful music. Nicholas   My name's Nicholas McCarthy. I'm     and I'm a left handed pianist. And I was born without my left hand    right hand. Can I do that one again  Lyn  When I'm making music  I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane. I become alive. Clarence  I would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk. There's so much joy and things I could get from playing an instrument and performing. It's removed some of my paralysis. CH  I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today  so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are. Paraorchestra is the name of that project. If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point  please let me know. Now my parting shot comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn  wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the   th century    spent the bulk of his life in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy  along with his orchestra. Now this prince loved his music  but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time  which is just on the Austro Hungarian border  a place called Esterhazy    a long way from the big city of Vienna. Now one day in       the prince decreed that the musicians' families  the orchestral musicians' families  were no longer welcome in the castle. They weren't allowed to stay there anymore  they had to be returned to Vienna    as I say  an unfeasibly long way away in those days. You can imagine  the musicians were disconsolate. Haydn remonstrated with the prince  but to no avail. So given the prince loved his music  Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point. And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now. And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt. I'm pleased to say  the prince did take the tip from the orchestral performance  and the musicians were reunited with their families. But I think it sums up my talk rather well  this  that where there is trust  there is music    by extension life. Where there is no trust  the music quite simply withers away. What is going on in this baby's mind  If you'd asked people this    years ago  most people  including psychologists  would have said that this baby was irrational  illogical  egocentric    that he couldn't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect. In the last    years  developmental science has completely overturned that picture. So in some ways  we think that this baby's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists. Let me give you just one example of this. One thing that this baby could be thinking about  that could be going on in his mind  is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby. After all  one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling. And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel. Anyone who's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get. We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people. Now the question is  How could we ask them  Babies  after all  can't talk  and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks  what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that. So how do we actually ask them the question  Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli. What we did    Betty Rapacholi  who was one of my students  and I    was actually to give the babies two bowls of food  one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers. Now all of the babies  even in Berkley  like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli. But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl. And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't. So half the time  she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli    just like a baby and any other sane person. But half the time  what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go   Mmmmm  broccoli. I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm.  And then she would take a little bit of the crackers  and she'd go   Eww  yuck  crackers. I tasted the crackers. Eww  yuck.  So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted. We did this with    and    month old babies. And then she would simply put her hand out and say   Can you give me some   So the question is  What would the baby give her  what they liked or what she liked  And the remarkable thing was that    month old babies  just barely walking and talking  would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers  but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli. On the other hand     month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli  like they couldn't figure this out. But then after they stared for a long time  they would just give her the crackers  what they thought everybody must like. So there are two really remarkable things about this. The first one is that these little    month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature  that we don't always want the same thing. And what's more  they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted. Even more remarkably though  the fact that    month olds didn't do this suggests that these    month olds had learned this deep  profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were    months old. So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought. And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last    years that's actually demonstrated it. The question you might ask though is  Why do children learn so much  And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time  I mean  after all  if you look at babies superficially  they seem pretty useless. And actually in many ways  they're worse than useless  because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive. But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies  it turns out that there's actually an answer. If we look across many  many different species of animals  not just us primates  but also including other mammals  birds  even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats  it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are. And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there. On one side is a New Caledonian crow. And crows and other corvidae  ravens  rooks and so forth  are incredibly smart birds. They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects. And this is a bird on the cover of science who's learned how to use a tool to get food. On the other hand  we have our friend the domestic chicken. And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps. So they're very  very good at pecking for grain  and they're not much good at doing anything else. Well it turns out that the babies  the New Caledonian crow babies  are fledglings. They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years  which is a really long time in the life of a bird. Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months. So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot. There's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning. Well what kind of explanation could we have for this  Well some animals  like the chicken  seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well. So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment. Other creatures  like the crows  aren't very good at doing anything in particular  but they're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments. And of course  we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows. We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal. We're smarter  we're more flexible  we can learn more  we survive in more different environments  we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space. And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species. My son is   . And at least until they're     we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths. All right  why would we see this correlation  Well an idea is that that strategy  that learning strategy  is an extremely powerful  great strategy for getting on in the world  but it has one big disadvantage. And that one big disadvantage is that  until you actually do all that learning  you're going to be helpless. So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself   A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better   You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up. And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor. So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected. We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn. And then as adults  we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world. So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species. So they're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas  and we're production and marketing. We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use. Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups  we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species    kind of like caterpillars and butterflies    except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring  and we're the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow  grownup  adult path. If this is true  if these babies are designed to learn    and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning  that's what they're for    we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms. And in fact  the baby's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet. But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better. And there's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently. And it all depends on the ideas of this guy  the Reverend Thomas Bayes  who was a statistician and mathematician in the   th century. And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize  describe  the way that scientists find out about the world. So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with. They go out and test it against the evidence. The evidence makes them change that hypothesis. Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth. And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that. And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now. And some    years ago  I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing. So if you want to know what's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes  I think it actually looks something like this. This is Reverend Bayes's notebook. So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they're revising to figure out how the world works. All right  now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate. Because after all  if you ask even grownups about statistics  they look extremely stupid. How could it be that children are doing statistics  So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector. This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others. And using this very simple machine  my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world. Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner  my student. If I showed you this detector  you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector. But actually  this detector works in a bit of a strange way. Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector  something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with  the detector will actually activate two out of three times. Whereas  if you do the likely thing  put the block on the detector  it will only activate two out of six times. So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence. It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy. So we did just this  we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence  and we just asked them to make it go. And sure enough  the four year olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector. Now there are two things that are really interesting about this. The first one is  again  remember  these are four year olds. They're just learning how to count. But unconsciously  they're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure. And the other interesting thing is that they're using that evidence to get to an idea  get to a hypothesis about the world  that seems very unlikely to begin with. And in studies we've just been doing in my lab  similar studies  we've show that four year olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task. So in these circumstances  the children are using statistics to find out about the world  but after all  scientists also do experiments  and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments. When children do experiments we call it  getting into everything  or else  playing.  And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program. Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab. What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors. And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't  and then she showed them an anomaly. And what you'll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes. Same as the other side. Alison Gopnik  Okay  so his first hypothesis has just been falsified. Boy  This one lighted up  and this one nothing. AG  Okay  he's got his experimental notebook out. Boy  What's making this light up. I don't know. AG  Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair. Boy  Oh  it's because this needs to be like this  and this needs to be like this. AG  Okay  hypothesis two. Boy  That's why. Oh. AG  Now this is his next idea. He told the experimenter to do this  to try putting it out onto the other location. Not working either. Boy  Oh  because the light goes only to here  not here. Oh  the bottom of this box has electricity in here  but this doesn't have electricity. AG  Okay  that's a fourth hypothesis. Boy  It's lighting up. So when you put four. So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up. AG  Okay there's his fifth hypothesis. Now that is a particularly    that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy  but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical. If you look at the way children play  when you ask them to explain something  what they really do is do a series of experiments. This is actually pretty typical of four year olds. Well  what's it like to be this kind of creature  What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes  Well  if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers  a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all. And I think just the opposite is true. I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults. Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works. And adults' attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight. So what happens for adults is we decide that something's relevant or important  we should pay attention to it. Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid  and everything else sort of goes dark. And we even know something about the way the brain does this. So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex  the sort of executive part of our brains  sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible  more plastic  better at learning  and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains. So we have a very focused  purpose driven kind of attention. If we look at babies and young children  we see something very different. I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness. So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing. But they're very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once. And if you actually look in their brains  you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity  and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet. So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention  what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention. So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important. That's the kind of attention  the kind of consciousness  that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn. Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults  I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before    when we fall in love with someone new  or when we're in a new city for the first time. And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts  it expands  so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking  talking  faculty meeting attending zombie back home. And by the way  that coffee  that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs  actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters. So what's it like to be a baby  It's like being in love in Paris for the first time after you've had three double espressos. That's a fantastic way to be  but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning. Now it's good to be a grownup. I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are. It's good to be a grownup. We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves. And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do. But if what we want is to be like those butterflies  to have open mindedness  open learning  imagination  creativity  innovation  maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children. When I was little    and by the way  I was little once    my father told me a story about an   th century watchmaker. And what this guy had done  he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches. And one day  one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought. And the guy took it apart  and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels. And as he did so  his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving  were words. And he said to the guy   Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see   And the watchmaker turned around and said   God can see it.  Now I'm not in the least bit religious  neither was my father  but at that point  I noticed something happening here. I felt something in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves  and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere  I guess. But I felt something. And it was a physiological response. And from that point on  from my age at the time  I began to think of things in a different way. And as I took on my career as a designer  I began to ask myself the simple question  Do we actually think beauty  or do we feel it  Now you probably know the answer to this already. You probably think  well  I don't know which one you think it is  but I think it's about feeling beauty. And so I then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things. One of the most early work was done in automotive design    some very exciting work was done there. And during a lot of this work  we found something  or I found something  that really fascinated me  and maybe you can remember it. Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off  click click  when you closed the door in a car  And then somebody  I think it was BMW  introduced a light that went out slowly. Remember that  I remember it clearly. Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that  I remember sitting there thinking  this is fantastic. In fact  I've never found anybody that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly. I thought  well what the hell's that about  So I started to ask myself questions about it. And the first was  I'd ask other people   Do you like it    Yes.   Why   And they'd say   Oh  it feels so natural   or   It's nice.  I thought  well that's not good enough. Can we cut down a little bit further  because  as a designer  I need the vocabulary  I need the keyboard  of how this actually works. And so I did some experiments. And I suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that    light to dark in six seconds    exactly that. Do you know what it is  Anyone  You see  using this bit  the thinky bit  the slow bit of the brain    using that. And this isn't a think  it's a feel. And would you do me a favor  For the next    minutes or whatever it is  will you feel stuff  I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it. I felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation. And that thing that I found was the cinema or the theater. It's actually just happened here    light to dark in six seconds. And when that happens  are you sitting there going   No  the movie's about to start   or are you going   That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it. I get a sense of anticipation   Now I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex. But it might be. Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere that used to go in the cinema get this. And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don't get it in the same way. Everybody likes it  but some like it more than others. So this leads me to think of this in a different way. We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system    if that's not an outmoded idea. These are the bits  the pleasure centers  and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking. The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit  the cortex. They arrive first. So how do we make that actually work  And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know  or what we're going to learn  about something  This is one of the most beautiful things I know. It's a plastic bag. And when I looked at it first  I thought  no  there's no beauty in that. Then I found out  post exposure  that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff  that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure  potable drinking water. And all of a sudden  this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me. Now I'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit. Would you mind taking the brain out  and I just want you to feel something. Look at that. What are you feeling about it  Is it beautiful  Is it exciting  I'm watching your faces very carefully. There's some rather bored looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged looking ladies who are picking up something off that. Maybe there's an innocence to it. Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready  This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi  five years old  before she died of cancer to the spine. It's the last thing she did  the last physical act. Look at that picture. Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it. Is it beautiful now  Stop. Stop. How do you feel  Where are you feeling this  I'm feeling it here. I feel it here. And I'm watching your faces  because your faces are telling me something. The lady over there is actually crying  by the way. But what are you doing  I watch what people do. I watch faces. I watch reactions. Because I have to know how people react to things. And one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty  something stupefyingly delicious  is what I call the OMG. And by the way  there's no pleasure in that face. It's not a  this is wonderful   The eyebrows are doing this  the eyes are defocused  and the mouth is hanging open. That's not the expression of joy. There's something else in that. There's something weird happening. So pleasure seems to be tempered by a whole series of different things coming in. Poignancy is a word I love as a designer. It means something triggering a big emotional response  often quite a sad emotional response  but it's part of what we do. It isn't just about nice. And this is the dilemma  this is the paradox  of beauty. Sensorily  we're taking in all sorts of things    mixtures of things that are good  bad  exciting  frightening    to come up with that sensorial exposure  that sensation of what's going on. Pathos appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing. And also triumph  this sense of transcendence  this  I never knew that. Ah  this is something new.  And that's packed in there as well. And as we assemble these tools  from a design point of view  I get terribly excited about it  because these are things  as we've already said  they're arriving at the brain  it would seem  before cognition  before we can manipulate them    electrochemical party tricks. Now what I'm also interested in is  Is it possible to separate intrinsic and extrinsic beauty  By that  I mean intrinsically beautiful things  just something that's exquisitely beautiful  that's universally beautiful. Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it. Very hard to find something that  to everybody  is a very beautiful thing  without a certain amount of information packed in there before. So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic. It's mediated by information before the comprehension. Or the information's added on at the back  like that little girl's drawing that I showed you. Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you. And one of the most tedious ones  I think  was saying that beauty was about symmetry. Well it obviously isn't. This is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people  and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then exposing a full face. And they found that it was almost exact coincidence. So it wasn't about symmetry. In fact  this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face  of which both sides are beautiful. But they're both different. And as a designer  I can't help meddling with this  so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this  and tried to understand what the individual elements were  but feeling it as I go. Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye. I'm not getting it off the eyebrow. And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all. So I don't know how much this is helping me  but it's helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off. And as I say  I'm not a neuroscientist  but to understand how I can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements. Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are  but as we are. So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you  which is beautiful to me. And this is the F  MV Agusta. Ahhhh. It is really    I mean  I can't express to you how exquisite this object is. But I also know why it's exquisite to me  because it's a palimpsest of things. It's masses and masses of layers. This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension. It's something much bigger. Layer after layer of legend  sport  details that resonate. I mean  if I just go through some of them now    I know about laminar flow when it comes to air piercing objects  and that does it consummately well  you can see it can. So that's getting me excited. And I feel that here. This bit  the big secret of automotive design    reflection management. It's not about the shapes  it's how the shapes reflect light. Now that thing  light flickers across it as you move  so it becomes a kinetic object  even though it's standing still    managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection. This little relief on the footplate  by the way  to a rider means there's something going on underneath it    in this case  a drive chain running at     miles and hour probably  taking the power from the engine. I'm getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things. Titanium lacquer on this. I can't tell you how wonderful this is. That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel. I'm really getting into this now. And of course  a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand  but this one  because it's a road bike  it all goes away and it folds into this little gap. So it disappears. And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator  which is curved. Why would you do that  Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics. So it's more expensive  but it's wonderful. And to cap it all  brand royalty    Agusta  Count Agusta  from the great histories of this stuff. The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this. Massimo Tamburini. They call him  The Plumber  in Italy  as well as  Maestro   because he actually is engineer and craftsman and sculptor at the same time. There's so little compromise on this  you can't see it. But unfortunately  the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty. We have to deal with it. So I have to work with a supply chain  and I've got to work with the technologies  and I've got to work with everything else all the time  and so compromises start to fit into it. And so look at her. I've had to make a bit of a compromise there. I've had to move that part across  but only a millimeter. No one's noticed  have they yet  Did you see what I did  I moved three things by a millimeter. Pretty  Yes. Beautiful  Maybe lesser. But then  of course  the consumer says that doesn't really matter. So that's okay  isn't it  Another millimeter  No one's going to notice those split lines and changes. It's that easy to lose beauty  because beauty's incredibly difficult to do. And only a few people can do it. And a focus group cannot do it. And a team rarely can do it. It takes a central cortex  if you like  to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time. This is a beautiful water bottle    some of you know of it    done by Ross Lovegrove  the designer. This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one  as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this. It's lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious. I might like it more than you like it  because I know how bloody hard it is to do it. It's stupefyingly difficult to make something that refracts light like that  that comes out of the tool correctly  that goes down the line without falling over. Underneath this  like the story of the swan  is a million things very difficult to do. So all hail to that. It's a fantastic example  a simple object. And the one I showed you before was  of course  a massively complex one. And they're working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it. You all  I guess  like me  enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance. And part of the joy of it is  you know the difficulty. You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful. Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes when they come out of the points  While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you  something horrible's going on down here. The comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what's actually going on. Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here  so please ignore me. But what I have to do now  feeling again  what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes  of these triggers into something early on in the process  that you pick it up  not through your thinking  but through your feeling. So we're going to have a little experiment. Right  are you ready  I'm going to show you something for a very  very brief moment. Are you ready  Okay. Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash  It's not. Tell me something  did you think it was quick when you first saw it  Yes you did. Did you think it was modern  Yes you did. That blip  that information  shot into you before that. And because your brain starter motor began there  now it's got to deal with it. And the great thing is  this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future. So is that wrong  Well in this case it isn't  because it's a very  very ecologically sound piece of technology. But you're a slave of that first flash. We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second    and that's where much of my work has to win or lose  on a shelf in a shop. It wins or loses at that point. You may see              things on a shelf as you walk down it  but I have to work within that domain  to ensure that it gets you there first. And finally  the layer that I love  of knowledge. Some of you  I'm sure  will be familiar with this. What's incredible about this  and the way I love to come back to it  is this is taking something that you hate or bores you  folding clothes  and if you can actually do this    who can actually do this  Anybody try to do this  Yeah  It's fantastic  isn't it  Look at that. Do you want to see it again  No time. It says I have two minutes left  so we can't do this. But just go to the Web  YouTube  pull it down   folding T shirt.  That's how underpaid younger aged people have to fold your T shirt. You didn't maybe know it. But how do you feel about it  It feels fantastic when you do it  you look forward to doing it  and when you tell somebody else about it    like you probably have    you look really smart. The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside  the stuff that costs nothing  because that knowledge is free    bundle that together and where do we come out  Form follows function  Only sometimes. Only sometimes. Form is function. Form is function. It informs  it tells us  it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it. And so I've stopped using words like  form   and I've stopped using words like  function  as a designer. What I try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things. Because if I can get that right  I can make them wonderful  and I can make them repeatedly wonderful. And you know what those products and services are  because you own some of them. They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire. Forming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electrochemical party trick that happens before you even think about it. Thank you very much. Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing  broadcasting  commerce and social connectivity  but where did it all come from  And I'll quote three people  Vannevar Bush  Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners Lee. So let's just run through these guys. This is Vannevar Bush. Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war. And in       he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly. And the article was called  As We May Think.  And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken. We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth. The brain works by association. With one item in its thought  it snaps instantly to the next item. And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process. And so he suggested a machine  and he called it the memex. And the memex would link information  one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth. Now this was in     . A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking. And nobody knew anything about it. So this was before the computer was invented. And he proposed this machine called the memex. And he had a platform where you linked information to other information  and then you could call it up at will. So spinning forward  one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart  and he was a U.S. Air Force officer. And he was reading it in their library in the Far East. And he was so inspired by this article  it kind of directed the rest of his life. And by the mid   s  he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California. He built a system. The system was designed to augment human intelligence  it was called. And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service  his system was called NLS for oN Line System. And this is Doug Engelbart. He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in     . What he showed    he sat on a stage like this  and he demonstrated this system. He had his head mic like I've got. And he works this system. And you can see  he's working between documents and graphics and so forth. And he's driving it all with this platform here  with a five finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse  which he specially designed in order to do this system. So this is where the mouse came from as well. So this is Doug Engelbart. The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds. So for a personal computer  a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane  it wasn't really very practical. But spin on to the   s when personal computers did arrive  then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers. And my company  OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh. And we delivered the world's first hypertext system. And this began to get a head of steam. Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard  and they made a bit of a fuss about it. They had a    page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched. The magazines started to cover it. Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext. We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version. And our PC version became quite mature. These are some examples of this system in action in the late   s. You were able to deliver documents  were able to do it over networks. We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html. We called it hml  hypertext markup language. And the system was capable of doing very  very large documentation systems over computer networks. So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November     . And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners Lee who said   Are you Ian Ritchie   and I said   Yeah.  And he said   I need to talk to you.  And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web. And I thought  well  that's got a pretentious name  especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office. But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day. And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it  because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything  it was just plain text. I thought  well  you know  interesting  but a guy from CERN  he's not going to do this. So we didn't do it. In the next couple of years  the hypertext community didn't recognize him either. In       his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference. In       there was a table at the conference in Seattle  and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web. And I saw it  and I thought  yep  that's it. And the very next year  in       we had the conference here in Edinburgh  and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners Lee as the keynote speaker. So that puts me in pretty illustrious company. There was a guy called Dick Rowe who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles. There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC  and he wasn't there  so they went back to see Bill Gates. And the    publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter  I guess. On the other hand  there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web. And according to Fortune magazine  he's worth     million dollars. But is he happy  Okay  now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room  but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar. Also  the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars  how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking  and ultimately to trust building. Now  speaking of trust  ever since I wrote this book   Liespotting   no one wants to meet me in person anymore  no  no  no  no  no. They say   It's okay  we'll email you.  I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like   Honey  deception  Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking   So before I get started  what I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you  which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids  those kids in the back of the room that are shouting   Gotcha  Gotcha  Your eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying.  No  liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth  and they do what mature leaders do everyday  they have difficult conversations with difficult people  sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition  and that proposition is the following  Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it  a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love  but look  if at some point you got lied to  it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying  Lying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity  maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret  secret. We say   Nice song.   Honey  you don't look fat in that  no.  Or we say  favorite of the digiratti   You know  I just fished that email out of my Spam folder. So sorry.  But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw     billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States. That's an eyelash under a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron  Madoff  the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors  like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames  lies can betray our country  they can compromise our security  they can undermine democracy  they can cause the deaths of those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man  Henry Oberlander  he was such an effective con man  British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google  you can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once  and he said the following. He said   Look  I've got one rule.  And this was Henry's rule  he said   Look  everyone is willing to give you something. They're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for.  And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be deceived  you have to know  what is it that you're hungry for  And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were better husbands  better wives  smarter  more powerful  taller  richer    the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were  how we wish we could be  with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day  studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from    to     times. Now granted  many of those are white lies. But in another study  it showed that strangers lied three times within the first    minutes of meeting each other. Now when we first hear this data  we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely  the plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple  you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every    interactions. Now  you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried  that number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as needed basis  sometimes for very good reasons  other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying  but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture  it's part of our history. Think Dante  Shakespeare  the Bible  News of the World. Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species  the larger the neocortex  the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language  Koko was taught to communicate via sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little  fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall. We're hardwired to become leaders of the pack. It's starts really  really early. How early  Well babies will fake a cry  pause  wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One year olds learn concealment. Two year olds bluff. Five year olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine year olds  masters of the cover up. By the time you enter college  you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners  we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam  fake digital friends  partisan media  ingenious identity thieves  world class Ponzi schemers  a deception epidemic    in short  what one author calls a post truth society. It's been very confusing for a long time now. What do you do  Well  there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth    percent of the time. The rest of us  we're only    percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn  There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie  not a single time  never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people. Thank you. Pamela Meyer  Okay  what were the telltale signs  Well first we heard what's known as a non contracted denial. Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language. We also heard distancing language   that woman.  We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject  using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said   Well  to tell you the truth ...  or Richard Nixon's favorite   In all candor ...  he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language  as it's called  qualifying language like that  further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety  or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail    and we're all really glad he didn't do that    he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said  look  there's much more to it than speech   No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent  he chatters with his fingertips.  And we all do it no matter how powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you Dominique Strauss Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. Now this brings us to our next pattern  which is body language. With body language  here's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door. Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars fidget all the time. Well guess what  they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what  they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles convey honesty  sincerity. But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here  You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes  the crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted  especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox  nobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening in a conversation  Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words and someone's actions  Now  I know it seems really obvious  but when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception  attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators. An honest person is going to be cooperative. They're going to show they're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing to brainstorm  name suspects  provide details. They're going to say   Hey  maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks.  They're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview  not just in flashes  they'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks  an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn  look down  lower their voice  pause  be kind of herky jerky. Ask a deceptive person to tell their story  they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours  they will ask that person to tell that story backwards  and then they'll watch them squirm  and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that  Well  we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words  but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say  yes   we shake our heads  no.  We tell very convincing stories  we slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes  and we smile at the delight in getting away with it. Now  that smile is known in the trade as  duping delight.  And we're going to see that in several videos moving forward  but we're going to start    for those of you who don't know him  this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him saying   yes  while shaking his head  no   slightly shrugging his shoulders. I know that it's not possible that this child could be mine  because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test  and would love to see it happen. Interviewer  Are you going to do that soon  Is there somebody    JE  Well  I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM  Okay  those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand  celebrate  go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here  but there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous and it's easy to learn  and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger  you've got two people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat of a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt  you've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason  it's very  very hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt  whether or not deception follows    and it doesn't always follow    look the other way  go the other direction  reconsider the deal  say   No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you.  Science has surfaced many  many more indicators. We know  for example  we know liars will shift their blink rate  point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone  often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long. They don't mean anything in and of themselves. But when you see clusters of them  that's your signal. Look  listen  probe  ask some hard questions  get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing  walk into curiosity mode  ask more questions  have a little dignity  treat the person you're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks on  Law   Order  and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission. Don't be too aggressive  it doesn't work. Now  we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised  we're now going to look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos  two mothers    one is lying  one is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like. This mother  Diane Downs  shot her kids at close range  drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car  claimed a scraggy haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video  she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very  very cool demeanor. And if you look closely  you'll see duping delight throughout this video. I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving  and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth. And that    maybe it'll fade too with time    but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM  Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother  Erin Runnion  confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion  just the authentic expression of a mother's agony. on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby  and you hurt her  and you crushed her  you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought  and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes  and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it  and I never will. PM  Okay  there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions. Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on  the science of it. We know  for example  that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans  MRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit  and they will prove incredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself in the meantime  Who do you want on your side of the meeting  someone who's trained in getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag a     pound electroencephalogram through the door  Liespotters rely on human tools. They know  as someone once said   Character's who you are in the dark.  And what's kind of interesting is that today  we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up    hours a day. It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember  oversharing  that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency    character integrity    that's still what matters  that's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world  it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code. When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking  listening  you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie. You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit  because you signal to everyone around you  you say   Hey  my world  our world  it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized.  And when you do that  the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. So I'm here to explain why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas. And to do that  I'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies. So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A  BPA. It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics. So BPA mimics the body's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems. And it's everywhere. A recent study found BPA in    percent of people six and older. But it's just one chemical. The Center for Disease Control in the U.S. says we have     toxic pollutants in our bodies  and this includes preservatives  pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury. To me  this says three things. First  don't become a cannibal. Second  we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution. And third  our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins. So what happens to all these toxins when we die  The short answer is  They return to the environment in one way or another  continuing the cycle of toxicity. But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse. If you're cremated  all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere. And this includes       pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year. And in a traditional American funeral  a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive. It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition    a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel. So by trying to preserve our dead bodies  we deny death  poison the living and further harm the environment. Green or natural burials  which don't use embalming  are a step in the right direction  but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies. I think there's a better solution. I'm an artist  so I'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art  science and culture. The Infinity Burial Project  an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies. The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom    a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies  clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots  leaving clean compost. But I learned it's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom. I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil. So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body. So today  I'm collecting what I shed or slough off    my hair  skin and nails    and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms. As the mushrooms grow  I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms. It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife. So when I die  the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it. All right  so for some of you  this may be really  really out there. Just a little. I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food. We want to eat  not be eaten by  our food. But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body  I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment. See for me  cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet  it's a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay. It's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet. Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture  a concept that was developed by an entomologist  Timothy Myles. The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation    the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies. And now about these ninja pajamas. Once it's completed  I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects. First  a burial suit infused with mushroom spores  the Mushroom Death Suit. I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit. It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores. The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia  which are the equivalent of plant roots. I'm also making a decompiculture kit  a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation. These capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly  a kind of second skin  which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms. So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two  and then I'd like to begin testing them  first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects. And believe it or not  a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms. What I've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment. I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms  so I formed the Decompiculture Society  a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options  seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom. The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift  from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture  a radical acceptance of death and decomposition. Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment  as the research on environmental toxins confirms. And the saying goes  we came from dust and will return to dust. And once we understand that we're connected to the environment  we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet. I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility. Thank you. I'd like to take you to another world. And I'd like to share a    year old love story with the poor  living on less than one dollar a day. I went to a very elitist  snobbish  expensive education in India  and that almost destroyed me. I was all set to be a diplomat  teacher  doctor    all laid out. Then  I don't look it  but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years. The whole world was laid out for me. Everything was at my feet. I could do nothing wrong. And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like. So in       I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India  and I saw starvation  death  people dying of hunger  for the first time. It changed my life. I came back home  told my mother   I'd like to live and work in a village.  Mother went into a coma.  What is this  The whole world is laid out for you  the best jobs are laid out for you  and you want to go and work in a village  I mean  is there something wrong with you   I said   No  I've got the best eduction. It made me think. And I wanted to give something back in my own way.   What do you want to do in a village  No job  no money  no security  no prospect.  I said   I want to live and dig wells for five years.   Dig wells for five years  You went to the most expensive school and college in India  and you want to dig wells for five years   She didn't speak to me for a very long time  because she thought I'd let my family down. But then  I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have  which are never brought into the mainstream    which is never identified  respected  applied on a large scale. And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College    college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college. I went to this village for the first time. Elders came to me and said   Are you running from the police   I said   No.   You failed in your exam   I said   No.   You didn't get a government job   I said   No.   What are you doing here  Why are you here  The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich  what are you doing in this village  Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us   I said   No  I want to actually start a college only for the poor. What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.  So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice. They said   Please  don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college.  So it's the only college in India where  if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's  you are disqualified to come. You have to be a cop out or a wash out or a dropout to come to our college. You have to work with your hands. You have to have a dignity of labor. You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community. So we started the Barefoot College  and we redefined professionalism. Who is a professional  A professional is someone who has a combination of competence  confidence and belief. A water diviner is a professional. A traditional midwife is a professional. A traditional bone setter is a professional. These are professionals all over the world. You find them in any inaccessible village around the world. And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal. It needs to be used  needs to be applied  needs to be shown to the world outside    that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today. So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi. You eat on the floor  you sleep on the floor  you work on the floor. There are no contracts  no written contracts. You can stay with me for    years  go tomorrow. And no one can get more than      a month. You come for the money  you don't come to Barefoot College. You come for the work and the challenge  you'll come to the Barefoot College. That is where we want you to try crazy ideas. Whatever idea you have  come and try it. It doesn't matter if you fail. Battered  bruised  you start again. It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher. And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate. You are certified by the community you serve. You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer. So when I said that  they said   Well show us what is possible. What are you doing  This is all mumbo jumbo if you can't show it on the ground.  So we built the first Barefoot College in     . It was built by    Barefoot architects who can't read and write  built on   .   a sq. ft.     people lived there  worked there. They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in     . But then they suspected  they thought there was an architect behind it. I said   Yes  they made the blueprints  but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college.  We are the only ones who actually returned the award for          because they didn't believe us  and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia. I asked a forester    high powered  paper qualified expert    I said   What can you build in this place   He had one look at the soil and said   Forget it. No way. Not even worth it. No water  rocky soil.  I was in a bit of a spot. And I said   Okay  I'll go to the old man in village and say  'What should I grow in this spot '  He looked quietly at me and said   You build this  you build this  you put this  and it'll work.  This is what it looks like today. Went to the roof  and all the women said   Clear out. The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men. This is waterproofing the roof.  It is a bit of jaggery  a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know. But it actually doesn't leak. Since       it hasn't leaked. This technology  the women will not share with the men. It's the only college which is fully solar electrified. All the power comes from the sun.    kilowatts of panels on the roof. And everything works off the sun for the next    years. So long as the sun shines  we'll have no problem with power. But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest  a Hindu priest  who's only done eight years of primary schooling    never been to school  never been to college. He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed. Food  if you come to the Barefoot College  is solar cooked. But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women  illiterate women  who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker. It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker. Unfortunately  they're almost half German  they're so precise. You'll never find Indian women so precise. Absolutely to the last inch  they can make that cooker. And we have    meals twice a day of solar cooking. We have a dentist    she's a grandmother  illiterate  who's a dentist. She actually looks after the teeth of       children. Barefoot technology  this was         no engineer  no architect thought of it    but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs. Very little water is wasted. All the roofs are connected underground to a         liter tank  and no water is wasted. If we have four years of drought  we still have water on the campus  because we collect rainwater.    percent of children don't go to school  because they have to look after animals    sheep  goats    domestic chores. So we thought of starting a school at night for the children. Because the night schools of Tilonia  over        children have gone through these night schools. Because it's for the convenience of the child  it's not for the convenience of the teacher. And what do we teach in these schools  Democracy  citizenship  how you should measure your land  what you should do if you're arrested  what you should do if your animal is sick. This is what we teach in the night schools. But all the schools are solar lit. Every five years we have an election. Between six to    year old children participate in a democratic process  and they elect a prime minister. The prime minister is    years old. She looks after    goats in the morning  but she's prime minister in the evening. She has a cabinet  a minister of education  a minister for energy  a minister for health. And they actually monitor and supervise     schools for       children. She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago  and she went to Sweden. First time ever going out of her village. Never seen Sweden. Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening. And the Queen of Sweden  who's there  turned to me and said   Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from  She's only    years old  and she's not dazzled by anything.  And the girl  who's on her left  turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said   Please tell her I'm the prime minister.  Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high  we use puppetry. Puppets is the way we communicate. You have Jokhim Chacha who is     years old. He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher. He's my doctor. He's my lawyer. He's my donor. He actually raises money  solves my disputes. He solves my problems in the village. If there's tension in the village  if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent  the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says   Shake hands. The attendance must not drop.  These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports. So this decentralized  demystified approach of solar electrifying villages  we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan    all solar electrified villages by people who have been trained. And we went to Ladakh  and we asked this woman    this  at minus     you have to come out of the roof  because there's no place  it was all snowed up on both sides    and we asked this woman   What was the benefit you had from solar electricity   And she thought for a minute and said   It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter.  Went to Afghanistan. One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable. Men are restless  men are ambitious  men are compulsively mobile  and they all want a certificate. All across the globe  you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate. Why  Because they want to leave the village and go to a city  looking for a job. So we came up with a great solution  train grandmothers. What's the best way of communicating in the world today  Television  No. Telegraph  No. Telephone  No. Tell a woman. So we went to Afghanistan for the first time  and we picked three women and said   We want to take them to India.  They said   Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms  and you want to take them to India.  I said   I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well.  So I took the husbands along. Of course  the women were much more intelligent than the men. In six months  how do we train these women  Sign language. You don't choose the written word. You don't choose the spoken word. You use sign language. And in six months they can become solar engineers. They go back and solar electrify their own village. This woman went back and solar electrified the first village  set up a workshop    the first village ever to be solar electrified in Afghanistan  was  by the three women. This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.    years old  and she's solar electrified     houses for me in Afghanistan. And they haven't collapsed. She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC. He didn't know. Those three women have trained    more women and solar electrified     villages in Afghanistan. We went to Africa  and we did the same thing. All these women sitting at one table from eight  nine countries  all chatting to each other  not understanding a word  because they're all speaking a different language. But their body language is great. They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers. I went to Sierra Leone  and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night    comes across this village. Comes back  goes into the village  says   Well what's the story   They said   These two grandmothers ...    Grandmothers   The minister couldn't believe what was happening.  Where did they go    Went to India and back.  Went straight to the president. He said   Do you know there's a solar electrified village in Sierra Leone   He said   No.  Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.  What's the story.  So he summoned me and said   Can you train me     grandmothers   I said   I can't  Mr. President. But they will. The grandmothers will.  So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone. And     grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone. Gambia  we went to select a grandmother in Gambia. Went to this village. I knew which woman I would like to take. The community got together and said   Take these two women.  I said   No  I want to take this woman.  They said   Why  She doesn't know the language. You don't know her.  I said   I like the body language. I like the way she speaks.   Difficult husband  not possible.  Called the husband  the husband came  swaggering  politician  mobile in his hand.  Not possible.   Why not    The woman  look how beautiful she is.  I said   Yeah  she is very beautiful.   What happens if she runs off with an Indian man   That was his biggest fear. I said   She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile.  She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger. She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran. She handled the national press  and she was a star. And when I went back six months later  I said   Where's your husband    Oh  somewhere. It doesn't matter.  Success story. I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside. Look for solutions within. And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you. They're all over the world. Don't even worry. Don't listen to the World Bank  listen to the people on the ground. They have all the solutions in the world. I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.  First they ignore you  then they laugh at you  then they fight you  and then you win.  Thank you. Why can't we solve these problems  We know what they are. Something always seems to stop us. Why  I remember March the   th      . The B   iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. In the newspaper it said  it was all part of a normal process.  A little bit further on in the article it said  a loss that would normally take the ice shelf        years to replace.  That same word   normal   had two different  almost opposite meanings. If we walk into the B   iceberg when we leave here today  we're going to bump into something a thousand feet tall     miles long     miles wide  and it's going to weigh two gigatons. I'm sorry  there's nothing normal about this. And yet I think it's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions. Only    days after this  arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred. It was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome. This is the code that's in every single one of our    trillion cells that makes us who we are and what we are. And if we just take one cell's worth of this code and unwind it  it's a meter long  two nanometers thick. Two nanometers is    atoms in thickness. And I wondered  what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places  where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms  And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy  the electron  So I started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists I could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there  and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas. Six and a half years later  a hundred and eighty researchers  they have some amazing developments in the lab  and I will show you three of those today  such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead  we can generate all the energy we need right where we are  cleanly  safely  and cheaply. Think of the space that we spend most of our time. A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun. We like the light that comes into the room  but in the middle of summer  all that heat is coming into the room that we're trying to keep cool. In winter  exactly the opposite is happening. We're trying to heat up the space that we're in  and all that is trying to get out through the window. Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in  One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material  carbon  that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor  and when the vaporized carbon condenses  it condenses back into a different form  chickenwire rolled up. But this chickenwire carbon  called a carbon nanotube  is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs. It's a thousand times more conductive than copper. How is that possible  One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently. You think of carbon as black. Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible. And when it's in this form  if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it's in its colored state  it will reflect away all heat and light  and when it's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between. To change its state  by the way  takes two volts from a millisecond pulse. And once you've changed its state  it stays there until you change its state again. As we were working on this incredible discovery at University of Florida  we were told to go down the corridor to visit another scientist  and he was working on a pretty incredible thing. Imagine if we didn't have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night. We'd have to see at night  right  This lets you do it. It's a nanomaterial  two nanomaterials  a detector and an imager. The total width of it is     times smaller than the width of a decimal place. And it takes all the infrared available at night  converts it into an electron in the space of two small films  and is enabling you to play an image which you can see through. I'm going to show to TEDsters  the first time  this operating. Firstly I'm going to show you the transparency. Transparency is key. It's a film that you can look through. And then I'm going to turn the lights out. And you can see  off a tiny film  incredible clarity. As we were working on this  it dawned on us  this is taking infrared radiation  wavelengths  and converting it into electrons. What if we combined it with this  Suddenly you've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window. But because it's flexible  it can be on any surface whatsoever. The power plant of tomorrow is no power plant. We talked about generating and using. We want to talk about storing energy  and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago  the lead acid battery. In terms of dollars per what's stored  it's simply the best. Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power  we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas  and we gave them this diagram. It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas Fort Worth Airport. We said   Could you build this   And these scientists  instead of laughing at us  said   Yeah.  And what they built was eBox. EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside  hold it until you need it  and then be able to release it and pass it off. Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly  efficiently and cheaply right where I am. It's my energy. And if I don't need it  I can convert it back up on the window to energy  light  and beam it  line of site  to your place. And for that I do not need an electric grid between us. The grid of tomorrow is no grid  and energy  clean efficient energy  will one day be free. If you do this  you get the last puzzle piece  which is water. Each of us  every day  need just eight glasses of this  because we're human. When we run out of water  as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world  we're going to have to get this from the sea  and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.    trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend. These also require tremendous amounts of energy. In fact  it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water. We're simply not going to do that. But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply  we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need. I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists  no kinder than many of the people in the world  but they have a magic look at the world. And I'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world. It's been a long time in coming for me.    years ago  I saw a photograph in the paper. It was taken by Kevin Carter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there. I've carried this photograph with me every day since then. It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst. By any standard this is wrong. It's just wrong. We can do better than this. We should do better than this. And whenever I go round to somebody who says   You know what  you're working on something that's too difficult. It'll never happen. You don't have enough money. You don't have enough time. There's something much more interesting around the corner   I say   Try saying that to her.  That's what I say in my mind. And I just say  thank you   and I go on to the next one. This is why we have to solve our problems  and I know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature  the stuff of life  the simple electron. Thank you. Good afternoon. If you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks  you may have heard of a kind of crisis between China and the U.S. regarding cyberattacks against the American company Google. Many things have been said about this. Some people have called a cyberwar what may actually be just a spy operation    and obviously  a quite mishandled one. However  this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons. It so happens that these weapons are dangerous. They're of a new nature  they could lead the world into a digital conflict that could turn into an armed struggle. These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world. In       in the middle of the Cold War in Soviet Siberia  a pipeline exploded with a burst of   kilotons  the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb. Now we know today    this was revealed by Thomas Reed  Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary    this explosion was actually the result of a CIA sabotage operation  in which they had managed to infiltrate the IT management systems of that pipeline. More recently  the U.S. government revealed that in September       more than   million people in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil were plunged into darkness  victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates. Even more worrying for the Americans  in December      the holiest of holies  the IT systems of CENTCOM  the central command managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  may have been infiltrated by hackers who used these  plain but infected USB keys. And with these keys  they may have been able to get inside CENTCOM's systems  to see and hear everything  and maybe even infect some of them. As a result  the Americans take the threat very seriously. I'll quote General James Cartwright  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  who says in a report to Congress that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction. Moreover  the Americans have decided to spend over    billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities. And across the world today  we see a sort of cyber arms race  with cyberwar units built up by countries like North Korea or even Iran. Yet  what you'll never hear from spokespeople from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence is that the question isn't really who's the enemy  but actually the very nature of cyber weapons. And to understand why  we must look at how  through the ages  military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace. For example  if we'd had TEDxParis     years ago  we would have talked about the military innovation of the day    the massive Vauban style fortifications    and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in Europe. which was indeed the case in Europe between      and     . Similarly  if we'd had this talk    or    years ago  we would have seen how the rise of nuclear weapons  and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply  prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers. However  if we'd had this talk    years ago  we would have seen how the emergence of new aircraft and tank technologies  which give the advantage to the attacker  make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible and thus create the possibility of war in Europe. So military technologies can influence the course of the world  can make or break world peace    and there lies the issue with cyber weapons. The first issue  Imagine a potential enemy announcing they're building a cyberwar unit  but only for their country's defense. Okay  but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit  It gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous. Just   years ago  both the U.S. and France were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace  strictly to defend their IT systems. But today both countries say the best defense is to attack. And so  they're joining China  whose doctrine of use for    years has been both defensive and offensive. The second issue  Your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness  and you may not even know who's attacking you. Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature  they can be used without leaving traces. This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker  because the defender doesn't know who to fight back against. And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary  they risk making one more enemy and ending up diplomatically isolated. This issue isn't just theoretical. In May       Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks  that damaged its communication and banking systems. Estonia accused Russia. But NATO  though it defends Estonia  reacted very prudently. Why  Because NATO couldn't be      sure that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks. So to sum up  on the one hand  when a possible enemy announces they're building a cyberwar unit  you don't know whether it's for attack or defense. On the other hand  we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking. In a major article published in       Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York described a model to understand how conflicts could arise. In this context  when you don't know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack  and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking  then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict. This is the environment that's being created by cyber weapons today  and historically it was the environment in Europe at the onset of World War I. So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature  but in addition  they're emerging in a much more unstable environment. If you remember the Cold War  it was a very hard game  but a stable one played only by two players  which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers. Today we're moving to a multipolar world in which coordination is much more complicated  as we have seen at Copenhagen. And this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons. Why  Because no nation knows for sure whether its neighbor is about to attack. So nations may live under the threat of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling called the  reciprocal fear of surprise attack   as I don't know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not    I may never know    so I might take the upper hand and attack first. Just last week  in a New York Times article dated January           it was revealed for the first time that officials at the National Security Agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the U.S. was about to be cyberattacked. And these preemptive attacks might not just remain in cyberspace. In May       General Kevin Chilton  commander of the U.S. nuclear forces  stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.  all options would be on the table. Cyber weapons do not replace conventional or nuclear weapons    they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror. But in doing so  they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict    as we've just seen  a very important risk    and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us  European allies  NATO members  our American friends and allies  our other Western allies  and maybe  by forcing their hand a little  our Russian and Chinese partners. The information technologies Jo l de Rosnay was talking about  which were historically born from military research  are today on the verge of developing an offensive capability of destruction  which could tomorrow  if we're not careful  completely destroy world peace. Thank you. So today  I would like to talk with you about bionics  which is the popular term for the science of replacing part of a living organism with a mechatronic device  or a robot. It is essentially the stuff of life meets machine. And specifically  I'd like to talk with you about how bionics is evolving for people with arm amputations. This is our motivation. Arm amputation causes a huge disability. I mean  the functional impairment is clear. Our hands are amazing instruments. And when you lose one  far less both  it's a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do. There's also a huge emotional impact. And actually  I spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability. And finally  there's a profound social impact. We talk with our hands. We greet with our hands. And we interact with the physical world with our hands. And when they're missing  it's a barrier. Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma  with things like industrial accidents  motor vehicle collisions or  very poignantly  war. There are also some children who are born without arms  called congenital limb deficiency. Unfortunately  we don't do great with upper limb prosthetics. There are two general types. They're called body powered prostheses  which were invented just after the Civil War  refined in World War I and World War II. Here you see a patent for an arm in     . It's not a lot different than the one you see on my patient. They work by harnessing shoulder power. So when you squish your shoulders  they pull on a bicycle cable. And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook or bend an elbow. And we still use them commonly  because they're very robust and relatively simple devices. The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses. These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle. Every time you contract a muscle  it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis. They work pretty well for people who have just lost their hand  because your hand muscles are still there. You squeeze your hand  these muscles contract. You open it  these muscles contract. So it's intuitive  and it works pretty well. Well how about with higher levels of amputation  Now you've lost your arm above the elbow. You're missing not only these muscles  but your hand and your elbow too. What do you do  Well our patients have to use very code y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs. We have robotic limbs. There are several available on the market  and here you see a few. They contain just a hand that will open and close  a wrist rotator and an elbow. There's no other functions. If they did  how would we tell them what to do  We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints to get up to six motors  or six degrees of freedom. And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the U.S. military  using these prototypes  that had up to    different degrees of freedom including movable hands. But at the end of the day  how do we tell these robotic arms what to do  How do we control them  Well we need a neural interface  a way to connect to our nervous system or our thought processes so that it's intuitive  it's natural  like for you and I. Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain  going down your spinal cord  out the nerves and to your periphery. And your sensation's the exact opposite. You touch yourself  there's a stimulus that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain. When you lose your arm  that nervous system still works. Those nerves can put out command signals. And if I tap the nerve ending on a World War II vet  he'll still feel his missing hand. So you might say  let's go to the brain and put something in the brain to record signals  or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there. And these are very exciting research areas  but it's really  really hard. You have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons    ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are microvolts. And it's just too hard to use now and for my patients today. So we developed a different approach. We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals    muscles. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand fold  so that we can record them from on top of the skin  like you saw earlier. So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. Imagine  with somebody who's lost their whole arm  we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it. Now you think   Close hand   and a little section of your chest contracts. You think   Bend elbow   a different section contracts. And we can use electrodes or antennae to pick that up and tell the arm to move. That's the idea. So this is the first man that we tried it on. His name is Jesse Sullivan. He's just a saint of a man       year old lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder. Jesse came to us at the RIC to be fit with these state of the art devices  and here you see them. I'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side. And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches. On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints  and he operates little pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go. And Jesse's a good crane operator  and he did okay by our standards. He also required a revision surgery on his chest. And that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation. So my colleague  Dr. Greg Dumanian  did the surgery. First  we cut away the nerve to his own muscle  then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest and closed him up. And after about three months  the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch. And after six months  the nerves grew in well  and you could see strong contractions. And this is what it looks like. This is what happens when Jesse thinks open and close his hand  or bend or straighten your elbow. You can see the movements on his chest  and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae  or electrodes. And I challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this. His brain is thinking about his arm. He has not learned how to do this with the chest. There is not a learning process. That's why it's intuitive. So here's Jesse in our first little test with him. On the left hand side  you see his original prosthesis  and he's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other. He's had that arm for about    months  so he's pretty good with it. On the right side  two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis    which  by the way  is the same physical arm  just programmed a little different    you can see that he's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks. And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time. Then we had one of those little surprises in science. So we're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms. And after a few months  you touch Jesse on his chest  and he felt his missing hand. His hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat  so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated  if you would  his skin. So you touch Jesse here  he feels his thumb  you touch it here  he feels his pinky. He feels light touch down to one gram of force. He feels hot  cold  sharp  dull  all in his missing hand  or both his hand and his chest  but he can attend to either. So this is really exciting for us  because now we have a portal  a portal  or a way to potentially give back sensation  so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand. Imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin. So it was very exciting. We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above the elbow amputations. And here we deinnervate  or cut the nerve away  just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal. This was one of our first patients  Chris. You see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use  and on the right  it is two months. He's about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric. All right. So one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators. And we're fortunate today to have Amanda Kitts come and join us. Please welcome Amanda Kitts. So Amanda  would you please tell us how you lost your arm  Amanda Kitts  Sure. In       I had a car accident. And I was driving home from work  and a truck was coming the opposite direction  came over into my lane  ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. Todd Kuiken  Okay  so after your amputation  you healed up. And you've got one of these conventional arms. Can you tell us how it worked  AK  Well  it was a little difficult  because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep. So for the simple little things like picking something up  I would have to bend my elbow  and then I would have to cocontract to get it to change modes. When I did that  I had to use my bicep to get the hand to close  use my tricep to get it to open  cocontract again to get the elbow to work again. TK  So it was a little slow  AK  A little slow  and it was just hard to work. You had to concentrate a whole lot. TK  Okay  so I think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery  took six more months to have all the reinnervation. Then we fit her with a prosthesis. And how did that work for you  AK  It works good. I was able to use my elbow and my hand simultaneously. I could work them just by my thoughts. So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that. TK  A little faster  AK  A little faster. And much more easy  much more natural. TK  Okay  this was my goal. For    years  my goal was to let somebody  be  able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time. And we now have over    patients around the world who have had this surgery  including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the U.S. armed services. The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high. It's like    percent. Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle. And it provides intuitive control. Our functional testing  those little tests  all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier. And the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it. So that was all very exciting. But we want to do better. There's a lot of information in those nerve signals  and we wanted to get more. You can move each finger. You can move your thumb  your wrist. Can we get more out of it  So we did some experiments where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks    from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something    and recorded this data. And then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms  called pattern recognition. See. And here you can see  on Jesse's chest  when he just tried to do three different things  you can see three different patterns. But I can't put in an electrode and say   Go there.  So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick  came up with this algorithm control  which Amanda can now demonstrate. AK  So I have the elbow that goes up and down. I have the wrist rotation that goes    and it can go all the way around. And I have the wrist flexion and extension. And I also have the hand closed and open. TK  Thank you  Amanda. Now this is a research arm  but it's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that I've borrowed from around the world. It's about seven pounds  which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here. Obviously  that's heavy for Amanda. And in fact  it feels even heavier  because it's not glued on the same. She's carrying all the weight through harnesses. So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics  but the control. So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals. So Amanda  when you first started using this arm  how long did it take to use it  AK  It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train. I had to hook it up to a computer  so I couldn't just train it anywhere. So if it stopped working  I just had to take it off. So now it's able to train with just this little piece on the back. I can wear it around. If it stops working for some reason  I can retrain it. Takes about a minute. TK  So we're really excited  because now we're getting to a clinically practical device. And that's where our goal is    to have something clinically pragmatic to wear. We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier. Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation. And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago. So Amanda  you can see  has really good control. It's all the pattern recognition. And it now has a hand that can do different grasps. What we do is have the patient go all the way open and think   What hand grasp pattern do I want   It goes into that mode  and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand. Amanda  how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm  AK  I was able to get four. I had the key grip  I had a chuck grip  I had a power grasp and I had a fine pinch. But my favorite one was just when the hand was open  because I work with kids  and so all the time you're clapping and singing  so I was able to do that again  which was really good. TK  That hand's not so good for clapping. AK  Can't clap with this one. TK  All right. So that's exciting on where we may go with the better mechatronics  if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial. I want you to watch closely. TK  That's Claudia  and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic. She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces  and she could feel different textures of sandpaper  different grits  ribbon cable  as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table  it felt like her finger was rocking. So that's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back  potentially  some skin sensation. But here's another video that shows some of our challenges. This is Jesse  and he's squeezing a foam toy. And the harder he squeezes    you see a little black thing in the middle that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes. But look at all the electrodes around it. I've got a real estate problem. You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there  but our little motor's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes. So we're really challenged on what we're doing there. The future is bright. We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do. So for example  one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals. We want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the EMG signals  so that it's not worrying about electrode contact. And we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback. We want to build a better arm. This arm    they're always made for the   th percentile male    which means they're too big for five eighths of the world. So rather than a super strong or super fast arm  we're making an arm that is    we're starting with  the   th percentile female    that will have a hand that wraps around  opens all the way  two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow. So it'll be the smallest and lightest and the smartest arm ever made. Once we can do it that small  it's a lot easier making them bigger. So those are just some of our goals. And we really appreciate you all being here today. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side  with yesterday's theme. So Amanda came jet lagged  she's using the arm  and everything goes wrong. There was a computer spook  a broken wire  a converter that sparked. We took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm. And none of those problems could I have dealt with  but I have a really bright research team. And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it. That's science. And fortunately  it worked today. So thank you very much. Is there anything unique about human beings  There is. We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments. We're obsessed with morality as social creatures. We need to know why people are doing what they're doing. And I personally am obsessed with morality. It was all due to this woman  Sister Mary Marastela  also known as my mom. As an altar boy  I breathed in a lot of incense  and I learned to say phrases in Latin  but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top down morality applied to everybody. I saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality. I thought  maybe there's some earthly basis for moral decisions. But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral. I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality. I want to know if there was a moral molecule. After    years of experiments  I found it. Would you like to see it  I brought some with me. This little syringe contains the moral molecule. It's called oxytocin. So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals. In rodents  it was known to make mothers care for their offspring  and in some creatures  allowed for toleration of burrowmates. But in humans  it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women  and is released by both sexes during sex. So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule. I did what most of us do    I tried it on some colleagues. One of them told me   Paul  that is the world's stupidist idea. It is   he said   only a female molecule. It can't be that important.  But I countered   Well men's brains make this too. There must be a reason why.  But he was right  it was a stupid idea. But it was testably stupid. In other words  I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral. Turns out it wasn't so easy. First of all  oxytocin is a shy molecule. Baseline levels are near zero  without some stimulus to cause its release. And when it's produced  it has a three minute half life  and degrades rapidly at room temperature. So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin  have to grab it fast and keep it cold. I think I can do that. Now luckily  oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood  so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery. Then I had to measure morality. So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project. So I started smaller. I studied one single virtue  trustworthiness. Why  I had shown in the early     s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous. So in these countries  more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created  alleviating poverty. So poor countries are by and large low trust countries. So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness  I might help alleviate poverty. But I'm also a skeptic. I don't want to just ask people   Are you trustworthy   So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research. If you're so virtuous  show me the money. So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money. Let me show you how we do that. So we recruit some people for an experiment. They all get     if they agree to show up. We give them lots of instruction  and we never ever deceive them. Then we match them in pairs by computer. And in that pair  one person gets a message saying   Do you want to give up some of your     you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab   The trick is you can't see them  you can't talk to them. You only do it one time. Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person's account. You're going to make them a lot wealthier. And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money. Do you want to keep it all  or do you want to send some amount back  So think about this experiment for minute. You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half. Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood. And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger  So this was the birth of vampire economics. Make a decision and give me some blood. So in fact  experimental economists had run this test around the world  and for much higher stakes  and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust  and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness. But in fact  economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money. They assumed money is good  why not keep it all  That's not what we found. We found    percent of the first decision makers sent money  and of those who received money     percent returned some of it. But why  Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received  the more their brain produced oxytocin  and the more oxytocin on board  the more money they returned. So we have a biology of trustworthiness. But wait. What's wrong with this experiment  Two things. One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation. So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin  but they didn't have any effect. But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness. I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness. So to make the experiment  I knew I'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly. I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain. And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler. So along with colleagues in Zurich  we put     men on oxytocin or placebo  had that same trust test with money  and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust  we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger    all without altering mood or cognition. So oxytocin is the trust molecule  but is it the moral molecule  Using the oxytocin inhaler  we ran more studies. We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by    percent. We showed it increases donations to charity by    percent. We've also investigated non pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin. These include massage  dancing and praying. Yes  my mom was happy about that last one. And whenever we raise oxytocin  people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers. But why do they do this  What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin  To investigate this question  we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year old son  and his son has terminal brain cancer. After they watched the video  we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin. The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy. So it's empathy that makes us connect to other people. It's empathy that makes us help other people. It's empathy that makes us moral. Now this idea is not new. A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in      called  The Theory of Moral Sentiments.  In this book  Smith argued that we are moral creatures  not because of a top down reason  but for a bottom up reason. He said we're social creatures  so we share the emotions of others. So if I do something that hurts you  I feel that pain. So I tend to avoid that. If I do something that makes you happy  I get to share your joy. So I tend to do those things. Now this is the same Adam Smith who     years later  would write a little book called  The Wealth of Nations     the founding document of economics. But he was  in fact  a moral philosopher  and he was right on why we're moral. I just found the molecule behind it. But knowing that molecule is valuable  because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off. In particular  it tells us why we see immorality. So to investigate immorality  let me bring you back now to     . I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara  California. You sit in a gas station all day  you see lots of morality and immorality  let me tell you. So one Sunday afternoon  a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box. Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside. And he said   Hey  I was in the men's room. I just found this. What do you think we should do with it    I don't know  put it in the lost and found.   Well this is very valuable. We have to find the owner for this.  I said   Yea.  So we're trying to decide what to do with this  and the phone rings. And a man says very excitedly   I was in your gas station a while ago  and I bought this jewelry for my wife  and I can't find it.  I said   Pearl necklace    Yeah.   Hey  a guy just found it.   Oh  you're saving my life. Here's my phone number. Tell that guy to wait half an hour. I'll be there and I'll give him a      reward.  Great  so I tell the guy   Look  relax. Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good.  He said   I can't do it. I have this job interview in Galena in    minutes  and I need this job  I've got to go.  Again he asked me   What do you think we should do   I'm in high school. I have no idea. So I said   I'll hold it for you.  He said   You know  you've been so nice  let's split the reward.  I'll give you the jewelry  you give me a hundred dollars  and when the guy comes ...   You see it. I was conned. So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop  and I was the pigeon. So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him  it's that he shows he trusts the victim. Now we know what happens. The victim's brain releases oxytocin  and you're opening up your wallet or purse  giving away the money. So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems  We found  testing thousands of individuals  that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus. So if you trust them  their brains don't release oxytocin. If there's money on the table  they keep it all. So there's a technical word for these people in my lab. We call them bastards. These are not people you want to have a beer with. They have many of the attributes of psychopaths. Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited. One is through improper nurturing. So we've studied sexually abused women  and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus. You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly. Also  high stress inhibits oxytocin. So we all know this  when we're really stressed out  we're not acting our best. There's another way oxytocin is inhibited  which is interesting    through the action of testosterone. So we  in experiments  have administered testosterone to men. And instead of sharing money  they become selfish. But interestingly  high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish. Now think about this. It means  within our own biology  we have the yin and yang of morality. We have oxytocin that connects us to others  makes us feel what they feel. And we have testosterone. And men have    times the testosterone as women  so men do this more than women    we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally. We don't need God or government telling us what to do. It's all inside of us. So you may be wondering  these are beautiful laboratory experiments  do they really apply to real life  Yeah  I've been worrying about that too. So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives. So last summer  I attended a wedding in Southern England.     people in this beautiful Victorian mansion. I didn't know a single person. And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall. And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes. And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows. And guess what  Weddings cause a release of oxytocin  but they do so in a very particular way. Who is the center of the wedding solar system  The bride. She had the biggest increase in oxytocin. Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride  Her mother  that's right. Her mother was number two. Then the groom's father  then the groom  then the family  then the friends    arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun. So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple  connect us emotionally. Why  Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species. I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers. So even though I have a fear of heights  I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at        ft. I took my blood before and after  and I had a huge spike of oxytocin. And there are so many ways we can connect to people. For example  through social media. Many people are Tweeting right now. So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double digit increase in oxytocin. So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System. And they had the reporters and their producers participate. And one of these guys  he must have been     he had     percent spike in oxytocin. I mean  astounding  no one has this. So he was using social media in private. When I wrote my report to the Koreans  I said   Look  I don't know what this guy was doing   but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend. They checked. He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page. There you go. That's connection. So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people  and it seems to be universal. Two weeks ago  I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands    very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia. There are     different languages in the highlands. These are the most primitive people in the world. And they indeed also release oxytocin. So oxytocin connects us to other people. Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel. And it's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin. I know how to do it  and my favorite way to do it is  in fact  the easiest. Let me show it to you. Come here. Give me a hug. There you go. So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname Dr. Love. I'm happy to share a little more love in the world  it's great  but here's your prescription from Dr. Love  eight hugs a day. We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier. And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types. Dr. Love says eight hugs a day. Eight hugs a day    you'll be happier and the world will be a better place. Of course  if you don't like to touch people  I can always shove this up your nose. Thank you. What is it about flying cars  We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years. And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success. But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really  truly seamlessly integrates the two dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three dimensional sky above us    that  I don't know about you  but I really enjoy spending time in. We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that  despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren't available previously    we have modern composite materials  we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power to rate ratios than have ever been available  we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit    but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective  we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years  which isn't where we want to be right now. So instead of trying to make a car that can fly  we decided to try to make a plane that could drive. And the result is the Terrafugia Transition. It's a two seat  single engine airplane that works just like any other small airplane. You take off and land at a local airport. Then once you're on the ground  you fold up the wings  drive it home  park it in your garage. And it works. After two years of an innovative design and construction process  the proof of concept made its public debut in     . Now like with anything that's really different from the status quo  it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft. And we discovered that it's a very good thing that  when you go home with something that's been broken  you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through. Still  we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air  off the ground  like it was supposed to be. And on our third high speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York  we got to do that for the first time. The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time. And we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over. The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it  but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market  the general aviation community  and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft  particularly in the States. The FAA  about a year ago  gave us an exemption for the Transition to allow us to have an additional     lbs. within the light sport aircraft category. Now that doesn't sound like a lot  but it's very important  because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it  but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it. A sport pilot can be certificated in as little as    hours of flight time. And at     lbs.  that's very important for solving the other side of the equation    driving. It turns out that driving  with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles  is actually a harder problem to solve than flying. For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground  this may be counter intuitive  but driving has potholes  cobblestones  pedestrians  other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with. Fortunately  necessity remains the mother of invention  and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground    everything from a continuously variable transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop and go traffic  to a custom designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground  to the automated wing folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment  to crash safety features. We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than    percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car. Now this also  as good as it is  wasn't quite enough. The regulations for vehicles on the road weren't written with an airplane in mind. So we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Now you may have seen in the news recently  they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the Transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks. As a multi purpose passenger vehicle  it is now officially  designed for occasional off road use.  Now let's see it in action. You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane. You're not powering the propeller  you're powering the wheels. And it is under seven feet tall  so it will fit in a standard construction garage. And that's the automated wing folding mechanism. That's real time. You just push a few buttons in the cockpit  and the wings come out. Once they're fully deployed  there's a mechanical lock that goes into place  again  from inside the cockpit. And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight    just like putting down your convertible top. And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.    percent of your risk is that first flight. Radio  It actually flew. Yes. Radio    That was gorgeous. Radio  What did you think of that  That was beautiful from up here  I tell you. AMD  See  we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop. And our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight  which was that it was  remarkably unremarkable.  He would go onto tell us that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire    year career as a test pilot. So despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary  we really focused on doing as little new as possible. We leverage a lot of technology from the state of the art in general aviation and from automotive racing. When we do have to do something truly out of the box  we use an incremental design  build  test  redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps. Now since we started Terrafugia about   years ago  we've had a lot of those baby steps. We've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston. We've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about  figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you   But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended    to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground. Still  if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the two production prototypes that we're working on right now  those first deliveries to the  about a hundred  people who have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year. The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes. And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy  but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane. Here's why. While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports  there is a huge underutilized resource out there. There are thousands of local airstrips that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could. On average  there's one within    to    miles of wherever you are in the United States. The Transition gives you a safer  more convenient and more fun way of using this resource. For those of you who aren't yet pilots  there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to  the weather  primarily  cost  long door to door travel time and mobility at your destination. Now  bad weather comes in  just land  fold up the wings  drive home. Doesn't matter if it rains a little  you have a windshield wiper. Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger  park it in your garage. And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas. Door to door travel time is reduced  because now  instead of lugging bags  finding a parking space  taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger  you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go. And mobility to your destination is clearly solved. Just fold up the wings and keep going. The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller  more accessible place. It also continues to be a fabulous adventure. I hope you'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world  and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you. I'm a neuroscientist. And in neuroscience  we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain. But I want to start with the easiest question and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life  because it's a fundamental question if we want to understand brain function. And that is  why do we and other animals have brains  Not all species on our planet have brains  so if we want to know what the brain is for  let's think about why we evolved one. Now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think  and that's completely wrong. If you think about this question for any length of time  it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain. We have a brain for one reason and one reason only  and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements. There is no other reason to have a brain. Think about it. Movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you. Now that's not quite true. There's one other way  and that's through sweating. But apart from that  everything else goes through contractions of muscles. So think about communication    speech  gestures  writing  sign language    they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles. So it's really important to remember that sensory  memory and cognitive processes are all important  but they're only important to either drive or suppress future movements. There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life. Now for those who don't believe this argument  we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain  but the clinching evidence is this animal here    the humble sea squirt. Rudimentary animal  has a nervous system  swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life. And at some point of its life  it implants on a rock. And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock  which it never leaves  is to digest its own brain and nervous system for food. So once you don't need to move  you don't need the luxury of that brain. And this animal is often taken as an analogy to what happens at universities when professors get tenure  but that's a different subject. So I am a movement chauvinist. I believe movement is the most important function of the brain    don't let anyone tell you that it's not true. Now if movement is so important  how well are we doing understanding how the brain controls movement  And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly  it's a very hard problem. But we can look at how well we're doing by thinking about how well we're doing building machines which can do what humans can do. Think about the game of chess. How well are we doing determining what piece to move where  If you pit Garry Kasparov here  when he's not in jail  against IBM's Deep Blue  well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win. And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room  it would win every time. That problem is solved. What about the problem of picking up a chess piece  dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board  If you put a five year old child's dexterity against the best robots of today  the answer is simple  the child wins easily. There's no competition at all. Now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard  One reason is a very smart five year old could tell you the algorithm for that top problem    look at all possible moves to the end of the game and choose the one that makes you win. So it's a very simple algorithm. Now of course there are other moves  but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution. When it comes to being dexterous  it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous. And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world  which has a lot of problems. But let me show you cutting edge robotics. Now a lot of robotics is very impressive  but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages. So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes. And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass. It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about  but it can do it. But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human. Now if you want this robot to do a different task  that's another three year Ph.D. program. There is no generalization at all from one task to another in robotics. Now we can compare this to cutting edge human performance. So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking. Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking. It's a high school sport where you have    cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order. And this is her getting the world record in real time. And she's pretty happy. We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that  and that's what we'd like to know. So in my group  what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement. And it sounds like an easy problem. You send a command down  it causes muscles to contract. Your arm or body moves  and you get sensory feedback from vision  from skin  from muscles and so on. The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be. So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is  for example  sensory feedback is extremely noisy. Now by noise  I do not mean sound. We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal. So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard  crrcckkk  on the station you wanted to hear  that was the noise. But more generally  this noise is something that corrupts the signal. So for example  if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand  you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback. Similarly  when you put motor output on movement output  it's extremely noisy. Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts  just aim for the same spot over and over again. You have a huge spread due to movement variability. And more than that  the outside world  or task  is both ambiguous and variable. The teapot could be full  it could be empty. It changes over time. So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise. Now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise. So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick  our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars. Now what I want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and variability. And to do that  I'm going to tell you about a framework which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last    years called Bayesian decision theory. And it's more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty. And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions. So let's think about the inference. You want to generate beliefs about the world. So what are beliefs  Beliefs could be  where are my arms in space  Am I looking at a cat or a fox  But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities. So we're going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one    zero meaning I don't believe it at all  one means I'm absolutely certain. And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty. And the key idea to Bayesian inference is you have two sources of information from which to make your inference. You have data  and data in neuroscience is sensory input. So I have sensory input  which I can take in to make beliefs. But there's another source of information  and that's effectively prior knowledge. You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories. And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs. And I've put the formula up there. I'm not going to explain what that formula is  but it's very beautiful. And it has real beauty and real explanatory power. And what it really says  and what you want to estimate  is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input. So let me give you an intuitive example. Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you. There are two sources of information Bayes' rule tells you. There's sensory evidence    you can use visual information auditory information  and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot. But you know that your senses are not perfect  and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red  representing numbers between  .  and maybe  . . That information is available in the current shot  but there's another source of information not available on the current shot  but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis  and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match. If you're playing against a very good opponent  they may distribute it in that green area  which is the prior distribution  making it hard for you to return. Now both these sources of information carry important information. And what Bayes' rule says is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow  which have the ellipses  and that's my belief. So it's the optimal way of combining information. Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago  we showed this is exactly what people do when they learn new movement skills. And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines. As we go around  we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down  but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is  and then combine those in a real Bayesian way. Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula. And what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs. So that really means I have to make predictions of the future. And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get. And moreover  it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do. And to do that  I'll tell you about how the brain deals with sensory input. So you send a command out  you get sensory feedback back  and that transformation is governed by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus. But you can imagine looking inside the brain. And here's inside the brain. You might have a little predictor  a neural simulator  of the physics of your body and your senses. So as you send a movement command down  you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions. So as I shake this ketchup bottle  I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row. And if I've got a good predictor  it predicts the same thing. Well why would I bother doing that  I'm going to get the same feedback anyway. Well there's good reasons. Imagine  as I shake the ketchup bottle  someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me. Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act. So I get two sources. I get you tapping on it  and I get me shaking it  but from my senses' point of view  that is combined together into one source of information. Now there's good reason to believe that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events. Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant than feeling everything that's going on inside my body. So one way to reconstruct that is to compare the prediction    which is only based on your movement commands    with the reality. Any discrepancy should hopefully be external. So as I go around the world  I'm making predictions of what I should get  subtracting them off. Everything left over is external to me. What evidence is there for this  Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person. And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling. It's been known for a long time  you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can. But it hasn't really been shown  it's because you have a neural simulator  simulating your own body and subtracting off that sense. So we can bring the experiments of the   st century by applying robotic technologies to this problem. And in effect  what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot  and they're going to move that back and forward. And then we're going to track that with a computer and use it to control another robot  which is going to tickle their palm with another stick. And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things including ticklishness. I'll show you just one part of our study. And here I've taken away the robots  but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward. And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay. Either no time delay  in which case light would just tickle your palm  or with a time delay of two tenths of three tenths of a second. So the important point here is the right hand always does the same things    sinusoidal movement. The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle. All we're playing with is a tempo causality. And as we go from naught to  .  second  it becomes more ticklish. As you go from  .  to  .   it becomes more ticklish at the end. And by  .  of a second  it's equivalently ticklish to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything. So whatever is responsible for this cancellation is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality. And based on this illustration  we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations. Now I have to admit  these are the worst studies my lab has ever run. Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes  you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant. So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena. And in the intervening years I had two daughters. And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys  they get into fights    which started with one of them doing something to the other  the other retaliating. It quickly escalates. And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force. Now when I screamed at my children to stop  sometimes they would both say to me the other person hit them harder. Now I happen to know my children don't lie  so I thought  as a neuroscientist  it was important how I could explain how they were telling inconsistent truths. And we hypothesize based on the tickling study that when one child hits another  they generate the movement command. They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off. So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have    rather like the tickling. Whereas the passive recipient doesn't make the prediction  feels the full blow. So if they retaliate with the same force  the first person will think it's been escalated. So we decided to test this in the lab. Now we don't work with children  we don't work with hitting  but the concept is identical. We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game. And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other. And the game is very simple. We started with a motor with a little lever  a little force transfuser. And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers for three seconds and then it stops. And that player's been told  remember the experience of that force and use your other finger to apply the same force down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser    and they do that. And player two's been told  remember the experience of that force. Use your other hand to apply the force back down. And so they take it in turns to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward. But critically  they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms. So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by. And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms. And if we look at what we start with  a quarter of a Newton there  a number of turns  perfect would be that red line. And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this    a    percent escalation in force on each go. So it really suggests  when you're doing this    based on this study and others we've done    that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing. So it re shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts. So we've made inferences  we've done predictions  now we have to generate actions. And what Bayes' rule says is  given my beliefs  the action should in some sense be optimal. But we've got a problem. Tasks are symbolic    I want to drink  I want to dance    but the movement system has to contract     muscles in a particular sequence. And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system. So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways. So think about just a point to point movement. I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths. Having chosen a particular path  I can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations. And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed. So I have a huge amount of choice to make. Now it turns out  we are extremely stereotypical. We all move the same way pretty much. And so it turns out we're so stereotypical  our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry to decode this stereotyping. So if I take some dots and set them in motion with biological motion  your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on. Now this is a bunch of dots moving. You will know what this person is doing  whether happy  sad  old  young    a huge amount of information. If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit  you would have absolutely no idea what's going on. So why is it that we move the particular ways we do  Well let's think about what really happens. Maybe we don't all quite move the same way. Maybe there's variation in the population. And maybe those who move better than others have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation. So in evolutionary scales  movements get better. And perhaps in life  movements get better through learning. So what is it about a movement which is good or bad  Imagine I want to intercept this ball. Here are two possible paths to that ball. Well if I choose the left hand path  I can work out the forces required in one of my muscles as a function of time. But there's noise added to this. So what I actually get  based on this lovely  smooth  desired force  is a very noisy version. So if I pick the same command through many times  I will get a different noisy version each time  because noise changes each time. So what I can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if I choose that way. If I choose a different way of moving    on the right for example    then I'll have a different command  different noise  playing through a noisy system  very complicated. All we can be sure of is the variability will be different. If I move in this particular way  I end up with a smaller variability across many movements. So if I have to choose between those two  I would choose the right one because it's less variable. And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise. And one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger. So you want to avoid big forces as one principle. So we've shown that using this  we can explain a huge amount of data    that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to minimize negative consequences of noise. So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there and evolved to control movement. And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that. But it's also relevant for disease and rehabilitation. There are many diseases which effect movement. And hopefully if we understand how we control movement  we can apply that to robotic technology. And finally  I want to remind you  when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks  the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain is really quite dramatic. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Quick question for you  Dan. So you're a movement     DW  Chauvinist.     chauvinist. Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about    the dreaming  the yearning  the falling in love and all these things    are a kind of side show  an accident  DW  No  no  actually I think they're all important to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end. So I think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood. The fact that we forget most of our childhood  for example  is probably fine  because it doesn't effect our movements later in life. You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement. CA  So you think that people thinking about the brain  and consciousness generally  could get real insight by saying  where does movement play in this game  DW  So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake. You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision. And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way. CA  Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed. So historically there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side  and living systems on the other side. So we go from  say  this beautiful and complex crystal as non life  and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side. Over the last hundred and fifty years or so  science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems  and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two. We'll just take one example here  a virus is a natural system  right  But it's very simple. It's very simplistic. It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements  it doesn't have all the characteristics of living systems and is in fact a parasite on other living systems in order to  say  reproduce and evolve. But what we're going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum    so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory  mixing together nonliving ingredients to make new structures  and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems. Really what I'm talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life. So what are these characteristics that I'm talking about  These are them. We consider first that life has a body. Now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment. Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself. Life also has a kind of inheritable information. Now we  as humans  we store our information as DNA in our genomes and we pass this information on to our offspring. If we couple the first two    the body and the metabolism    we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate  and if we coupled these now to inheritable information  we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike  and would perhaps evolve. And so these are the things we will try to do in the lab  make some experiments that have one or more of these characteristics of life. So how do we do this  Well  we use a model system that we term a protocell. You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell  and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together  play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive. In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same  but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules    so a drastic reduction in complexity  but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike. And so what we do is  we start simple and we work our way up to living systems. Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc  a hundred years ago  considering a kind of synthetic biology   The synthesis of life  should it ever occur  will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea.  That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories  it's probably not going to impact our lives at all.  If we accept the theory of evolution  then the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist in the production of forms intermediate between the inorganic and the organic world  or between the non living and living world  forms which possess only some of the rudimentary attributes of life     so  the ones I just discussed     to which other attributes will be slowly added in the course of development by the evolutionary actions of the environment.  So we start simple  we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life  and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike. This is how we can start to make a protocell. We use this idea called self assembly. What that means is  I can mix some chemicals together in a test tube in my lab  and these chemicals will start to self associate to form larger and larger structures. So say on the order of tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of molecules will come together to form a large structure that didn't exist before. And in this particular example  what I took is some membrane molecules  mixed those together in the right environment  and within seconds it forms these rather complex and beautiful structures here. These membranes are also quite similar  morphologically and functionally  to the membranes in your body  and we can use these  as they say  to form the body of our protocell. Likewise  we can work with oil and water systems. As you know  when you put oil and water together  they don't mix  but through self assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form  and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism or for our protocell  as you will see later. So that's just forming some body stuff  right  Some architectures. What about the other aspects of living systems  So we came up with this protocell model here that I'm showing. We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite. This is natural from the environment  this clay. It forms a surface that is  say  chemically active. It could run a metabolism on it. Certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay. For example  in this case  RNA  shown in red    this is a relative of DNA  it's an informational molecule    it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay. This structure  then  can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself  so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself  and that's shown in green here on this micrograph. So just through self assembly  mixing things together in the lab  we can come up with  say  a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body  right  So we're on a road towards living systems. But if you saw this protocell  you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive. It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms  it doesn't really do anything. So  something is missing. Some things are missing. So some things that are missing is  for example  if you had a flow of energy through a system  what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself  much like living systems do. So we came up with a different protocell model  and this is actually simpler than the previous one. In this protocell model  it's just an oil droplet  but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something  to actually become dynamic  as we'll see here. You add the droplet to the system. It's a pool of water  and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system. Okay  Oil droplet forms through self assembly  has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy  and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment. As we heard earlier  movement is very important in these kinds of living systems. It is moving around  exploring its environment  and remodeling its environment  as you see  by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell. So it's acting  in a sense  like a living system trying to preserve itself. We take this same moving protocell here  and we put it in another experiment  get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system  and you'll see that in blue here  right  So I add some food source to the system. The protocell moves. It encounters the food. It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there. Alright  So not only do we have this system that has a body  it has a metabolism  it can use energy  it moves around. It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself. Now  this doesn't have a brain  it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior. If we count the number of chemicals in that system  actually  including the water that's in the dish  we have five chemicals that can do this. So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do  and depending on the conditions  we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment. On the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other  and they form a kind of a dance  a complex dance with each other. Right  So not only do individual protocells have behavior  what we've interpreted as behavior in this system  but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have. So now that you're all experts on protocells  we're going to play a game with these protocells. We're going to make two different kinds. Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry inside that  when activated  the protocell starts to vibrate around  just dancing. So remember  these are primitive things  so dancing protocells  that's very interesting to us.  Laughter  The second protocell has a different chemistry inside  and when activated  the protocells all come together and they fuse into one big one. Right  And we just put these two together in the same system. So there's population A  there's population B  and then we activate the system  and protocell Bs  they're the blue ones  they all come together. They fuse together to form one big blob  and the other protocell just dances around. And this just happens until all of the energy in the system is basically used up  and then  game over. So then I repeated this experiment a bunch of times  and one time something very interesting happened. So  I added these protocells together to the system  and protocell A and protocell B fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB. That didn't happen before. There it goes. There's a protocell AB now in this system. Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit  while protocell B does the fusing  okay  But then something even more interesting happens. Watch when these two large protocells  the hybrid ones  fuse together. Now we have a dancing protocell and a self replication event. Right.  Laughter  Just with blobs of chemicals  again. So the way this works is  you have a simple system of five chemicals here  a simple system here. When they hybridize  you then form something that's different than before  it's more complex than before  and you get the emergence of another kind of lifelike behavior which in this case is replication. So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like  interesting colors and interesting behaviors  and they're very easy to make  and they have interesting lifelike properties  perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step  one of the first steps by which life got started on the early Earth. Certainly  there were molecules present on the early Earth  but they wouldn't have been these pure compounds that we worked with in the lab and I showed in these experiments. Rather  they'd be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff  because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds. Think of it like a primordial ooze  okay  And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully characterize  even by modern methods  and the product looks brown  like this tar here on the left. A pure compound is shown on the right  for contrast. So this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen  you put them in a pan  and you apply energy. You turn up the heat  you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar  forming a brownish caramel  right  If you let that go unregulated  you'll continue to make and break chemical bonds  forming an even more diverse mixture of molecules that then forms this kind of black tarry stuff in your pan  right  that's difficult to wash out. So that's what the origin of life would have looked like. You needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early Earth  four   .  billion years ago. So the challenge then is  throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab  and try to make some protocells with lifelike properties from this kind of primordial ooze. So we're able to then see the self assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we've seen previously  and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar    this diverse  very complex  organic black tar. And we put them into one of these experiments  as you've seen earlier  and then we watch lively movement that comes out. They look really good  very nice movement  and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other  similar to what we've seen before    but again  working with just primordial conditions  no pure chemicals. These are also  these tar fueled protocells  are also able to locate resources in their environment. I'm going to add some resource from the left  here  that defuses into the system  and you can see  they really like that. They become very energetic  and able to find the resource in the environment  similar to what we saw before. But again  these are done in these primordial conditions  really messy conditions  not sort of sterile laboratory conditions. These are very dirty little protocells  as a matter of fact.  Laughter  But they have lifelike properties  is the point. So  doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non living and living systems. And not only that  but it helps us broaden our view of what life is and what possible life there could be out there    life that could be very different from life that we find here on Earth. And that leads me to the next term  which is  weird life.  This is a term by Steve Benner. This is used in reference to a report in      by the National Research Council in the United States  wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe  okay  especially if that life is very different from life on Earth. If we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there  how could we even recognize it as life  Well  they came up with three very general criteria. First is    and they're listed here. The first is  the system has to be in non equilibrium. That means the system cannot be dead  in a matter of fact. Basically what that means is  you have an input of energy into the system that life can use and exploit to maintain itself. This is similar to having the Sun shining on the Earth  driving photosynthesis  driving the ecosystem. Without the Sun  there's likely to be no life on this planet. Secondly  life needs to be in liquid form  so that means even if we had some interesting structures  interesting molecules together but they were frozen solid  then this is not a good place for life. And thirdly  we need to be able to make and break chemical bonds. And again this is important because life transforms resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain itself. Now today  I told you about very strange and weird protocells    some that contain clay  some that have primordial ooze in them  some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them. Most of these don't contain DNA  but yet they have lifelike properties. But these protocells satisfy these general requirements of living systems. So by making these chemical  artificial life experiments  we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet  but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe. Thank you. Hi. Today  I'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects  done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors. We call ourselves Pors and Rao  and we live and work in India. I'd like to begin with my very first object  which I call  The Uncle Phone.  And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him  almost like I were an extension of his body    to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water  a pack of cigarettes. And as I grew up  it became worse and worse  And I started to think of it as a form of control. But of course  I could never say anything  because the uncle is a respected figure in the Indian family. And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone. He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him. And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle  I made him  The Uncle Phone.  It's so long that it requires two people to use it. It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person. But the problem is that  when I left home and went to college  I started missing his commands. And so I made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email. So what he had to do was take a piece of paper  roll it into the carriage  type his email or command and pull the paper out. This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email. So here you can see  we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital. So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface. And of course  the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism  the way my uncle likes it. The next work is a sound sensitive installation that we affectionately call  The Pygmies.  And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy  sensitive and sweet creatures. So how it works is we have these panels  which we have on the wall  and behind them  we have these little creatures which hide. And as soon as it's silent  they sort of creep out. And if it's even more silent  they stretch their necks out. And at the slightest sound  they hide back again. So we had these panels on three walls of a room. And we had over     of these little pygmies hiding behind them. So this is how it works. This is a video prototype. So when it's quiet  it's sort of coming out from behind the panels. And they hear like humans do  or real creatures do. So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile. And they don't react to background sounds. You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to. But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second. So we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible. So each pygmy has its own behavior  psyche  mood swings  personalities and so on. So this is a very early prototype. Of course  it got much better after that. And we made them react to people  but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them. This is a video installation called  The Missing Person.  And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility. How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility  So we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance  and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us  using a camera that could look at people in the room  track them and replace one person with the background  rendering them invisible. So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype. On the right side you can see my colleague Soren  who's actually in the space. And on the left side  you'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible. Soren enters the room. Pop  He goes invisible. And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing. It's a very early video  so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that  but that got refined pretty soon  later. So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space  and we had one monitor  one on each wall. And as people walked into the room  they would see themselves in the monitor  except with one difference  one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room. So this is a work called  The Sun Shadow.  And it was almost like a sheet of paper  like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun. And from the front  this object appeared to be very strong and robust  and from the side  it almost seemed very weak. So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it  thinking it was some crap laying around. But as soon as they passed by  it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion. And it would get exhausted  and it would collapse every time. So this work is a caricature of an upside down man. His head is so heavy  full of heavy thoughts  that it's sort of fallen into his hat  and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant. Well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement. And it's kind of constrained by that circle. Because if that circle weren't there  and the floor was very even  it would start to wander about in the space. And there's no wires. So I'll just show you an instance    so when people enter the room  it activates this object. And it very slowly  over a few minutes  sort of painfully goes up  and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall. And this is an important moment  because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help  or save the subject. But it doesn't really need it  because it  again  sort of manages to pull itself up. So this work was a real technical challenge for us  and we worked very hard  like most of our works  over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics. And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall  because if we made it in a way that it would topple over  then it would damage itself  and if it didn't fall enough  it wouldn't instill that fatalism  or that sense of wanting to go and help it. So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario    it's much faster. That's my colleague. He's let it go. Now he's getting nervous  so he's going to go catch it. But he doesn't need to  because it manages to lift itself up on its own. So this is a work that we were very intrigued with  working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics  which twinkle like the night sky. And it's at the scale of the night sky. So we wrapped this around a blob like form  which is in the shape of a teddy bear  which was hanging from the ceiling. And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear  which is very comforting and intimate. And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space  and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky. So this is the last work  and a work in progress  and it's called  Space Filler.  Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room  and as you approached it  it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and  eight  times its volume. And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it    almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something. So we work with a lot of technology  but we don't really love technology  because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years. But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create. And once a creature pops into our minds  it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move. Thank you. I'd like to start with a short story. It's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp. They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis  and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls  but at the same time they excited him. And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work. Let's fast forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later  where I started a technology company that brought the world its first  D laser scanning system. Let me show you how it works. Female Voice  Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light. The system measures the beam's time of flight  recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return. With two mirrors  the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles  giving accurate x  y  and z coordinates. The point is then recorded into a  D visualization program. All of this happens in seconds. Ben Kacyra  You can see here  these systems are extremely fast. They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution. A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard pressed to produce maybe     points in a whole day. These babies would be producing something like ten thousand points a second. So  as you can imagine  this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry. Approximately ten years ago  my wife and I started a foundation to do good  and right about that time  the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas  hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan  were blown up by the Taliban. They were gone in an instant. And unfortunately  there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas. This clearly devastated me  and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends  the winged bulls  and the fate of the many  many heritage sites all over the world. Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites. We called the project CyArk  which stands for Cyber Archive. To date  with the help of a global network of partners  we've completed close to fifty projects. Let me show you some of them  Chichen Itza  Rapa Nui    and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points    Babylon  Rosslyn Chapel  Pompeii  and our latest project  Mt. Rushmore  which happened to be one of our most challenging projects. As you see here  we had to develop a special rig to bring the scanner up close and personal. The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers. We also produce media for dissemination to the public    free through the CyArk website. These would be used for education  cultural tourism  etc. What you're looking at in here is a  D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of  the  cloud of points in real time  cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions. This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal. In here you see a traditional  D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation  and of course we tell the stories through fly throughs. And here  this is a fly through the cloud of points of Tikal  and here you see it rendered and photo textured with the photography that we take of the site. And so this is not a video. This is actual  D points with two to three millimeter accuracy. And of course the data can be used to develop  D models that are very accurate and very detailed. And here you're looking at a model that's extracted from the cloud of points for Stirling Castle. It's used for studies  for visualization  as well as for education. And finally  we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools. The more I got involved in the heritage field  the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them. Of course  earthquakes and all the natural phenomena    floods  tornadoes  etc.    take their toll. However  what occurred to me was human caused destruction  which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction  but actually it was accelerating. This includes arson  urban sprawl  acid rain  not to mention terrorism and wars. It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle. We're losing our sites and the stories  and basically we're losing a piece    and a significant piece    of our collective memory. Imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from. Luckily  in the last two or three decades  digital technologies have been developing that have helped us to develop tools that we've brought to bear in the digital preservation  in our digital preservation war. This includes  for example  the  D laser scanning systems  ever more powerful personal computers   D graphics  high definition digital photography  not to mention the Internet. Because of this accelerated pace of destruction  it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work. And we created a project we call the CyArk     Challenge    and that is to digitally preserve     World Heritage Sites in five years. We do have the technology that's scaleable  and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate  so we're comfortable that this task can be accomplished. However  to me  the     is really just the first    . In order to sustain our work into the future  we use technology centers where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them  whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites  and at the same time  it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future. Let me close with another short story. Two years ago  we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site  a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda  the Royal Kasubi Tombs. The work was done successfully in the field  and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the CyArk website. Last March  we received very sad news. The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson. A few days later  we received a call   Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction   Our answer  of course  was yes. Let me leave you with a final thought. Our heritage is much more than our collective memory    it's our collective treasure. We owe it to our children  our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well  I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so  while I've been speaking  you have been scanned. The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on the screen. This is all in  D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points. You can look at it from on top  from the ceiling. You can look from different vantage points  but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd  just to show the amount of detail that we can create. So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes. I'd like to thank the wizards here. We were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this  the Historic Scotland  and the Glasgow School of Art. I'd like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell  who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland. David. And Doug Pritchard  who's the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art. Let's give them a hand. Thank you. Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain. We chart it  we've described it  we've drawn it  we've mapped it. Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology    think Google Maps  think GPS    the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation. So let's take a look at the brain. Most people  when they first look at a fresh human brain  they say   It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain.  Typically  what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray. And this outer layer  this is the vasculature  which is incredible  around a human brain. This is the blood vessels.    percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs     percent of the blood pumped from your heart  is servicing this one organ. That's basically  if you hold two fists together  it's just slightly larger than the two fists. Scientists  sort of at the end of the   th century  learned that they could track blood flow to map non invasively where activity was going on in the human brain. So for example  they can see in the back part of the brain  which is just turning around there. There's the cerebellum  that's keeping you upright right now. It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement. On the side here  this is temporal cortex. This is the area where primary auditory processing    so you're hearing my words  you're sending it up into higher language processing centers. Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought  decision making    it's the last to mature in late adulthood. This is where all your decision making processes are going on. It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner. So if you take a deeper look at the brain  one of the things  if you look at it in cross section  what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there. But there's actually a lot of structure there. It's cells and it's wires all wired together. So about a hundred years ago  some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells. And that's shown here in the the very light blue. You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. And what you can see is it's very non uniform. You see a lot more structure there. So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex. It's one continuous processing unit  if you will. But you can also see things underneath there as well. And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through. They're probably less cell dense. So there's about    billion neurons in our brain. And as you can see  they're very non uniformly distributed. And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function. And of course  as I mentioned before  since we can now start to map brain function  we can start to tie these into the individual cells. So let's take a deeper look. Let's look at neurons. So as I mentioned  there are    billion neurons. There are also these smaller cells as you'll see. These are support cells    astrocytes glia. And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input. They're storing it  they're processing it. Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to        other neurons in your brain. And each neuron itself is largely unique. The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry. These are proteins. They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement. They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with. And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do. So if we zoom in to an even deeper level  all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes. We each have    pairs of chromosomes. We get one from mom  one from dad. And on these chromosomes are roughly        genes. They're encoded in the DNA. And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these        genes are turned on and at what level they're turned on. And so our project is seeking to look at this readout  understanding which of these        genes is turned on. So in order to undertake such a project  we obviously need brains. So we sent our lab technician out. We were seeking normal human brains. What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office. This a place where the dead are brought in. We are seeking normal human brains. There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains. We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of    to     they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain  no history of psychiatric disease  no drugs on board    we do a toxicology workup. And we're very careful about the brains that we do take. We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue  we can get consent to take the tissue within    hours of time of death. Because what we're trying to measure  the RNA    which is the readout from our genes    is very labile  and so we have to move very quickly. One side note on the collection of brains  because of the way that we collect  and because we require consent  we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains. Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life. And men are much more likely to have their significant other  spouse  give consent than the other way around. So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR. This is magnetic resonance imaging    MRI. It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data. So we collect this MR. And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map. The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging. This maps the large cabling in the brain. And again  you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways  if you will. The brain is removed from the skull  and then it's sliced into one centimeter slices. And those are frozen solid  and they're shipped to Seattle. And in Seattle  we take these    this is a whole human hemisphere    and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer. There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide. We're going to then apply one of those stains to it  and we scan it. And then what we get is our first mapping. So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments. You could consider this state boundaries  if you will  those pretty broad outlines. From this  we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces  which then we can put on a smaller cryostat. And this is just showing this here    this frozen tissue  and it's being cut. This is    microns thin  so this is about a baby hair's width. And remember  it's frozen. And so you can see here  old fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied. We take a microscope slide. Then we very carefully melt onto the slide. This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it. And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this. So again this is what they can see under the microscope. You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places. And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments. And they can make basically what's a reference atlas. This is a more detailed map. Our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection. So the technician takes the instructions. They scribe along a place there. And then the laser actually cuts. You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off. You can see on the microscope slide here  that's what's happening in real time. There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue. We take that tissue  we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology  and then we put a florescent tag on it. We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray. Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you  but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass. This has roughly        elements on it  so we repeatedly measure various genes of the        genes in the genome. And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it  we get a unique fingerprint  if you will  quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample. Now we do this over and over again  this process for any given brain. We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain. This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus. It's involved in learning and memory. And it contributes to about    samples of those thousand samples. So each sample gets us about        data points with repeat measurements  a thousand samples. So roughly  we have    million data points for a given human brain. We've done right now two human brains worth of data. We've put all of that together into one thing  and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like. It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world. They don't even have to log in to come use this tool  mine this data  find interesting things out with this. So here's the modalities that we put together. You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before. Here's the MR. It provides the framework. There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn  it allows you to zoom in  it allows you to highlight individual structures. But most importantly  we're now mapping into this anatomic framework  which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on. So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree. Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on. And each gene gives us a fingerprint. And remember that we've assayed all the        genes in the genome and have all of that data available. So what can scientists learn about this data  We're just starting to look at this data ourselves. There's some basic things that you would want to understand. Two great examples are drugs  Prozac and Wellbutrin. These are commonly prescribed antidepressants. Now remember  we're assaying genes. Genes send the instructions to make proteins. Proteins are targets for drugs. So drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off  etc. So if you want to understand the action of drugs  you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to  and also in the ways you don't want them to. In the side effect profile  etc.  you want to see where those genes are turned on. And for the first time  we can actually do that. We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too. So now we can look throughout the brain. We can see this unique fingerprint. And we get confirmation. We get confirmation that  indeed  the gene is turned on    for something like Prozac  in serotonergic structures  things that are already known be affected    but we also get to see the whole thing. We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before  and we see these genes turned on there. It's as interesting a side effect as it could be. One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can  because it's a pattern matching exercise  because there's unique fingerprint  we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint. So if you're in drug discovery  for example  you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize. Most of you are probably familiar with genome wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying   Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X.  And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great. They analyze large populations. They look at their entire genomes  and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes. But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes. It tells you the what  but it doesn't tell you the where. And so it's very important for those researchers that we've created this resource. Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity. They can start to look at common pathways    other things that they simply haven't been able to do before. So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality. And I think every human  we all have different genetic backgrounds  we all have lived separate lives. But the fact is our genomes are greater than    percent similar. We're similar at the genetic level. And what we're finding is actually  even at the brain biochemical level  we are quite similar. And so this shows it's not    percent  but it's roughly    percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff  so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated. And then we find some outliers  some things that lie beyond the cloud. And those genes are interesting  but they're very subtle. So I think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences  we are quite similar even at the brain level. Now what do those differences look like  This is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were    and they're quite subtle. These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type. These are two genes that we found as good examples. One is called RELN    it's involved in early developmental cues. DISC  is a gene that's deleted in schizophrenia. These aren't schizophrenic individuals  but they do show some population variation. And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four  which are the exceptions to the other two  that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells. It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that's telling us a gene is turned on there. Whether or not that's due to an individual's genetic background or their experiences  we don't know. Those kinds of studies require much larger populations. So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go. I think these resources are incredibly valuable. They give researchers a handle on where to go. But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point. We're certainly going to be looking at more. I'll just close by saying that the tools are there  and this is truly an unexplored  undiscovered continent. This is the new frontier  if you will. And so for those who are undaunted  but humbled by the complexity of the brain  the future awaits. Thanks. I started Improv Everywhere about    years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy. Because I was new to the city  I didn't have access to a stage  so I decided to create my own in public places. So the first project we're going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride. Now this took place in January of     . And this woman is the star of the video. She doesn't know she's being filmed. She's being filmed with a hidden camera. This is on the   train in New York City. And this is the first stop along the line. These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera. And that's me right there in a brown coat. It's about    degrees outside. I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf. And the girl's going to notice me right here. And as you'll see now  I'm not wearing pants. So at this point    at this point she's noticed me  but in New York there's weirdos on any given train car. One person's not that unusual. She goes back to reading her book  which is unfortunately titled  Rape.  So she's noticed the unusual thing  but she's gone back to her normal life. Now in the meantime  I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well. They're going to be entering this car one by one. We'll act as though we don't know each other. And we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made  forgetting our pants on this cold January day. So at this point  she decides to put the rape book away. And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings. Now in the meantime  the two Danish guys to the left of the camera  they're cracking up. They think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before. And watch her make eye contact with them right about now. And I love that moment in this video  because before it became a shared experience  it was something that was maybe a little bit scary  or something that was at least confusing to her. And then once it became a shared experience  it was funny and something that she could laugh at. So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the   line. So the video won't show everything. This goes on for another four stops. A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear. At the eighth stop  a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar    like you might sell batteries or candy on the train. We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants  put them on and said   Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today   and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions. Thank you. So that's a still from the video there. And I love that girl's reaction so much. And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do. And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people. It's a prank  but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell. And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride. And we've continued to do it every year. This January  we did the   th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of       people rode the train in their underwear in New York    almost every single train line in the city. And also in    other cities around the world  people participated. As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians  I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects. So I could do more large scale projects. Well one day I was walking through Union Square  and I saw this building  which had just been built in     . And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing. And it was very peculiar  because it was dark out  but she was back lit with florescent lighting  and she was very much onstage  and I couldn't figure out why she was doing it. After about    seconds  her friend appeared    she had been hiding behind a display    and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away. So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this. So I got inspired by that. Looking at the entire facade    there were    total windows    and I knew what I had to do. So this project is called Look Up More. We had    actors dress in black. This was completely unauthorized. We didn't let the stores know we were coming. And I stood in the park giving signals. The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out  Look Up More   the name of the project. The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together. You'll see that start right here. And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance. And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them. So then I gave a new hand signal  which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever     and he danced. There were several other activities. We had people jumping up and down  people dropping to the ground. And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt  putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement. And because it was in Union Square Park  right by a subway station  there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing. There's a better photo of it. So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon. The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger. A high school kid in Texas wrote me in      and said   You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around.  So I wrote this high school kid back immediately  and I said   Yes  you are correct. I think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you.  So here's the video. So again  this is     . This is the Best Buy in New York City. We had about    people show up to participate  entering one by one. There was an eight year old girl  a    year old girl. There was also a    year old man who participated. So a very diverse group of people. And I told people   Don't work. Don't actually do work. But also  don't shop. Just stand around and don't face products.  Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt. Everybody else is one of our actors. The lower level employees thought it was very funny. And in fact  several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us. A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers. The managers and the security guards  on the other hand  did not find it particularly funny. You can see them in this footage. They're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt. And we were there probably    minutes before the managers decided to dial    . So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming  watch out  the cops were coming. And you can see the cops in this footage right here. That's a cop wearing black right there  being filmed with a hidden camera. Ultimately  the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not  in fact  illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants. Thank you. So we had been there for    minutes  we were happy to exit the store. One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras. And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags. But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop. So I like that concept of using their own technology against them. I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason. And one morning  I was riding the subway. I had to make a transfer at the   rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators. And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning  it's very crowded. So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning. So this was in the winter of              in the morning. It's morning rush hour. It's very cold outside. People are coming in from Queens  transferring from the E train to the   train. And they're going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs. Thank you. So there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better. He gave       high fives that day  and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick. And that was done also without permission  although no one seemed to care. So I'd say over the years  one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is   These people have too much time on their hands.  And you know  not everybody's going to like everything you do  and I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments  but that one's always bothered me  because we don't have too much time on our hands. The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers  they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way. You know  every Saturday and Sunday  hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games. And I've never seen anybody comment  looking at a football game  saying   All those people in the stands  they have too much time on their hands.  And of course they don't. It's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon  watching a football game in a stadium. But I think it's also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with     people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library. Or listening to the same MP  as       other people and dancing silently in a park  or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical  or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire. You know  as kids  we're taught to play. And we're never given a reason why we should play. It's just acceptable that play is a good thing. And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere. It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point. We don't need a reason. As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time  then that's enough for us. And I think  as adults  we need to learn that there's no right or wrong way to play. Thank you very much. I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine. And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for NASA to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into deep space flight  so they could be kept in robotic pods. One of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing  using new scanning technologies  things that had never been seen before. Not only in disease management  but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel. I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen. And your entire body  everything    your hair  skin  bone  nails    everything is made of collagen. And it's a kind of rope like structure that twirls and swirls like this. And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye. In your eye  it becomes a grid formation  and therefore  it becomes transparent  as opposed to opaque. So perfectly organized a structure  it was hard not to attribute divinity to it. Because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body. One of the opportunities I had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH. And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these new technologies. So I wrote the algorithms and code  and he built the hardware    Paul Lauterbur    then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI. I got the data. And I'm going to show you a sample of the piece   From Conception to Birth.   From Conception to Birth   Oocyte   Sperm   Egg Inseminated      Hours  Baby's first division   The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion...   And divides anew every    to    hours.   Early Embryo   Yolk sack still feeding baby.      Days  Heart chamber developing.      Days  Arms   hands are developing      Days  Beginning of the primitive vertebrae   These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus.   If the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire   months  it would be  .  tons at birth.      Days   Embryo's heart is beating twice as fast as the mother's.      Days   Developing retina  nose and fingers   The fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth.      Weeks  Indifferent penis   Girl or boy yet to be determined     Months   Delivery  The expulsion stage   The moment of birth  Alexander Tsiaras  Thank you. But as you can see  when you actually start working on this data  it's pretty spectacular. And as we kept on scanning more and more  working on this project  looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you. And as we kept on working on this data  looking at small clusters of the body  these little pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst  all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus  saying   I'm here to stay.  Having conversation and communications with the estrogens  the progesterones  saying   I'm here to stay  plant me   building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes  within    days  something that you can recognize  and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being. The marvel of this information  How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information  I'm going to show you something pretty unique. Here's a human heart at    days. It's just basically two strands. And like this magnificent origami  cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks  as it's just folding on itself. Within five weeks  you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles. Six weeks  these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart    and then basically the development of the entire human body. The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go    the complexity of these  the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension. Even though I am a mathematician  I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us  It's a mystery  it's magic  it's divinity. Then you start to take a look at adult life. Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries. It's just a tiny sub substructure  microscopic. But basically by the time you're nine months and you're given birth  you have almost        miles of vessels inside your body. And only one mile is visible.        miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away. The complexity of building that within a single system is  again  beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today. And then instructions set  from the brain to every other part of the body    look at the complexity of the folding. Where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information  so as you actually watch the baby's brain grow. And this is one of the things we're doing. We're launching two new studies of scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born. Every six months until they're six years old  we're going to be doing about     children  watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us. And it's not just our own existence  but how does the woman's body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own  but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological  cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture  treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond  again  our comprehension    the magic that is existence  that is us  Thank you.  music by Moby   Grand Canyon  Narrator  Many of the tests are conducted while Yves is strapped onto the wing  because Yves' body is an integral part of the aircraft.  Wind tunnel tests  Narrator  The wing has no steering controls  no flaps  no rudder. Yves uses his body to steer the wing. Stefan Von Bergen  Well  he turns by just putting his head on one or the other side. And sometimes he assists that with his hands  sometimes even with the leg. He's acting as a human fuselage  so to say. And that's quite unique. Narrator  When he arches his back  he gains altitude. When he pushes his shoulders forward  he goes into a dive.  Swiss Alps   Strait of Gibraltar crossing   English Channel crossing  Commentator One  There he goes. There is Yves Rossy. And I think the wing is open. So our first critical moment  it's open. He is down. Is he flying  Commentator Two  It looks like he's stabilized. He's starting to make his climb. Commentator One  There's that    degree turn. He's out over the channel. There is Yves Rossy. There is no turning back now. He is over the English Channel and under way. Ladies and gentlemen  a historic flight has begun.  Images  National Geographic  Commentator Two  And as he approaches the ground  he's going to pull down on those toggles to flare  slow himself down just a little bit  and then come in for a nice landing. Commentator One  There he is. Yves Rossy has landed in England. Bruno Giussani  And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy  And his equipment as well. Yves  welcome. It is quite amazing. Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities. And there were many  many others. So it's possible to fly almost like a bird. What is it like to be up there  Yves Rossy  It's fun. It's fun. I don't have feathers. But I feel like a bird sometimes. It's really an unreal feeling  because normally you have a big thing  a plane  around you. And when I strap just this little harness  this little wing  I really have the feeling of being a bird. BG  How did you start to become Jetman  YR  It was about    years ago  when I discovered free falling. When you go out of an airplane  you are almost naked. You take a position like that. And especially when you take a tracking position  you have the feeling that you are flying. And that's the nearest thing to the dream. You have no machine around you. You are just in the element. It's very short and only in one direction. So the idea was  okay  keep that feeling of freedom  but change the vector and increase the time. BG  So I'm kind of curious  what's your top speed  YR  It's about     km per hour before looping. That means about     miles per hour. BG  What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying  YR  When I exit full of kerosene  I'm about    kilos. I have    kilos on my back. BG  And you're not piloting  There is no handle  no steering  nothing  It is purely your body  and the wings become part of the body and vice versa  YR  That's really the goal  because if you put in steering  then you reinvent the airplane. And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement. And it's really like the kid playing the airplane. I want to go down like that. And up I climb  I turn. It's really pure flying. It's not steering  it's flight. BG  What kind of training do you do  you personally  for that  YR  Actually  I try to stay just fit. I don't do special physical training. I just try to keep my mobility through new activities. For example  last winter I began with kite surfing. So  new things. So you have to adapt. I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot  but this is  really    You need fluidity  you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast. BG  Somebody in the audience asked me   How does he breathe up there   Because you're going fast and you're up at       meters or so. YR  Okay  up to       meters  it's not such a big problem with oxygen. But for example  bikers  they have the same speed. Just with the helmet  integral helmet  it's really no problem to breathe. BG  Describe for me the equipment  since you have it here. So Breitling's four engines. YR  Yeah  two meter span. Ultra stable profile. Four little engines     kilos thrust each  turbines  working with kerosene. Harness  parachute. My only instruments are an altimeter and time. I know I have about eight minutes fuel. So I just check before it's finished. And yeah  that's all. Two parachutes. That means  if I have a problem with the first one I pull  I still have the possibility to open the second one. And this is my life. That's the real important thing about safety. I did use that during these last    years about    times. Never with that type of wing  but at the beginning. I can release my wing when I am in a spin or unstable. BG  We saw the      crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean. So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go  right  YR  Yeah. I did try in the clouds  but you lose orientation completely. So I did try to take  again  a climb altitude. I thought  okay  I will go out. But most probably  I did something like that. BG  Something that is not very safe  the image. YR  You feel great  but    But you have not the right altitude. So the next thing I saw was just blue. It was the sea. I have also an audible altimeter. So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector    fast    so I pulled that. And then I did open my chute. BG  So the wings have their own parachute  and you have your two parachutes. YR  Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons  so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that  just on his head. BG  I see. Maybe come back here. This is risky stuff indeed. People have died trying to do this kind of thing. And you don't look like a crazy guy  you're a Swiss airline pilot  so you're rather a checklist kind of guy. I assume you have standards. YR  Yeah. I have no checklist for that. BG  Let's not tell your employer. YR  No  that's really two worlds. Civil aviation is something that we know very well. We have a hundred years of experience. And you can adapt really precisely. With that  I have to adapt to something new. That means improvise. So it's really a play between these two approaches. Something that I know very well  these principles. For example  we have two engines on an Airbus  with only one engine  you can fly it. So plan B  always a plan B. In a fighter  you have an ejection seat. That's my ejection seat. So I have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of Mother Nature. BG  It's well said. What happens if one of the engines stops  YR  I do a roll. And then I stabilize  and according to my altitude  I continue on two or three engines. It's sometimes possible. It's quite complicated to explain  but according to which regime I was  I can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land  and then I open my parachute. BG  So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter  and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines  and then you basically take off mid air somewhere. And then the landing  as we have seen  arriving on this side of the Channel  is through a parachute. So just as a curiosity  where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon  Did you land on the rim  down at the bottom  YR  It was down on the bottom. And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back. But it was too stony and full of cactus on top. BG  That's exactly why I asked the question. YR  And also  the currents are quite funny there. There is big thermal activity  big difference in altitude also. So it was much safer for me to land at the bottom. BG  I think that right now  many people are asking   When are you developing a double seater so they can fly with you   YR  I have a standard answer. Have you ever seen tandem birds  BG  Perfect answer. BG  Yves  one last question. What's next for you  What's next for Jetman  YR  First  to instruct a younger guy. I want to share it  to do formation flights. And I plan to start from a cliff  like catapulted from a cliff. BG  So instead of jumping off a plane  yes  YR  Yes  with the final goal to take off  but with initial speed. Really  I go step by step. It seems a little bit crazy  but it's not. It's possible to start already now  it's just too dangerous. Thanks to the increasing technology  better technology  it will be safe. And I hope it will be for everybody. BG  Yves  thank you very much. Yves Rossy. I've always had a fascination for computers and technology  and I made a few apps for the iPhone  iPod Touch  and iPad. I'd like to share a couple with you today. My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was. My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber  which is      Laughter      which is a Justin Bieber Whac A Mole. I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit  so I decided to make the app. So I went to work programming it  and I released it just before the holidays in     . A lot of people ask me  how did I make these  A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also. A lot of kids these days like to play games  but now they want to make them  and it's difficult  because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. I mean  for soccer  you could go to a soccer team. For violin  you could get lessons for a violin. But what if you want to make an app  And their parents  the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young  but not many parents have written apps.  Laughter  Where do you go to find out how to make an app  Well  this is how I approached it. This is what I did. First of all  I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down  such as Python  C  Java  etc. And then Apple released the iPhone  and with it  the iPhone software development kit  and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me  and after playing with the software development kit a little bit  I made a couple apps  I made some test apps. One of them happened to be Earth Fortune  and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store  and so I persuaded my parents to pay the    dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store. They agreed  and now I have apps on the App Store. I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family  friends  teachers and even people at the Apple Store  and that's been a huge help to me. I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs  and I've started an app club at school  and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This is so I can share my experiences with others. There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program  and some districts have them. I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. A big challenge is  how should the iPads be used  and what apps should we put on the iPads  So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like. When we design the app and we sell it  it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to  all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. These days  students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology.  Laughter  So     Laughter     sorry     Laughter     so this is a resource to teachers  and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. First of all  I'd like to create more apps  more games. I'm working with a third party company to make an app. I'd like to get into Android programming and development  and I'd like to continue my app club  and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. Thank you.  Applause  Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging  This is a dream of the ages. But scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible. They thought you just wear out  there's nothing you can do about it    kind of like an old shoe. But if you look in nature  you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans. Now these animals are different from one another  because they have different genes. So that suggests that somewhere in these genes  somewhere in the DNA  are genes for aging  genes that allow them to have different lifespans. So if there are genes like that  then you can imagine that  if you could change one of the genes in an experiment  an aging gene  maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan. And if you could do that  then you could find the genes for aging. And if they exist and you can find them  then maybe one could eventually do something about it. So we've set out to look for genes that control aging. And we didn't study any of these animals. Instead  we studied a little  tiny  round worm called C. elegans  which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence. And we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long lived mutant. So we started to change genes at random  looking for long lived animals. And we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf   doubled the lifespan of the little worm. So you can see in black  after a month    they're very short lived  that's why we like to study them for studies of aging    in black  after a month  the normal worms are all dead. But at that time  most of the mutant worms are still alive. And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead. And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here. So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age    a young adult. It's quite a cute little fellow. And next you're going to see the long lived mutant when it's young. So this animal is going to live twice as long. Is it miserable  It doesn't seem to be. It's active. You can't tell the difference really. And they can be completely fertile    have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do. Now get out your handkerchiefs here. You're going to see  in just two weeks  the normal worms are old. You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there. But everything else is just lying there. The animal's clearly in the nursing home. And if you look at the tissues of the animal  they're starting to deteriorate. You know  even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans    which probably most of you haven't seen one    you can tell they're old    isn't that interesting  So there's something about aging that's kind of universal. And now here is the daf   mutant. One gene is changed out of         and look at it. It's the same age  but it's not in the nursing home  it's going skiing. This is what's really cool  it's aging more slowly. It takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day. And when I tell people about this  they tend to think of maybe an    or    year old person who looks really good for being    or   . But it's really more like this  let's say you're a    year old guy    or in your   s    and you're a bachelor and you're dating people. And you meet someone you really like  you get to know her. And you're in a restaurant  and you say   Well how old are you   She says   I'm   .  That's what it's like. And you would never know. You would never know  until she told you. Okay. So what is the daf   gene  Well as you know  genes  which are part of the DNA  they're instructions to make a protein that does something. And the daf   gene encodes a hormone receptor. So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell. So part of it is like a baseball glove. Part of it's on the outside  and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green. And the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell. Okay  so what is the daf   receptor telling the inside of the cell  I just told you that  if you make a mutation in the daf   gene cell  that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well  the animal lives longer. So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging. That's what that arrow means. It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster. So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself  speeding up aging. So this is altogether really  really interesting. It says that aging is subject to control by the genes  and specifically by hormones. So what kind of hormones are these  There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone  adrenalin. You know about a lot of them. These hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies. The daf   hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF  . Now you've all heard of at least insulin. Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal. And the hormone IGF   promotes growth. So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time  but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about    maybe they also affect aging. And it's looking like that's the case. So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans  people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking  if we made the same daf   mutation  the hormone receptor mutation  in other animals  will they live longer  And that is the case in flies. If you change this hormone pathway in flies  they live longer. And also in mice    and mice are mammals like us. So it's an ancient pathway  because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals. And also  the common precursor also gave rise to people. So maybe it's working in people the same way. And there are hints of this. So for example  there was one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City. And just like any population  most of the people live to be about    or     but some live to be    or    . And what they found was that people who lived to    or     were more likely to have daf   mutations    that is  changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for IGF  . And these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted. It damaged the gene. So those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging. So the next question  of course  is  Is there any effect on age related disease  As you age  you're much more likely to get cancer  Alzheimer's disease  heart disease  all sorts of diseases. It turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases. They hardly get cancer  and when they do it's not as severe. So it's really interesting  and it makes sense in a way  that they're still young  so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old  So it suggests that  if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans  maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once. So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging  How could that work  Well it turns out that in the daf   mutants  a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues  and repair damage. And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO. So in a daf   mutant    you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor. The receptor isn't working as well. Under those conditions  the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus    that little compartment there in the middle of the cell    and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it. You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO. And it's just sitting on one of them. So FOXO turns on a lot of genes. And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes  genes I call carrot giver genes  whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well    to fold correctly and function correctly. And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged. DNA repair genes are more active in these animals. And the immune system is more active. And many of these different genes  we've shown  actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf   mutant. So it's really interesting. These animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do. They have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage  which we think makes them live longer. So what about the normal worm  Well when the daf   receptor is active  then it triggers a series of events that prevent FOXO from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is. So it can't turn the genes on. That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan  until we have the daf   mutant. But what good is this for the worm  Well we think that insulin and IGF   hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions    in the good times    when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment. Then they promote the uptake of nutrients. You can store the food  use it for energy  grow  etc. But what we think is that  under conditions of stress  the levels of these hormones drop    for example  having limited food supply. And that  we think  is registered by the animal as a danger signal  a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity. So it activates FOXO  FOXO goes to the DNA  and that triggers the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself. And that's why we think the animals live longer. So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent. So maybe he's a little bit lazy  but he's there  he's taking care of the building. But it's deteriorating. And then suddenly  he learns that there's going to be a hurricane. So he doesn't actually do anything himself. He gets on the telephone    just like FOXO gets on the DNA    and he calls up the roofer  the window person  the painter  the floor person. And they all come and they fortify the house. And then the hurricane comes through  and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in. And not only that  it can also just last longer  even if there isn't a hurricane. So that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists. Now the really cool thing about FOXO is that there are different forms of it. We all have FOXO genes  but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene. Just like we all have eyes  but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes. And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be    or    . And that's the case all over the world  as you can see from these stars. And each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked   Okay  are there differences in the type of FOXO genes among people who live a really long time   and there are. We don't know the details of how this works  but we do know then that FOXO genes can impact the lifespan of people. And that means that  maybe if we tweak it a little bit  we can increase the health and longevity of people. So this is really exciting to me. A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little  round worms to affect lifespan  and here it affects lifespan in people. So we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this FOXO cell using human cells now in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age related diseases. And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work. There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging. And for at least one of them  there is a drug. There's one called TOR  which is another nutrient sensor  like the insulin pathway. And mutations that damage the TOR gene    just like the daf   mutations    extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice. But in this case  there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity. And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse    even when it's pretty old  like age    for a human  that old for a mouse    if you give the mouse rapamycin  it will live longer. Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin. It is a drug for people  but the reason is it suppresses the immune system. So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected. So this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer. But still  here in the year       there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan  which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals. So I'm really optimistic  and I think it won't be too long  I hope  before this age old dream begins to come true. Thank you. Matt Ridley  Thank you  Cynthia. Let me get this straight. Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me  what you could do now pretty well in the lab  if you were allowed ethically  is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer  CK  Ah  so the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes  they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity. So if you stop taking the drug  the protein would go back to normal. You could change the genes in principle. There isn't the technology to do that. But I don't think that's a good idea. And the reason is that these hormones  like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway  they're essential. If you knock them out completely  then you're very sick. So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems. And I think that's much better  that kind of control would be much better as a drug. And also  there are other ways of activating FOXO that don't even involve insulin or IGF   that might even be safer. MR  I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it  but ... There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about  which is a negligible senescence. There are some creatures on this planet already that don't really do aging. Just move to one side for us  if you would. CK  There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age. For example  there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles. And they grow to be about this size. And they've been tagged  and they've been found to be    years old. And when you look at these    year old turtles  you can't tell the difference  just by looking  between those turtles and    year old turtles. And the    year old ones  actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places  and they also have more progeny every year. And there are other examples of these kinds of animals  like turns  certain kinds of birds are like this. And nobody knows if they really can live forever  or what keeps them from aging. It's not clear. If you look at birds  which live a long time  cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide  things like that. And our long lived mutants are too. They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses. So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about  which are set to run really quickly in the worm  have a different normal set point in something like a bird  so that a bird can live a lot longer. And maybe they're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all    but we don't know. MR  But what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death  so much as extending human youthspan. CK  Yes  that's right. It's more like  say  if you were a dog. You notice that you're getting old  and you look at your human and you think   Why isn't this human getting old   They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan. It's more like that. But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human. MR  Thank you very much indeed  Cynthia Kenyon. I'd like to apologize  first of all  to all of you because I have no form of PowerPoint presentation. So what I'm going to do is  every now and again  I will make this gesture  and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy  you can imagine what you'd like to see. I do a radio show. The radio show is called  The Infinite Monkey Cage.  It's about science  it's about rationalism. So therefore  we get a lot of complaints every single week    complaints including one we get very often  which is to say the very title   Infinite Monkey Cage   celebrates the idea of vivisection. We have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy. We also had someone else who said   'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous. An infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of Shakespeare. We know this because they did an experiment.  Yes  they gave    monkeys a typewriter for a week  and after a week  they only used it as a bathroom. So the main element though  the main complaint we get    and one that I find most worrying    is that people say   Oh  why do you insist on ruining the magic  You bring in science  and it ruins the magic.  Now I'm an arts graduate  I love myth and magic and existentialism and self loathing. That's what I do. But I also don't understand how it does ruin the magic. All of the magic  I think  that may well be taken away by science is then replaced by something as wonderful. Astrology  for instance  like many rationalists  I'm a Pisces. Now astrology    we remove the banal idea that your life could be predicted  that you'll  perhaps today  meet a lucky man who's wearing a hat. That is gone. But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions  we still can. We can see predictions of galaxies forming  of galaxies colliding into each other  of new solar systems. This is a wonderful thing. If the Sun could one day    and indeed the Earth  in fact    if the Earth could read its own astrological  astronomical chart  one day it would say   Not a good day for making plans. You'll been engulfed by a red giant.  And that to me as well  that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds  well Many Worlds theory    one of the most beautiful  fascinating  sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation    is a wonderful thing. That every person here  every decision that you've made today  every decision you've made in your life  you've not really made that decision  but in fact  every single permutation of those decisions is made  each one going off into a new universe. That is a wonderful idea. If you ever think that your life is rubbish  always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that. If you ever think   Ah  I want to end it all   don't end it all. Remember that in the majority of universes  you don't even exist in the first place. This to me  in its own strange way  is very  very comforting. Now reincarnation  that's another thing gone    the afterlife. But it's not gone. Science actually says we will live forever. Well  there is one proviso. We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever. Your consciousness  the you ness of you  the me ness of me    that gets this one go. But every single thing that makes us  every atom in us  has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things. We have been mountains and apples and pulsars and other people's knees. Who knows  maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee. That is a good thing. Unlike the occupants of the universe  the universe itself is not wasteful. We are all totally recyclable. And when we die  we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs. This is a wonderful thing. Understanding  to me  does not remove the wonder and the joy. For instance  my wife could turn to me and she may say   Why do you love me   And I can with all honesty look her in the eye and say   Because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors.  Though I'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well. And that is a wonderful thing there. Love does not die because of that thing. Pain doesn't go away either. This is a terrible thing  even though I understand pain. If someone punches me    and because of my personality  this is recently a regular occurrence    I understand where the pain comes from. It is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant    that's what it is. But at no point can I react and go   Ha  Is that the best momentum to energy fourth vector constant you've got   No  I just spit out a tooth. And that is all of these different things    the love for my child. I have a son. His name is Archie. I'm very lucky  because he's better than all the other children. Now I know you don't think that. You may well have your own children and think   Oh no  my child's best.  That's the wonderful thing about evolution    the predilection to believe that our child is best. Now in many ways  that's just a survival thing. The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes  and therefore we love it. But we don't notice that bit  we just unconditionally love. That is a wonderful thing. Though I should say that my son is best and is better than your children. I've done some tests. And all of these things to me give such joy and excitement and wonder. Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework  for instance. Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own. You house is in a terrible state. Your partner is about to return. You think  what should I do  Do nothing. All you have to do is  when she walks in  using a quantum interpretation  say   I'm so sorry. I stopped observing the house for a moment  and when I started observing again  everything had happened.  That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming. For me  it's a very  very important thing. Even on my journey up here    the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time. If you actually think  you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful. I'm sitting on a train. Every time I breathe in  I'm breathing in a million billion billion atoms of oxygen. I'm sitting on a chair. Even though I know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways empty space  I find it comfortable. I look out the window  and I realize that every single time we stop and I look out that window  framed in that window  wherever we are  I am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet Earth. If you go to the safari parks on Saturn or Jupiter  you will be disappointed. And I realize I'm observing this with the brain  the human brain  the most complex thing in the known universe. That  to me  is an incredible thing. And do you know what  that might be enough. Steven Weinberg  the Nobel laureate  once said   The more the universe seems comprehensible  the more it seems pointless.  Now for some people  that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism. But for me  it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing. I'm glad the universe is pointless. It means if I get to the end of my life  the universe can't turn to me and go   What have you been doing  you idiot  That's not the point.  I can make my own purpose. You can make your own purpose. We have the individual power to go   This is what I want to do.  And in a pointless universe  that  to me  is a wonderful thing. I have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation. You  I imagine  can do much better things with your time. Thank you very much. Goodbye. I want to talk to you about something kind of big. We'll start here.    million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day. A chunk of rock six miles across  moving something like    times the speed of a rifle bullet  slammed into the Earth. It released its energy all at once  and it was an explosion that was mind numbing. If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War  lumped them together and blew them up at the same time  that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment. The dinosaurs had a really bad day. Okay  Now  a six mile wide rock is very large. We all live here in Boulder. If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak  you're probably familiar with it. Now  scoop up Long's Peak  and put it out in space. Take Meeker  Mt. Meeker. Lump that in there  and put that in space as well  and Mt. Everest  and K   and the Indian peaks. Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about  okay  We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left. It hit in what we now know as Yucatan  the Gulf of Mexico. You can see here  there's the Yucatan Peninsula  if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there. Here is how big of a crater was left. It was huge. To give you a sense of the scale  okay  there you go. The scale here is    miles on top  a hundred kilometers on the bottom. This thing was     kilometers across        miles    an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet  threw up enough dust to block out the sun. It wiped out    percent of all species on Earth. Now  not all asteroids are that big. Some of them are smaller. Here is one that came in over the United States in October of     . It came in on a Friday night. Why is that important  Because back then  video cameras were just starting to become popular  and people would bring them  parents would bring them  to their kids' football games to film their kids play football. And since this came in on a Friday  they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina  Maryland  Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York. Now  this is not a     mile wide crater  but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here  about the size of a football  that hit that car and did that damage. Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in. It broke up through atmospheric pressure  it crumbled  and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage. Now  you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head  because it would do that to it. That would be bad. But it won't wipe out  you know  all life on Earth  so that's fine. But it turns out  you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage. There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock  and in fact  if any of you have ever been to near Winslow  Arizona  there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater. To give you a sense of scale  this is about a mile wide. If you look up at the top  that's a parking lot  and those are recreational vehicles right there. So it's about a mile across      feet deep. The object that formed this was probably about    to    yards across  so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here. It came in at speeds that were tremendous  slammed into the ground  blew up  and exploded with the energy of roughly a    megaton nuclear bomb    a very hefty bomb. This was        years ago  so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope  or something like that out in the desert  but it probably would not have caused global devastation. It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage. Now  in       over Siberia  near the Tunguska region    for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw  Ghostbusters   when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of       where he got the date wrong  but that's okay.  Laughter  It was     . That's fine. I can live with that. Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground  several miles up above the surface of the Earth. The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it  and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles  okay  This did a huge amount of damage. And again  this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in. In Meteor Crater it was made of metal  and metal is much tougher  so it made it to the ground. The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock  and that's much more crumbly  so it blew up in the air. Either way  these are tremendous explosions     megatons. Now  when these things blow up  they're not going to do global ecological damage. They're not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did. They're just not big enough. But they will do global economic damage  because they don't have to hit  necessarily  to do this kind of damage. They don't have to do global devastation. If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere  it would cause a panic. But if it came over a city  an important city    not that any city is more important than others  but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis    that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization. So  now that I've scared the crap out of you ... what can we do about this  All right  This is a potential threat. Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for    million years. They're very rare. The smaller ones happen more often  but probably on the order of a millennium  every few centuries or every few thousand years  but it's still something to be aware of. Well  what do we do about them  The first thing we have to do is find them. This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in     . It's right here. But you can see that it's extremely faint. I don't even know if you can see that in the back row. These are just stars. This is a rock that was about    yards across  so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona        years ago. These things are faint. They're hard to see  and the sky is really big. We have to find these things first. Well the good news is  we're looking for them. NASA has devoted money to this. The National Science Foundation  other countries are very interested in doing this. We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat. That's a great first step  but what's the second step  The second step is that we see one heading toward us  we have to stop it. What do we do  You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis. If you haven't yet  you will. If you've heard about the Mayan      apocalypse  you're going to hear about Apophis  because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway. Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in     . It's roughly     yards across  so it's pretty big    big size  you know  bigger than a football stadium    and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of     . And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites. The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right  if it passes through this region of space  this kidney bean shaped region called the keyhole  the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April     which is a Friday  I'll note  in the year      ...  Laughter     you can't plan that kind of stuff    Apophis is going to hit us. And it's     meters across  so it would do unbelievable damage. Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million  roughly    very  very low odds  so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all. I don't think Apophis is a problem. In fact  Apophis is a blessing in disguise  because it woke us up to the dangers of these things. This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now. It won't  but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids. We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes  and now we do and it turns out that's really important  because how do you stop an asteroid like this  Well  let me ask you  what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you  What do you do  You do this. Right  Move. The car goes past you. But we can't move the Earth  at least not easily  but we can move a small asteroid. And it turns out  we've even done it. In the year       NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact  which slammed into    slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet. Comets are very much like asteroids. The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way. The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet  which we learned quite a bit about. We did move the comet a little tiny bit  not very much  but that wasn't the point. However  think about this. This thing is orbiting the sun at    miles per second     miles per second. We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay  Imagine how hard that must be  and we did it. That means we can do it again. If we need  if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us  and it's headed right for us  and we have two years to go  boom  We hit it. You can try to    you know  if you watch the movies  you might think about  why don't we use a nuclear weapon  It's like  well  you can try that  but the problem is timing. You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing  you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it. And there are a lot of other problems with that. It's very hard to do. But just hitting something  That's pretty easy. I think even NASA can do that  and they proved that they can.  Laughter  The problem is  what happens if you hit this asteroid  you've changed the orbit  you measure the orbit and then you find out  oh  yeah  we just pushed it into a keyhole  and now it's going to hit us in three years. Well  my opinion is  fine. Okay  It's not hitting us in six months. That's good. Now we have three years to do something else. And you can hit it again. That's kind of ham fisted. You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever  so you don't do that. And this is the part  it's the part I just love. After the big macho  Rrrrrrr BAM  We're gonna hit this thing in the face   then we bring in the velvet gloves. There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B    Foundation. For those of you who've read  The Little Prince   you understand that reference  I hope. The little prince who lived on an asteroid  it was called B   . These are smart guys    men and women    astronauts  like I said  engineers. Rusty Schweickart  who was an Apollo   astronaut  is on this. Dan Durda  my friend who made this image  works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder  on Walnut Street. He created this image for this  and he's actually one of the astronomers who works for them. If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time  we can hit it to move it into a better orbit. But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two. It doesn't have to be huge    couple of tons  not that big    and you park it near the asteroid. You don't land on it  because these things are tumbling end over end. It's very hard to land on them. Instead you get near it. The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe  and the probe has a couple of tons of mass. It has a little tiny bit of gravity  but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid  and you have your rockets set up  so you can    oh  you can barely see it here  but there's rocket plumes    and you basically  these guys are connected by their own gravity  and if you move the probe very slowly  very  very gently  you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit. You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it  although that's a whole other thing. I won't go into that. But we'd be rich  So think about this  right  There are these giant rocks flying out there  and they're hitting us  and they're doing damage to us  but we've figured out how to do this  and all the pieces are in place to do this. We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them. We have smart people  very  very smart people  who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem  and we have the technology to do this. This probe actually can't use chemical rockets. Chemical rockets provide too much thrust  too much push. The probe would just shoot away. We invented something called an ion drive  which is a very  very  very low thrust engine. It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand  incredibly light  but it can run for months and years  providing that very gentle push. If anybody here is a fan of the original  Star Trek   they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive  and Spock said   They're very technically sophisticated. They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive.  Yeah  we have an ion drive now.  Laughter  We don't have the Enterprise  but we've got an ion drive now. Spock. So ... that's the difference  that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs. This happened to them. It doesn't have to happen to us. The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote  and so we can change our future. We have the ability to change our future.    million years from now  we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum. Thank you very much. Let me introduce to you Rezero. This little fellow was developed by a group of    undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH Zurich. Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots. Instead of wheels  a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball. The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground. This means that the robot is inherently unstable. It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot. You might ask yourself  what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable  Now we'll explain that in a second. Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance. Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor. He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately. This happens     times per second  and if anything fails in this process  Rezero would immediately fall to the ground. Now to move and to balance  Rezero needs to turn the ball. The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time. Due to his instability  Rezero is always in motion. Now here's the trick. It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very  dynamically . Let's play a little. You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push. In this mode  he's trying to maintain his position. For the next demo  I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael  on the computer  and Thomas who's helping me onstage. In the next mode  Rezero is passive  and we can move him around. With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity. I can also make him spin. In the next mode  we can get Rezero to follow a person. He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas. This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero. With the same method  we can also get him to circle a person. We call this the orbiting mode. All right  thank you  Thomas. Now  what's the use of this technology  For now  it's an experiment  but let me show you some possible future applications. Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks. With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way. In a hospital  this device could be used to carry around medical equipment. Due to the Ballbot system  it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around. And of course  who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these. And these are more practical applications. But there's also a certain beauty within this technology. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen  gather around. I would love to share with you a story. Once upon a time in   th century Germany  there was the book. Now during this time  the book was the king of storytelling. It was venerable. It was ubiquitous. But it was a little bit boring. Because in its     years of existence  storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device. But then one author arrived  and he changed the game forever. His name was Lothar  Lothar Meggendorfer. Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down  and he said   Genug ist genug   He grabbed his pen  he snatched his scissors. This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold. History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as    who else     the world's first true inventor of the children's pop up book. For this delight and for this wonder  people rejoiced. They were happy because the story survived  and that the world would keep on spinning. Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first to evolve the way a story was told  and he certainly wasn't the last. Whether storytellers realized it or not  they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville  radio news to radio theater  film to film in motion to film in sound  color   D  on VHS and on DVD. There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis. And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around. Because  not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world  but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices. For example  one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine. One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in  D. And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate. And after all this  everyone paused  they took a step back. They realized that  in       years of storytelling  they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls. And this was a cause for celebration. The art of storytelling has remained unchanged. And for the most part  the stories are recycled. But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure  consistent novelty. And they remembered a man  one amazing German  every time a new storytelling device popped up next. And for that  the audience    the lovely  beautiful audience    would live happily ever after. I  like many of you  am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities. And there are days    I don't know about the rest of you guys    but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life. And some days  that can even be a little scary. But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues  if we apply open source collaboration. A couple of years ago  I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment. Now at the time that I was reading this  it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment. So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future. But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article    was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system. So  I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space. And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high quality liquid soil over plants' root systems. Now to a vegetable plant  my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space. But I can offer some natural light and year round climate control. Fast forward two years later  we now have window farms  which are vertical  hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors. And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom  which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top  which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets    so there's no dirt involved. Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate  so a window farm requires a farmer  and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm  and whether she is going to feed her food organically. Back at the time  a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing. And I really wanted it to be an open project  because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto  where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food. So I decided that  instead of creating a product  what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co developers. The first few systems that we created  they kind of worked. We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window. And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers  all kinds of stuff. But the first few systems were these leaky  loud power guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved. So to bring on more co developers  what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs  we explained how they worked  and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems. And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us. So actually now on this website  we have        people. And we have window farms all over the world. What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R D  or research and development. But what we call it is R D I Y  or research and develop it yourself. So for example  Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps. It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right  but once we did  we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half. Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments  like lots of other window farmers  and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients. And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project. So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software. And with every open source project  the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns. So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone. And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers. So for do it yourselfers  we provide free  very well tested instructions so that anyone  anywhere around the world  can build one of these systems for free. And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community. And to fund the project  we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems. Now within our community  a certain culture has appeared. In our culture  it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy. What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work  as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs. But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this  which is the actual joy of collaboration. So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea  built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing. If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people  maybe we just need to ditch the term  consumer  and get behind the people who are doing stuff. Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own. And what we're seeing is that R D I Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems. And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us. And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now. So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united  and to declare that we are all still pioneers. If your life were a book and you were the author  how would you want your story to go  That's the question that changed my life forever. Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert  all I wanted was to be free. I would daydream about traveling the world  living in a place where it snowed  and I would picture all of the stories that I would go on to tell. At the age of     the day after I graduated high school  I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist. With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere. For the first time in my life  I felt free  independent and completely in control of my life. That is  until my life took a detour. I went home from work early one day with what I thought was the flu  and less than    hours later I was in the hospital on life support with less than a two percent chance of living. It wasn't until days later as I lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis  a vaccine preventable blood infection. Over the course of two and a half months I lost my spleen  my kidneys  the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee. When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll. I thought the worst was over until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time. The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot with a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein. I didn't know what to expect  but I wasn't expecting that. With my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces  I strapped on these chunky legs and I stood up. They were so painful and so confining that all I could think was  how am I ever going to travel the world in these things  How was I ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories  as I always wanted  And how was I going to snowboard again  That day  I went home  I crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months  me passed out  escaping from reality  with my legs resting by my side. I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken. But I knew that in order to move forward  I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy. And that is when it dawned on me that I didn't have to be five foot five anymore. I could be as tall as I wanted  Or as short as I wanted  depending on who I was dating. And if I snowboarded again  my feet aren't going to get cold. And best of all  I thought  I can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack.  Laughter  And I did  So there were benefits here. It was this moment that I asked myself that life defining question  If my life were a book and I were the author  how would I want the story to go  And I began to daydream. I daydreamed like I did as a little girl and I imagined myself walking gracefully  helping other people through my journey and snowboarding again. And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder  I could actually feel it. I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment. And that is when a new chapter in my life began. Four months later I was back up on a snowboard  although things didn't go quite as expected  My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when I fell and my legs  still attached to my snowboard   went flying down the mountain  and I was on top of the mountain still. I was so shocked  I was just as shocked as everybody else  and I was so discouraged  but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet that I would be able to do this again. And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things  one  stop us in our tracks or two  force us to get creative. I did a year of research  still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use  couldn't find any resources that could help me. So I decided to make a pair myself. My leg maker and I put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in. As you can see  rusted bolts  rubber  wood and neon pink duct tape. And yes  I can change my toenail polish. It was these legs and the best   st birthday gift I could ever receive   a new kidney from my dad   that allowed me to follow my dreams again. I started snowboarding  then I went back to work  then I went back to school. Then in      I cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports. From there  I had the opportunity to go to South Africa  where I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet so they could attend school. And just this past February  I won two back to back World Cup gold medals   which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world. Eleven years ago  when I lost my legs  I had no idea what to expect. But if you ask me today  if I would ever want to change my situation  I would have to say no. Because my legs haven't disabled me  if anything they've enabled me. They've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities  and that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders  because in our minds  we can do anything and we can be anything. It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits. And although today is about innovation without borders  I have to say that in my life  innovation has only been possible because of my borders. I've learned that borders are where the actual ends  but also where the imagination and the story begins. So the thought that I would like  to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at  our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad  we can begin to look at them as blessings  magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go. It's not about breaking down borders. It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us. Thank you. Meet Tony. He's my student. He's about my age  and he's in San Quentin State Prison. When Tony was    years old  one day  one moment   It was mom's gun. Just flash it  scare the guy. He's a punk. He took some money  we'll take his money. That'll teach him. Then last minute  I'm thinking  'Can't do this. This is wrong.' My buddy says  'C'mon  let's do this.' I say  'Let's do this.'  And those three words  Tony's going to remember  because the next thing he knows  he hears the pop. There's the punk on the ground  puddle of blood. And that's felony murder       to life  parole at    if you're lucky  and Tony's not feeling very lucky. So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say   In this class  we will discuss the foundations of ethics   Tony interrupts me.  What are you going to teach me about right and wrong  I know what is wrong. I have done wrong. I am told every day  by every face I see  every wall I face  that I am wrong. If I ever get out of here  there will always be a mark by my name. I'm a convict  I am branded 'wrong.' What are you going to tell me about right and wrong   So I say to Tony   Sorry  but it's worse than you think. You think you know right and wrong  Then can you tell me what wrong is  No  don't just give me an example. I want to know about wrongness itself  the idea of wrong. What is that idea  What makes something wrong  How do we know that it's wrong  Maybe you and I disagree. Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong. Maybe it's you  maybe it's me    but we're not here to trade opinions  everyone's got an opinion. We are here for knowledge. Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy.  And something changes for Tony.  Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong. I want to know what is wrong. I want to know what I know.  What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy  the project that begins in wonder    what Kant called  admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within.  What can creatures like us know of such things  It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence    what Heidegger called  the always already there.  It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it    what Socrates called  the examined life.  Socrates  a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing. Socrates died in prison  his philosophy intact. So Tony starts doing his homework. He learns his whys and wherefores  his causes and correlations  his logic  his fallacies. Turns out  Tony's got the philosophy muscle. His body is in prison  but his mind is free. Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous  the epistemologically anxious  the ethically dubious  the metaphysically ridiculous. That's Plato  Descartes  Nietzsche and Bill Clinton. So when he gives me his final paper  in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure  I say   I don't know. Let us think about that.  Because in that moment  there's no mark by Tony's name  it's just the two of us standing there. It is not professor and convict  it is just two minds ready to do philosophy. And I say to Tony   Let's do this.  Thank you. My subject today is learning. And in that spirit  I want to spring on you all a pop quiz. Ready  When does learning begin  Now as you ponder that question  maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten  the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher. Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork. Maybe you've encountered the Zero to Three movement  which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones. And so your answer to my question would be  Learning begins at birth. Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible  but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology. And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born  while we're still in the womb. Now I'm a science reporter. I write books and magazine articles. And I'm also a mother. And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called  Origins.   Origins  is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins. Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago  and it's based on the theory that our health and well being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb. Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me. I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book. And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it. When we hold our babies for the first time  we might imagine that they're clean slates  unmarked by life  when in fact  they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in. Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they're still in their mothers' bellies. First of all  they learn the sound of their mothers' voices. Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus  the voices fetuses hear  starting around the fourth month of gestation  are muted and muffled. One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher in the old  Peanuts  cartoon. But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body  reaching the fetus much more readily. And because the fetus is with her all the time  it hears her voice a lot. Once the baby's born  it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's. How can we know this  Newborn babies can't do much  but one thing they're really good at is sucking. Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples  so that if a baby sucks on one  it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones  and if it sucks on the other nipple  it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice. Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one. Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored. This is how researchers discovered that  after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss'  The Cat in the Hat  while they were pregnant  their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb. My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born. So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into. A study published last year found that from birth  from the moment of birth  babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language. French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note  imitating the melodic contours of those languages. Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful  It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival. From the moment of birth  the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it    its mother. It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language  which may further endear the baby to the mother  and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language. But it's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero. It's also tastes and smells. By seven months of gestation  the fetus' taste buds are fully developed  and its olfactory receptors  which allow it to smell  are functioning. The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid  which is continuously swallowed by the fetus. Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world. In one experiment  a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy  while another group of pregnant women drank only water. Six months later  the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice  and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it. The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal  and from the looks of it  they seemed to enjoy it more. A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon  France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life  and again  when they were tested later  on their fourth day of life. Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as  yuck.  What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat. Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining through one of culture's most powerful expressions  which is food. They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture's cuisine even before birth. Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons. But before I get to that  I want to address something that you may be wondering about. The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus    like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly. But actually  the nine month long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that. Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life    the air she breathes  the food and drink she consumes  the chemicals she's exposed to  even the emotions she feels    are shared in some fashion with her fetus. They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body  makes them part of its flesh and blood. And often it does something more. It treats these maternal contributions as information  as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside. So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's  Magic Flute  but answers to questions much more critical to its survival. Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity  Will it be safe and protected  or will it face constant dangers and threats  Will it live a long  fruitful life or a short  harried one  The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind. The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus' brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility  our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments  from the country to the city  from the tundra to the desert. To conclude  I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born. In the autumn of       the darkest days of World War II  German troops blockaded Western Holland  turning away all shipments of food. The opening of the Nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades    so cold the water in the canals froze solid. Soon food became scarce  with many Dutch surviving on just     calories a day    a quarter of what they consumed before the war. As weeks of deprivation stretched into months  some resorted to eating tulip bulbs. By the beginning of May  the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted. The specter of mass starvation loomed. And then on May  th        the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies. The  Hunger Winter   as it came to be known  killed some        people and weakened thousands more. But there was another population that was affected    the        fetuses in utero during the siege. Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths  birth defects  low birth weights and infant mortality. But others wouldn't be discovered for many years. Decades after the  Hunger Winter   researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity  more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions. These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways. They have higher blood pressure  poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance    a precursor of diabetes. Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later  One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation. When food is scarce  they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ  the brain  and away from other organs like the heart and liver. This keeps the fetus alive in the short term  but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs  deprived early on  become more susceptible to disease. But that may not be all that's going on. It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly. They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb. The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it. And the basis of the fetus' prediction is what its mother eats. The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story  a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation. This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems    an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival. Faced with severely limited resources  a smaller sized child with reduced energy requirements will  in fact  have a better chance of living to adulthood. The real trouble comes when pregnant women are  in a sense  unreliable narrators  when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty. This is what happened to the children of the Dutch  Hunger Winter.  And their higher rates of obesity  diabetes and heart disease are the result. Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post war Western diet. The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born. Here's another story. At      a.m. on September   th        there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York    commuters spilling off trains  waitresses setting tables for the morning rush  brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.       of these people were pregnant women. When the planes struck and the towers collapsed  many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster    the overwhelming chaos and confusion  the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris  the heart pounding fear for their lives. About a year after       researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack. In the babies of those women who developed post traumatic stress syndrome  or PTSD  following their ordeal  researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD    an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester. In other words  the mothers with post traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero. Now consider this  post traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong  causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering. But there's another way of thinking about PTSD. What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances. In a particularly dangerous environment  the characteristic manifestations of PTSD    a hyper awareness of one's surroundings  a quick trigger response to danger    could save someone's life. The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative  but I find it rather poignant. It would mean that  even before birth  mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there  telling them   Be careful.  Let me be clear. Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy. It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well being of the next generation. That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb. Learning is one of life's most essential activities  and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined. Thank you. Good afternoon. As you're all aware  we face difficult economic times. I come to you with a modest proposal for easing the financial burden. This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT. He was struggling to explain something to me  a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter. Now he confused me from the very start  because light doesn't cool things down. It makes it hotter. It's happening right now. The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than     quintillion photons  and they're moving randomly through the space  near the speed of light. All of them are different colors  they're rippling with different frequencies  and they're bouncing off every surface  including me  and some of those are flying directly into your eyes  and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here. Now a laser is different. It also uses photons  but they're all synchronized  and if you focus them into a beam  what you have is an incredibly useful tool. The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye  you can use it to store massive amounts of data  and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain. First you trap atoms in a special bottle. It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment. And the atoms themselves are quite violent  but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency  an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down. Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero. Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough  something truly bizarre happens. It's no longer a solid  a liquid or a gas. It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid. The atoms lose their individual identity  and the rules from the quantum world take over  and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties. For example  if you shine light through a superfluid  it is able to slow photons down to    kilometers per hour. Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction  so if you were to take the lid off that bottle  it won't stay inside. A thin film will creep up the inside wall  flow over the top and right out the outside. Now of course  the moment that it does hit the outside environment  and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree  it immediately turns back into normal matter. Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered. And this is the great pleasure of science  the defeat of our intuition through experimentation. But the experiment is not the end of the story  because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people. I have a Ph.D in molecular biology. I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about. So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment  it seemed like the more he said  the less I understood. Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea  to really capture its essence  the fewer words you use  the better. In fact  the ideal may be to use no words at all. I remember thinking  my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance. Of course  there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them. Now  the idea is not as crazy as it sounds. I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D. Instead of explaining their research with words  scientists have to explain it with dance. Now surprisingly  it seems to work. Dance really can make science easier to understand. But don't take my word for it. Go on the Internet and search for  Dance Your Ph.D.  There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you. The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research. For example  at the University of Minnesota  there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde  and he works with dancers to study how cells move. They do it by changing their shape. When a chemical signal washes up on one side  it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side  because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment. So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions. But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside is really more like chaos inside  because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers  and those fibers are constantly falling apart. But just as quickly as they explode  more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer  so it's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same. Now  David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab  but before he does that  he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place. It's basically efficient brainstorming  and when I visited David to learn about his research  he used dancers to explain it to me rather than the usual method  PowerPoint. And this brings me to my modest proposal. I think that bad PowerPoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy. Now it does depend on how you measure it  of course  but one estimate has put the drain at     million dollars per day. Now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of        dollars  and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time  and given that there are some apparently    million PowerPoint presentations created every day  that would indeed add up to an annual waste of     billion dollars. Of course  that's just the time we're losing sitting through presentations. There are other costs  because PowerPoint is a tool  and like any tool  it can and will be abused. To borrow a concept from my country's CIA  it helps you to soften up your audience. It distracts them with pretty pictures  irrelevant data. It allows you to create the illusion of competence  the illusion of simplicity  and most destructively  the illusion of understanding. So now my country is    trillion dollars in debt. Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money. One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts. For example  our National Endowment for the Arts  with its      million budget  slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one thousandth of a percent. One certainly can't argue with those numbers. However  once we eliminate public funding for the arts  there will be some drawbacks. The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed. Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution  and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods. All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place. I shall now  therefore  humbly propose my own thoughts  which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. Once we eliminate public funding for the artists  let's put them back to work by using them instead of PowerPoint. As a test case  I propose we start with American dancers. After all  they are the most perishable of their kind  prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system. Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds  we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems. Imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank. It's sure to help. Of course someday  in the deep future  a technology of persuasion even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented  rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric. However  I trust that by that day  we shall have passed this present financial calamity. Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion. Now when we think of our senses  we don't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved  from a biological perspective. We don't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses  but that's probably why our senses really evolved    to keep us safe  to allow us to live. Really when we think of our senses  or when we think of the loss of the sense  we really think about something more like this  the ability to touch something luxurious  to taste something delicious  to smell something fragrant  to see something beautiful. This is what we want out of our senses. We want beauty  we don't just want function. And when it comes to sensory restoration  we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty. And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today. Likewise for hearing. When we think about why we hear  we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren  although clearly that's an important thing. Really what we want to hear is music. So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Many of you know that he was deaf  or near profoundly deaf  when he wrote that. Now I'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music. Music is just one of the strangest things that there is. It's acoustic vibrations in the air  little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum. Somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones  which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music. That process is entirely abstract and very  very unusual. And we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out  how is it that we hear something that's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air  Turns out that if you have hearing loss  most people that lose their hearing lose it at what's called the cochlea  the inner ear. And it's at the hair cell level that they do this. Now if you had to pick a sense to lose  I have to be very honest with you and say  we're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is. In fact  nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing. And as a physician and a surgeon  I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose  we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing. As a musician  I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant  I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken  because I know that music would never sound the same to me. Now this is a video that I'm going to show you of a girl who's born deaf. She's in a very supportive environment. Her mother's doing everything she can. Okay  play that video please. Owl  yeah. Owl. Owl. Yeah. Baby. Baby. You want it  Charles Limb  Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning  there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf  an infant who was born deaf  has in this world in terms of social  educational  vocational opportunities. I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful  wonderful life. I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face. Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past     years. I mean literally  they used to do things like stick ear shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in. And that was the best you could do for hearing loss. Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum. So it's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss. And now today we have the modern multi channel cochlear implant  which is an outpatient procedure. It's surgically placed inside the inner ear. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours  depending on where it's done  under general anesthesia. And in the end  you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea. Now actually  this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear. But here is that same girl who is implanted now. This is her    years later. And this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor  Dr. John Niparko  who implanted her. If we could play this video please. Girl  I have written two books.  Mother  Was the other one a book or a journal entry   Girl  No  the other one was a book.  Mother  Oh  okay.  JN  Well this book has seven chapters  and the last chapter is entitled  The Good Things About Being Deaf.  Do you remember writing that chapter  Girl  Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter. JN  Yeah. Girl  Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying. So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her. JN  I see. And who is that  Girl  Holly.  JN  Okay.  Mother  Her sister.  JN  Her sister.  Girl  My sister. JN  And how can you avoid being annoyed by her  Girl  I just take off my CI  and I don't hear anything. It comes in handy. JN  So you don't want to hear everything that's out there  Girl  No. CL  And so she's phenomenal. And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success. It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine. However  despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language  you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all. In fact  most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad. And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody's life  we have a long way to go when it comes to audition. Now there are a lot of reasons for that. I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it's abstract. Language is very different. Language is very precise. In fact  the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic specificity. When you say a word  what you care is that word was perceived correctly. You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken. Music is entirely different. When you hear music  if it doesn't sound good  what's the point  There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you. The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language. And you can see on this figure  that the frequency range and the decibel range  the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous. So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant  what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission. Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing. If you can hear music  you should be able to hear anything. Now the problems begin first with pitch perception. I mean  most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music. And without the ability to perceive pitch well  music and melody is a very difficult thing to do    forget about a harmony and things like that. Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude. Now if we could just play this. Okay  now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves  let's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone. We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users. Go ahead and play this one. Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation. You distort it a little bit  especially in terms of pitch  and you've changed it. And it might be that you kind of like that. That's kind of hypnotic. But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended. And you're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing. Now the other issue comes with  not just the ability to tell pitches apart  but the ability to tell sounds apart. Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument. If we could play these two sound clips in succession. The trumpet. And the second one. That's a violin. These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments. Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments. The sound quality  or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre  tone color    they cannot tell these things whatsoever. This implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth. Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech  have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody  what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech. You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech  they were designed for speech. But actually if you look at melody  what you find is that there's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls. So for whatever reason  this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception. Now the next question is  well how does it really sound  Now we've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users. I'm going to play you two clips of Usher  one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies  almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies. Go ahead and play that. I had patients tell me that those sound the same. They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips. Again  we are very  very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. Now the question comes to mind  Is there any hope  And yes  there is hope. Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is. This is ... does somebody know  This is Beethoven. Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like  Because his grave was exhumed. And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness  which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there. But Beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing. What that suggests is that  even in the case of hearing loss  the capacity for music remains. The brains remain hardwired for music. I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants. This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. Text  Beethoven doesn't excite her. The       Overture  isn't worth waking for. But she jumps to action when called to duty  CL  Now I'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it. I'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance  even in a cat. If we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music    because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that  no rehabilitative strategies  very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music    we would come a long way. Now I want to show you one last video. And this is of a student of mine named Joseph who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab. He's deaf  and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant. And here's a video of Joseph. And at about four months old  I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss. Not long after  I was fitted with hearing aids. But although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time  they weren't very helpful. So as a result  I had to rely on lip reading a lot  and I couldn't really hear what people were saying. When I was    years old  I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation. And not long after I got my cochlear implant  I started learning how to play piano. And it was absolutely wonderful. Since then  I've never looked back. CL  Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant. He is now a medical student at Yale University  and he's contemplating a surgical career    one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery. There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere. And this is really unheard of stuff  and this is all because of this technology. And the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain. Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant  because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time. You don't actually have to hear it. I know he doesn't hear well  because I've heard him do Karaoke. And it's one of the most awful things    heartwarming  but awful. And so there is certainly a lot of hope  but there's a lot more that needs to be done. So I just want to conclude with the following words. When it comes to restoration of hearing  we have certainly come a long way  a remarkably long way. And we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing. And let me tell you right now  it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech. But I tell you  if we lost our hearing  if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing  you would want perfect hearing back. You wouldn't want decent hearing  you would want perfect hearing. Restoration of basic sensory function is critical. And I don't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function. But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring. And I don't think that we should give up on beauty. And I want to thank you for your time. So that's Johnny Depp  of course. And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder. And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo. Some of you might know that  in       Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder  and he had tattooed on his right shoulder  Winona forever.  And then three years later    which in fairness  kind of is forever by Hollywood standards    they broke up  and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done. And now his shoulder says   Wino forever.  So like Johnny Depp  and like    percent of Americans between the ages of    and     I have a tattoo. I first started thinking about getting it in my mid   s  but I deliberately waited a really long time. Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were    or    or    and regretted it by the time they were   . That didn't happen to me. I got my tattoo when I was     and I regretted it instantly. And by  regretted it   I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place    this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side    and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street. Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares. And then I went home that night  and I had an even larger emotional meltdown  which I'll say more about in a minute. And this was all actually quite shocking to me  because prior to this moment  I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets. I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions  of course. I do that hourly. But I had always felt like  look  you know  I made the best choice I could make given who I was then  given the information I had on hand. I learned a lesson from it. It somehow got me to where I am in life right now. And okay  I wouldn't change it. In other words  I had drunk our great cultural Kool Aid about regret  which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time  that we should always look forward and not backward  and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets. This idea is nicely captured by this quote   Things without all remedy should be without regard  what's done is done.  And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first    something we might all agree to sign onto ... until I tell you who said it. Right  so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people. And as it happens  Shakespeare was onto something here  as he generally was. Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths. It's also  by the way  a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage. So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions. So if  in fact  you want to live a life free of regret  there is an option open to you. It's called a lobotomy. But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane  I think you need to learn to live  not without regret  but with it. So let's start off by defining some terms. What is regret  Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past. So in other words  regret requires two things. It requires  first of all  agency    we had to make a decision in the first place. And second of all  it requires imagination. We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice  and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present. And in fact  the more we have of either of these things    the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret  the more acute that regret will be. So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic  and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight. You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by   . Why  Well because  if you miss your flight by three minutes  it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome.  I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel. I should have gone through that yellow light.  These are the classic conditions that create regret. We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly  but almost came out well. Now within that framework  we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things. This session today is about behavioral economics. And most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain. We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them    buyer's remorse  basically. But then finally  it occurred to some researchers to step back and say  well okay  but overall  what do we regret most in life  Here's what the answers turn out to look like. So top six regrets    the things we regret most in life  Number one by far  education.    percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education. We wish we'd gotten more of it. We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have. We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic. Others very high on our list of regrets include career  romance  parenting  various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time    or actually more specifically  how we fail to spend our leisure time. The remaining regrets pertain to these things  finance  family issues unrelated to romance or parenting  health  friends  spirituality and community. So in other words  we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance. But it turns out  when you look overall at what people regret in life  you know what  our financial decisions don't even rank. They account for less than three percent of our total regrets. So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap  or company A versus company B  or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius  you know what  let it go. Odds are  you're not going to care in five years. But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around  what does that experience feel like  We all know the short answer. It feels terrible. Regret feels awful. But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial. When I went home that night after getting my tattoo  I basically stayed up all night. And for the first several hours  there was exactly one thought in my head. And the thought was   Make it go away   This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response. I mean  it's right up there with   I want my mommy   We're not trying to solve the problem. We're not trying to understand how the problem came about. We just want it to vanish. The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was   How could I have done that  What was I thinking   This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret. We can't identify with that part. We don't understand that part. And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part    which explains the third consistent component of regret  which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. That's why  in the face of our regret  the thing we consistently say is   I could have kicked myself.  The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing. Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night  thinking   Make it go away.  It's that I sat there and I thought   Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away.  So if you look at the psychological literature  these are the four consistent defining components of regret. But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one. And I think of this as a kind of existential wake up call. That night in my apartment  after I got done kicking myself and so forth  I lay in bed for a long time  and I thought about skin grafts. And then I thought about how  much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God  probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy. In point of fact  no insurance covers acts of idiocy. The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured  they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of  frankly  a fairly indifferent universe. This is obviously an incredibly painful experience. And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control Z culture    Control Z like the computer command  undo. We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities  in a certain sense. We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem    we can undo and unfriend and unfollow. And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot. Sometimes instead of Control Z  we actually have zero control. And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists    and I know where of I speak    this is really hard  because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right. Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos  and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes. But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about. So for instance  here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life. Text  Relpy to all. And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing  we can experience a huge range of regret. You can accidentally hit  reply all  to an email and torpedo a relationship. Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work. Or you can have your last day at work. And this doesn't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life. Because of course  sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences  either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods  and in the very worst case scenario  even their lives. Now obviously  those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring. I mean  even the stupid  reply all  regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. So how are we supposed to live with this  I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret. And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality. If you Google regret and tattoo  you will get   .  million hits. The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos     percent of us regret getting them. That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends. And that's just regret about tattoos. We are all in this together. The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves. Now in my case  this really wasn't a problem  because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're    years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. I don't think that's the case though. All of us who've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive. It connects the poles of our lives back together  the positive and the negative  and it sends a little current of life back into us. The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time  which  as we know  heals all wounds    except for tattoos  which are permanent. So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo. And do you guys just want to see it  All right. Actually  you know what  I should warn you  you're going to be disappointed. Because it's actually not that hideous. I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something. When other people see my tattoo  for the most part they like how it looks. It's just that I don't like how it looks. And as I said earlier  I'm a perfectionist. But I'll let you see it anyway. This is my tattoo. I can guess what some of you are thinking. So let me reassure you about something. Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are. I got this tattoo because I spent most of my   s living outside the country and traveling. And when I came and settled in New York afterward  I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time. Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and  simultaneously  how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north. And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image. And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. Well it did. But it turns out  it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would  it reminds me constantly of something else instead. It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us  which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us. And ironically  I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body    partly as a writer  but also just as a human being. Here's the thing  if we have goals and dreams  and we want to do our best  and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them  we should feel pain when things go wrong. The point isn't to live without any regrets. The point is to not hate ourselves for having them. The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this  We need to learn to love the flawed  imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them. Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly. It reminds us that we know we can do better. Thank you. Good afternoon  I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can  and actually is changing the world  and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote  or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers  a Monty Python type of sketch. Here it is. It is December         . Somebody gives you a bet  you will look at a crystal ball  and you will see the future  the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. OK  curiosity killed the cat  you take the bet  you look at the crystal ball. One hour later  you're sitting in a building of the national TV  in a top show  and you tell the story. Before the end of       Ben Ali  and Mubarak  and Gaddafi would be down  and prosecuted. Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged  or already on their knees. Osama bin Laden would be dead  and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague. Now  the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face. And then  on top of it you add   And thousands of young people from Athens  Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice  claiming they are inspired by Arabs.  Next thing you know  two guys in white appear  they give you the strange t shirt  take you to the nearest mental institution. So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power. Well  people power has been there for a while. It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India  it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle. It helped a local  Lech Walesa  to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland  and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it. So what's new in it  What seems to be very new  which is the idea I would like to share with you today  is that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle. If this is true  we can help these movements. Well  the first one   analytic skills. I'll try where it all started in the Middle East. And for so many years  we were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East. It was looking like the frozen region. Literally a refrigerator. And there were only two types of meal there. Steak  which stands for a Mubarak Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship  or a potato  which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies. And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened  and millions of young  mainly secular people stepped out to do the change. Guess what   they didn't watch the demographics. What is the average age of an Egyptian    . How long was Mubarak in power    . So  this system was just obsolete  they expired. And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning  and understood that power lies in their hands. The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what  The same Generation Y  with their rules  with their tools  with their games  and with their language  which sounds a little bit strange to me. I'm    now. And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe  It seems that Generation Y is coming. Now  let me set another example. I'm meeting different people throughout the world  and they are  you know  academics  and professors  and doctors  and they will always talk conditions. They will say   People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive.  They will say   People power will work  if the annual income of the country is between X and Z.  They will say   People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure.  They will say   People power will work only if there is no oil.  And  I mean  there is a set of conditions. Well  the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. Namely  the skills of unity  planning  and maintaining nonviolent discipline. Let me give you an example. I come from a country called Serbia. It took us    years to unite    opposition party leaders  with their big egos  behind one single candidate against the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Guess what  That was the day of his defeat. You look at the Egyptians  they fight on Tahrir Square  they get rid of their individual symbols  they appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt. I will give you a counter example. You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko  you all know the outcome. So unity is a big thing. And this can be achieved. Same with planning. Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution. That thing doesn't exist in the world. Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military  somebody was thinking about it before. Now  at the end  nonviolent discipline. And this is probably the game changer. If you maintain nonviolent discipline  you'll exclusively win. You have         people in a nonviolent march  one idiot or agent provocateur throwing a stone. Guess what takes all the cameras. That one guy. One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement. Now  let me move to another place. It's the selection of strategies and tactics. There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow. First  you start small. Second  you pick the battles you can win. It's only     of us in this room. We won't call for the march of a million. But what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night  all over Krakow. The city will know. So  we pick tactics accommodated to the event  especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion. They're very useful in violent oppression. We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used. It was on Tahrir square  where the international community was constantly frightened that  you know  the Islamists will overtake the revolution. What they organized    Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying  a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims  the world has just changed the picture  but somebody was thinking about this previously. So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place  shouting  and you know  showing off in front of the security forces. Now  there is also another very important dynamic. And this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see. This is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side  and enthusiasm and humor on another side. So  it works like in a video game. You have the fear high  you have status quo. You have the enthusiasm higher  you see the fear is starting to melt. Day two  you see people running towards the police instead of from the police  in Egypt. You can tell that something is happening there. And then  it's about the humor. Humor is such a powerful game changer  and of course  it was very big in Poland. You know  we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit. We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait of Mr. President on it  in the middle of the Main Street. There was a hole in the top. So you could literally come  put a coin in  get a baseball bat  and hit his face. Sounds loud. And within minutes  we were sitting in a nearby caf  having coffee  and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing. Well  that's just the beginning of the show. The real show starts when the police appears.  What will they do   Arrest us  We were nowhere to be seen. We were like three blocks away  observing it from our espresso bar. Arrest the shoppers  with kids  Doesn't make sense. Of course  you could bet  they did the most stupid thing. They arrested the barrel. And now  the picture of the smashed face on the barrel  with the policemen dragging it to the police car  that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have. So  I mean  these are the things you can do. And you can always use humor. There is also one big thing about humor  it really hurts. Because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously. When you start to mock them  it hurts. Now  everybody is talking about His Majesty  the Internet  and it is also a very useful skill. But don't rush to label things like  a Facebook Revolution    Twitter Revolution.  Don't  confuse  the tools with the substance. It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper. They also make it a bit safer for the participants  because they give partial anonymity. We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do. It can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. This is the famous group  We are all Khaled Said   made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt  and his friend. This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police. This is how he became known to the public  and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back. But here is also the bad news. The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world  in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy  or  you know  the economy  if you sit down and click. There are risks to be taken  and there are living people who are winning the struggle. Well  the million dollar question. What will happen in the Arab world  And though young people from the Arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators  shaking the region  kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco to do substantial reforms  it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome. Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition  or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts  whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline  faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already  or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war. Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds  We cannot tell. The same works for the Western sector  where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world  occupying this  occupying that. Are they going to become the world wave  Are they going to find their skills  their enthusiasm  and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform  or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate  This is the difference between the two paths. Now  what do the statistics have  My friend Maria Stephan's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle  and there are some shocking data. If you look at the last    years and different social transitions  from dictatorship to democracy  you will see that  out of    different cases  in    of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power. This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon  this is one more reason to look at Generation Y. Enough for me to give them credit  and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world. Thank you. How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this  How many of you found it really  really annoying  Okay  outstanding. So I invented that. Or I was one of the people who did it. That thing is called a CAPTCHA. And the reason it is there is to make sure you  the entity filling out the form  are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times. The reason it works is because humans  at least non visually impaired humans  have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters  whereas computer programs simply can't do it as well yet. So for example  in the case of Ticketmaster  the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets  two at a time. CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet. And since they're used so often  a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate. So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page. The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W  A  I  T  which  of course  spell a word. But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about    minutes later. Text   Help  I've been waiting for over    minutes  and nothing happens.  This person thought they needed to wait. This of course  is not as bad as this poor person. CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over    years ago  and it's been used everywhere. Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later  which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA. This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA  which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon  then we turned it into a startup company. And then about a year and a half ago  Google actually acquired this company. So let me tell you what this project started. So this project started from the following realization  It turns out that approximately     million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world. When I first heard this  I was quite proud of myself. I thought  look at the impact that my research has had. But then I started feeling bad. See here's the thing  each time you type a CAPTCHA  essentially you waste    seconds of your time. And if you multiply that by     million  you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about         hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs. So then I started feeling bad. And then I started thinking  well  of course  we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs  because the security of the Web sort of depends on them. But then I started thinking  is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity  So see  here's the thing. While you're typing a CAPTCHA  during those    seconds  your brain is doing something amazing. Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do. So can we get you to do useful work for those    seconds  Another way of putting it is  is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve  yet we can split into tiny    second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem  And the answer to that is  yes   and this is what we're doing now. So what you may not know is that nowadays while you're typing a CAPTCHA  not only are you authenticating yourself as a human  but in addition you're actually helping us to digitize books. So let me explain how this works. So there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books. Google has one. The Internet Archive has one. Amazon  now with the Kindle  is trying to digitize books. Basically the way this works is you start with an old book. You've seen those things  right  Like a book  So you start with a book  and then you scan it. Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book. It gives you an image for every page of the book. This is an image with text for every page of the book. The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image. That's using a technology called OCR  for optical character recognition  which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect. Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow  OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words. For example  for things that were written more than    years ago  the computer cannot recognize about    percent of the words. So what we're doing now is we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet. So the next time you type a CAPTCHA  these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize. And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because  you see  one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book  it didn't know what it was  and it's going to present it to you. But since it doesn't know the answer for it  it cannot grade it for you. So what we do is we give you another word  one for which the system does know the answer. We don't tell you which one's which  and we say  please type both. And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer  it assumes you are human  and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly. And if we repeat this process to like    different people and all of them agree on what the new word is  then we get one more word digitized accurately. So this is how the system works. And basically  since we released it about three or four years ago  a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books. So for example  Ticketmaster. So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster  you help to digitize a book. Facebook  Every time you add a friend or poke somebody  you help to digitize a book. Twitter and about         other sites are all using reCAPTCHA. And in fact  the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we're digitizing per day is really  really large. It's about     million a day  which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year. And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet. Now of course  since we're doing so many words per day  funny things can happen. And this is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other. So funny things can happen. For example  we presented this word. It's the word  Christians   there's nothing wrong with it. But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word  bad things can happen. So we get this.  Text  bad christians  But it's even worse  because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God. Oops. Here's another really bad one. JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday. Now  of course  we're not just insulting people. See here's the thing  since we're presenting two randomly chosen words  interesting things can happen. So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in  which is called CAPTCHA art. I'm sure some of you have heard about it. Here's how it works. Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar  like this CAPTCHA.  Text  invisible toaster  Then what you're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it. Then of course  you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book. But then  first you take a screen shot  and then you draw something that is related to it. That's how it works. There are tens of thousands of these. Some of them are very cute.  Text  clenched it  Some of them are funnier. And some of them  like paleontological shvisle  they contain Snoop Dogg. Okay  so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA. So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project. This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA      million  which is a little over    percent of the world's population  has helped us digitize human knowledge. And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda. So the question that motivates my research is the following  If you look at humanity's large scale achievements  these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically    like for example  building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon    there is a curious fact about them  and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people. It's weird  they were all done with about         people. And the reason for that is because  before the Internet  coordinating more than         people  let alone paying them  was essentially impossible. But now with the Internet  I've just shown you a project where we've gotten     million people to help us digitize human knowledge. So the question that motivates my research is  if we can put a man on the Moon with          what can we do with     million  So based on this question  we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on. Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about. This is something that we've been semi quietly working on for the last year and a half or so. It hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo. Since it hasn't been launched  shhhhh  Yeah  I can trust you'll do that. So this is the project. Here's how it started. It started with me posing a question to my graduate student  Severin Hacker. Okay  that's Severin Hacker. So I posed the question to my graduate student. By the way  you did hear me correctly  his last name is Hacker. So I posed this question to him  How can we get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free  Okay  so there's a lot of things to say about this question. First of all  translating the Web. So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages. A large fraction of it is in English. If you don't know any English  you can't access it. But there's large fractions in other different languages  and if you don't know those languages  you can't access it. So I would like to translate all of the Web  or at least most of the Web  into every major language. So that's what I would like to do. Now some of you may say  why can't we use computers to translate  Why can't we use machine translation  Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there. Why can't we use it to translate the whole Web  Well the problem with that is that it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next    to    years. It makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't make a mistake  since it makes so many mistakes  you don't know whether to trust it or not. So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine. Actually it was a forum post. It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript. It was translated from Japanese into English. So I'll just let you read. This person starts apologizing for the fact that it's translated with a computer. So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question. So he's just explaining something. Remember  it's a question about JavaScript. Then comes the first part of the question. Then comes my favorite part of the question. And then comes the ending  which is my favorite part of the whole thing. Okay  so computer translation  not yet good enough. So back to the question. So we need people to translate the whole Web. So now the next question you may have is  well why can't we just pay people to do this  We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web. We could do that. Unfortunately  it would be extremely expensive. For example  translating a tiny  tiny fraction of the whole Web  Wikipedia  into one other language  Spanish. Wikipedia exists in Spanish  but it's very small compared to the size of English. It's about    percent of the size of English. If we wanted to translate the other    percent into Spanish  it would cost at least    million dollars    and this is at even the most exploited  outsourcing country out there. So it would be very expensive. So what we want to do is we want to get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free. Now if this is what you want to do  you pretty quickly realize you're going to run into two pretty big hurdles  two big obstacles. The first one is a lack of bilinguals. So I don't even know if there exists     million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate. That's a big problem. The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation. How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free  Normally  you have to pay people to do this. So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free  Now when we were starting to think about this  we were blocked by these two things. But then we realized  there's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution. There's a way to kill two birds with one stone. And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do  and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals  and that is language education. So it turns out that today  there are over  .  billion people learning a foreign language. People really  really want to learn a foreign language. And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. For example  in the United States alone  there are over five million people who have paid over      for software to learn a new language. So people really  really want to learn a new language. So what we've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website    it's called Duolingo    where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web. And so basically they're learning by doing. So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner  we give you very  very simple sentences. There's  of course  a lot of very simple sentences on the Web. We give you very  very simple sentences along with what each word means. And as you translate them  and as you see how other people translate them  you start learning the language. And as you get more and more advanced  we give you more and more complex sentences to translate. But at all times  you're learning by doing. Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works. First of all  people are really  really learning a language. We're mostly done building it  and now we're testing it. People really can learn a language with it. And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software. So people really do learn a language. And not only do they learn it as well  but actually it's way more interesting. Because you see with Duolingo  people are actually learning with real content. As opposed to learning with made up sentences  people are learning with real content  which is inherently interesting. So people really do learn a language. But perhaps more surprisingly  the translations that we get from people using the site  even though they're just beginners  the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators  which is very surprising. So let me show you one example. This is a sentence that was translated from German into English. The top is the German. The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid    cents a word for this translation. And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo  none of whom knew any German before they started using the site. You can see  it's pretty much perfect. Now of course  we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators. We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator. Now even though we're combining the translations  the site actually can translate pretty fast. So let me show you  this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish. Remember  this is    million dollars worth of value. So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish  we could do it in five weeks with         active users. And we could do it in about    hours with a million active users. Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users  we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project. Now the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education. So here's the thing  The current business model for language education is the student pays  and in particular  the student pays Rosetta Stone     dollars. That's the current business model. The problem with this business model is that    percent of the world's population doesn't have     dollars. So it's extremely unfair towards the poor. This is totally biased towards the rich. Now see  in Duolingo  because while you learn you're actually creating value  you're translating stuff    which for example  we could charge somebody for translations. So this is how we could monetize this. Since people are creating value while they're learning  they don't have to pay their money  they pay with their time. But the magical thing here is that they're paying with their time  but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language. So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model    one that doesn't discriminate against poor people. So here's the site. Thank you. So here's the site. We haven't yet launched  but if you go there  you can sign up to be part of our private beta  which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks. We haven't yet launched this Duolingo. By the way  I'm the one talking here  but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team  some of whom are here. So thank you. I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them. Spiders are truly global citizens. You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat. This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America  and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators. Here's one of our field sites  and just to give you a sense of perspective  this little blue smudge here  that's one of my collaborators. This is a rugged and barren landscape  yet there are quite a few spiders here. Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle. Spiders are not just everywhere  but they're extremely diverse. There are over        described species of spiders. To put that number into perspective  here's a graph comparing the        species of spiders to the     species of primates. There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates. Spiders are also extremely old. On the bottom here  this is the geologic timescale  and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present  so the zero here  that would be today. So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost     million years. To put that into perspective  this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees  a mere seven million years ago. All spiders make silk at some point in their life. Most spiders use copious amounts of silk  and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk  as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for     million years. It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. Spiders use silk for many purposes  including the trailing safety dragline  wrapping eggs for reproduction  protective retreats and catching prey. There are many kinds of spider silk. For example  this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. When you look at this orb web  you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk  while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks  the filament and the sticky droplet. How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk  To answer that  you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. So silk comes out of the spinnerets  and for those of us spider silk biologists  this is what we call the  business end  of the spider.  Laughter  We spend long days ... Hey  Don't laugh. That's my life. We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. And this is what we see. You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets  because each spinneret has many spigots on it. Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot  and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider  what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb web weaving spider  and I hope you do  what you would find is a bounty of beautiful  translucent silk glands. Inside each spider  there are hundreds of silk glands  sometimes thousands. These can be grouped into seven categories. They differ by size  shape  and sometimes even color. In an orb web weaving spider  you can find seven types of silk glands  and what I have depicted here in this picture  let's start at the one o'clock position  there's tubuliform silk glands  which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac. There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web. Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement    that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. There's also aciniform silk  which is used to wrap prey. Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction. And the most studied silk line of them all  major ampullate silk. This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web  and also the safety trailing dragline. But what  exactly  is spider silk  Spider silk is almost entirely protein. Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family  so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family  so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk  and over the last     million years  that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged  specialized  over and over and over again  to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today. There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design  such as they're all very long    they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins. They're very repetitive  and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine. To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like  this is a dragline silk protein  it's just a portion of it  from the black widow spider. This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night.  Laughter  So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids  and I've colored in the glycines with green  and the alanines in red  and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again  so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines  or iterated A's  AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words  and these words occur in sentences. So for example this would be one sentence  and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine  that repeats over and over and over again  and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule. Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. At the top of the screen  you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. It's short. And on the bottom  this is the repeat sequence for the egg case  or tubuliform silk protein  for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are    so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence. So I've colored in the glycines again in green  alanine in red  and the serines  the letter S  in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red  and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple. What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences  these amino acid sequences  to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. Now  it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body. This makes testing spider silk really  really easy to do in the laboratory  because we're actually  you know  testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing  which is basically  you know  tugging on one end of the fiber  very amenable. Here are stress strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider. So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. Specifically  if you look on the vertical axis  that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers  you can see that there's a lot of variation  and in fact dragline  or major ampullate silk  is the strongest of these fibers. We think that's because the dragline silk  which is used to make the frame and radii for a web  needs to be very strong. On the other hand  if you were to look at strain    this is how much a fiber can be extended    if you look at the maximum value here  again  there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform  or the capture spiral filament. In fact  this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length. So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. In the case of the capture spiral  it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. If it wasn't able to stretch so much  then basically when an insect hit the web  it would just trampoline right off of it. So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk  an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really  really stretchy capture spiral silk  the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. We call that the tool kit of a spider. That's what the spider has to interact with their environment. But how about variation among spider species  so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders  This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you. This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by    species of spiders. Some of them are orb weaving spiders and some of them are non orb weaving spiders. It's been hypothesized that orb weaving spiders  like this argiope here  should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey. What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph  the higher the toughness. The    species are indicated here by this phylogeny  this evolutionary tree  that shows their genetic relationships  and I've colored in yellow the orb web weaving spiders. If you look right here at the two red arrows  they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus. These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins. Yet  their draglines are not the toughest. In fact  the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region  a non orb web weaving spider. This is the dragline spun by scytodes  the spitting spider. Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead  scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it  and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk like venom onto that insect. Think of hunting with silly string. That's how scytodes forages. We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline  but it's unexpected results like this that make bio prospecting so exciting and worthwhile. It frees us from the constraints of our imagination. Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber  bombyx    or domesticated silkworm silk    wool  Kevlar  and carbon fibers. And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them. It's the combination of strength  extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special  and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists  so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. And the strength  extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response  have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications  for example  as a component of artificial tendons  for serving as guides to regrow nerves  and for scaffolds for tissue growth. Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities. Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks  personally  I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. I love when I'm in the laboratory  a new spider silk sequence comes in. That's just the best.  Laughter  It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me  and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. The next time you see a spider web  please  pause and look a little closer. You'll be seeing one of the most high performance materials known to man. To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte  silk is terrific. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last    years    one  three     years    I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea  this concept  noninvasive surgery  from the research lab to routine clinical use. And this is what I'll tell you about.    years    for some of you  you can empathize with that number. For me  today  on this date  it's like a second bar mitzvah experience. So this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies. One is the focused ultrasound  and the other one is the vision enabled magnetic resonance imaging. So let's first talk about focused ultrasound. And I hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom. It is made out of silicon. It is transparent  made just for you. So you see  it's all intact  completely transparent. I'll take you now to the acoustic lab. You see the phantom within the aquarium. This is a setup I put in a physics lab. On the right hand side  you see an ultrasonic transducer. So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom. Okay  when you hear the click  this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom. Okay  so everything around it is whole and intact. It's just a lesion formed inside. So think about  this is in your brain. We need to reach a target inside the brain. We can do it without harming any tissue. So this is  I think  the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system. Okay  so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound  the force of ultrasound. You know all about imaging  right  ultrasound imaging. And you know also about lithotripsy    breaking kidney stones. But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between  because it's a mechanical force. Basically  it's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses. So you can change the intensity  the frequency  the duration  the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer. And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing  physically focusing. So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all. When I was born  this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the Fry brothers and Lars Leksell  who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife. But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain  noninvasively  with focused ultrasound in the '  s. He failed  so he then invented the gammaknife. And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed. And there was something fundamental that they were missing. They were missing the vision. It wasn't until the invention of the MR and really the integration of MR with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback    both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive  closed loop surgical procedure. So this is how it looks  you know  the operating room of the future today. This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system. And I will give you several examples. So the first one is in the brain. One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders  like Parkinson's or essential tremor. What is typical to those conditions  to essential tremor for example  is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you  or write legibly so people can understand it  and be really independent in your life without the help of others. So I'd like you to meet John. John is a retired professor of history from Virginia. So he suffered from essential tremor for many years. And medication didn't help him anymore. And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain. And about four or five months ago  he underwent an experimental procedure. It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus. And this is his handwriting.  On June   th   if you can read it       .  This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I'll take you through  what  a typical procedure like that looks like   what  noninvasive surgery looks like. So we put the patient on the MR table. We attach a transducer  in this case  to the brain  but if it will be a different organ  it will be a different transducer attached to the patient. And the physician will then take a regular MR scan. And the objective of that  I don't have a pointer here  but you see the green  sort of rectangle or trapezoid  This is the sort of general area of the treatment. It's a safety boundary around the target. It's a target in the thalamus. So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on  he selects basically a point    you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is    and he presses this blue button called  sonicate.  We call this instance of injecting the energy  we call it sonication. The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse. This is the only device he needs in this treatment. So he presses  sonicate   and this is what happens. You see the transducer  the light blue. There's water in between the skull and the transducer. And it does this burst of energy. It elevates the temperature. We first need to verify that we are on target. So the first sonication is at lower energy. It doesn't do any damage  but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees. And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively. This is really a unique capability of the MR. It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging. But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time. And you can see the points there on the graph. The temperature was raised to    degrees C temporarily. This doesn't cause any damage. But the point is we are right on target. So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen  then we move to perform a full energy ablation like you see here. And you see the temperature rises to like    to    degrees C. If you do it for more than a second  it's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells. This is the outcome from a patient perspective    same day after the treatment. This is an immediate relief. Thank you. John is one of  about  a dozen very heroic  courageous people who volunteered for the study. And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk. And this is a quote from John after he wrote it. He said   Miraculous.  And his wife said   This is the happiest moment of my life.  And you wonder why. I mean  one of the messages I like to carry over is  what about defending quality of life  I mean  those people lose their independence. They are dependent on others. And John today is fully independent. He returned to a normal life routine. And he also plays golf  like you do in Virginia when you are retired. Okay  so you can see here the spot. It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain. There's no damage outside. He suffers from no neurodeficit. There's no recovery needed  no nothing. He's back to his normal life. Let's move now to a more painful subject. Pain is something that can make your life miserable. And people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain  lower back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases  when the metastases get to your bones  sometimes they are very painful. All those I've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain  again  very fast. And I would like to tell you about PJ. He's a    year old farmer who suffered from    how should I say it     it's called pain in the butt. He had metastases in his right buttock  and he couldn't sit even with medication. He had to forgo all the farm activities. He was treated with radiation therapy  state of the art radiation therapy  but it didn't help. Many patients like that favor radiation therapy. And again  he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide  also in the U.S. And his wife actually took him. They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital. He had to sit on a cushion  stand still  not move  because it was very painful. He took the treatment  and on the way back  he drove the truck by himself. So again  this is an immediate relief. And you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens. He returned again to his daily routine on the farm. He rides his tractor. He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly. And he has been very happy. But now  you ask me  but what about war  the war on cancer  Show us some primary cancer. What can be done there  So I have good news and bad news. The good news  there's a lot that can be done. And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S. And doing that in the U.S. is very painful. I don't see  without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen  it will not happen. And it's not just because of regulation  it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen. So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer. They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound. And we have better than surgery results in breasts. But I have a message for the men here. We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer. There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR  because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy    treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland  and by that  avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence. Well  there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen    quite lethal  very lethal actually    pancreas  liver  kidney. The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient    and in all our treatments  the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician    is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time. And this will take time. This will take two years. But I have now a message to the ladies. And this is  in       the FDA has approved MR guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. Women suffer from that disease. All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods  abdominal pressure  back pain  frequent urination. And sometimes  they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid. This is Frances. She was diagnosed with a grapefruit sized fibroid. This is a big fibroid. She was offered a hysterectomy  but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option. So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in     . And in       she became a first time mother to a healthy baby. So new life was born. So in conclusion  I'd like to leave you with actually four messages. One is  think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery  and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large    and I think also from their physicians  by the way. And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table  who  is awake and can even monitor the treatment. In all our treatments  the patient holds a stop sonication button. He can stop the surgery at any moment. And with that note  I would like to thank you for listening. Okay  I have no idea what we're going to play. I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens. I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before. So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. Okay  so first of all  let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums  Burniss Travis on the bass  and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. So the bandstand  as we call it  this is an incredible space. It is really a sacred space. And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future  or the past. You really are alive right here in this moment. There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand. We had no idea what key we were going to play in. In the middle  we sort of made our way into a song called  Titi Boom.  But that could have happened    maybe  maybe not. Everyone's listening. We're responding. You have no time for projected ideas. So the idea of a mistake  From the perspective of a jazz musician  it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake. So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand    first of all  we don't really see it as a mistake. The only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. Every  mistake  is an opportunity in jazz. So it's hard to even describe what a funny note would be. So for example  if I played a color  like we were playing on a palette  that sounded like this ... So if Christian played a note    like play an F. See  these are all right inside of the color palette. If you played an E. See  these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting. If you played an F  though  to most people's ears  they would perceive that as a mistake. So I'm going to show you  we're going to play just for a second. And we're going to play on this palette. And at some point  Christian will introduce this note. And we won't react to it. He'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop  I'll talk for a second. We'll see what happens when we play with this palette. So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake. The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it. It was an opportunity that was missed. So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again. He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it  but something will change. We'll all accept his ideas  or not. So you see  he played this note. I ended up creating a melody out of it. The texture changed in the drums this time. It got a little bit more rhythmic  a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it. So there is no mistake. The only mistake is if I'm not aware  if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity. So jazz  this bandstand is absolutely amazing. It's a very purifying experience. And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted. We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing. So how does this all relate to behavioral finance  Well we're jazz musicians  so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. Anyway  I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it. And the other dynamic of it is that we don't micromanage in jazz. You have some people who do. But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities. If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way  and I just jump right in ... ready  just play some time. One  two  one  two  three  four. It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas. I'm telling them   You come with me over this way.  If I really want the music to go there  the best way for me to do it is to listen. This is a science of listening. It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do. So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity  the first step for me is to be patient  to listen to what's going on and pull from something that's going on around me. When you do that  you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more  and gradually it builds. Watch. One  two  a one  two  three  four. Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas. It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced. It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that. It's about being here in the moment  accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow. Thank you. My travels to Afghanistan began many  many years ago on the eastern border of my country  my homeland  Poland. I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales. A land where every field hides a grave  where millions of people have been deported or killed in the   th century. Behind the destruction  I found a soul of places. I met humble people. I heard their prayer and ate their bread. Then I have been walking East for    years    from Eastern Europe to Central Asia    through the Caucasus Mountains  Middle East  North Africa  Russia. And I ever met more humble people. And I shared their bread and their prayer. This is why I went to Afghanistan. One day  I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. I was alone on foot. And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport. But he gave me a cup of tea. And I understood that his surprise was my protection. So I have been walking and traveling  by horses  by yak  by truck  by hitchhiking  from Iran's border to the bottom  to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. And in this way I could find noor  the hidden light of Afghanistan. My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. I heard prayers of the Sufi    humble Muslims  hated by the Taliban. Hidden river  interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India. The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears  and welcomed as a gift. What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect  about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium  These are opium addicted people on the roofs of Kabul    years after the beginning of our war. These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. What do we know about the women    years after the war  Clothed in this nylon bag  made in China  with the name of burqa. I saw one day  the largest school in Afghanistan  a girls' school.        girls studying here in the rooms underground  full of scorpions. And their love  for studying  was so big that I cried. What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh  The region is not secure  but full of the Taliban  and they did it. My aim is to give a voice to the silent people  to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game  the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. Thanks. I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine  and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved. Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single  solo inventor who  working late in the lab one night  makes an earthshaking discovery  and voila  overnight everything's changed. That's a very appealing picture  however  it's just not true. In fact  medicine today is a team sport. And in many ways  it always has been. I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work. I'm a surgeon  and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light. When I make an incision inside a patient's body  it's dark. We need to shine light to see what we're doing. And this is why  traditionally  surgeries have always started so early in the morning    to take advantage of daylight hours. And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms  they have been on top of buildings. For example  this is the oldest operating room in the Western world  in London  where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in. And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America. This is Mass General in Boston. And do you know where the operating room is  Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in. So nowadays in the operating room  we no longer need to use sunlight. And because we no longer need to use sunlight  we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room. We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights    lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see. And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence. So let me back up a little bit. When we are in medical school  we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything's color coded. Nerves are yellow  arteries are red  veins are blue. That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon  right  However  when we have a real patient on the table  this is the same neck dissection    not so easy to tell the difference between different structures. We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society  what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute. Well if cancer can be caught early  enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out  excised with surgery  I don't care if it has this gene or that gene  or if it has this protein or that protein  it's in the jar. It's done  it's out  you're cured of cancer. This is how we excise cancers. We do our best  based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience  we say  you know what  the cancer's gone. We've made a good job. We've taken it out. That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table. But then we actually don't know that it's all out. We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed  what's left behind in the patient  and then send those bits to the pathology lab. In the meanwhile  the patient's on the operating room table. The nurses  anesthesiologist  the surgeon  all the assistants are waiting around. And we wait. The pathologist takes that sample  freezes it  cuts it  looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room. And that may be    minutes later per piece. So if you've sent three specimens  it's an hour later. And very often they say   You know what  points A and B are okay  but point C  you still have some residual cancer there. Please go cut that piece out.  So we go back and we do that again  and again. And this whole process   Okay you're done. We think the entire tumor is out.  But very often several days later  the patient's gone home  we get a phone call   I'm sorry  once we looked at the final pathology  once we looked at the final specimen  we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive. There's still cancer in your patient.  So now you're faced with telling your patient  first of all  that they may need another surgery  or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy. So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell  if the surgeon could really tell  whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field  I mean  in many ways  the way that we're doing it  we're still operating in the dark. So in       during my surgical residency  I had the great fortune to meet Dr. Roger Tsien  who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry in     . Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer  and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with. The molecule they had developed had three parts. The main part of it is the blue part  polycation  and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body. So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer  everything's going to get lit up. Nothing will be specific. There's no specificity there. So they added two additional components. The first one is a polyanionic segment  which basically acts as a non stick backing like the back of a sticker. So when those two are together  the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down. And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors    for example  the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make. So here in this situation  if you make a solution full of this three part molecule along with the dye  which is shown in green  and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer  normal tissue can't cut it. The molecule passes through and gets excreted. However  in the presence of the tumor  now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site. And now  boom  the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent. So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it. Can you tell where the tumor is  I couldn't when I was working on this. But here it is. It's fluorescent. Now it's green. See  so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is. We can tell in the operating room  in the field  at a molecular level  where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out. And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright  it actually can shine through tissue. The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue. So even if the tumor is not right on the surface  you'll still be able to see it. In this movie  you can see that the tumor is green. There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that  And I'm peeling that muscle away. But even before I peel that muscle away  you saw that there was a tumor underneath. So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules. That you can  not only see the margins right there on a molecular level  but you can see it even if it's not right on the top    even if it's beyond your field of view. And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also. Sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer  melanoma. Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes. But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol  the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer. And then if that node has cancer  the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection. So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer  the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery. But sentinel lymph node  the way that we do it today  is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go. So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station  you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road. It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas. You have to cut it out  bring it back home  cut it up  look inside and say   Oh yes  it does have gas.  So that takes more time. Patients are still on the operating room table. Anesthesiologists  surgeons are waiting around. That takes time. So with our technology  we can tell right away. You see a lot of little  roundish bumps there. Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others. Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold  That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside. Well with our technology  the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer. I won't go into this very much  but our technology  besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence  we can also use the same smart three part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively. The patient has cancer  you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in. Well you can see this on an MRI. So in surgery  it's important to know what to cut out. But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function. So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury. And what I'm talking about are nerves. Nerves  if they are injured  can cause paralysis  can cause pain. In the setting of prostate cancer  up to    percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction. That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems    and this is even in so called nerve sparing surgery  which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem  and they are trying to avoid the nerves. But you know what  these little nerves are so small  in the context of prostate cancer  that they are actually never seen. They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature. And they're known because somebody has decided to study them  which means that we're still learning about where they are. Crazy to think that we're having surgery  we're trying to excise cancer  we don't know where the cancer is. We're trying to preserve nerves  we can't see where they are. So I said  wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence  And at first this didn't get a lot of support. People said   We've been doing it this way for all these years. What's the problem  We haven't had that many complications.  But I went ahead anyway. And Roger helped me. And he brought his whole team with him. So there's that teamwork thing again. And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves. And when we made a solution of this  tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse  their nerves literally glowed. You can see where they are. Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse  and you can see that that big  fat portion you can see very easily. But in fact  at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now  there's actually very fine arborizations that can't really be seen. You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out. We have been able to see nerves for facial expression  for facial movement  for breathing    every single nerve    nerves for urinary function around the prostate. We've been able to see every single nerve. When we put these two probes together ... So here's a tumor. Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is  Now you do. What about the nerve that's going into this tumor  That white portion there is easy to see. But what about the part that goes into the tumor  Do you know where it's going  Now you do. Basically  we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field. This was a bit of a breakthrough. I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery. We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology. We received commentary in Discover magazine  in The Economist. And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues. They said   Wow  I have patients who would benefit from this. I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications.  What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room. The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients. However  we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one time use. Understandably  the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple use drugs  such as long term daily medications. We are focused on making this technology better. We're focused on adding drugs  adding growth factors  killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue. We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it. I'd like to leave you with this final thought. Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough. It is not a sprint. It is not an event for the solo runner. Successful innovation is a team sport  it's a relay race. It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted. And this takes the long term steady courage of the day in day out struggle to educate  to persuade and to win acceptance. And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today. Thank you very much. I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet  so those invoices don't get issued. But we need to do something about this problem. I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest  but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature  and which doesn't get priced by the markets. A project called TEEB was started in       and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G   . And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. They asked themselves a question  If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change  well why can't the same be done for conservation  Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature  And the answer is  Yeah  it can. But it's not that straightforward. Biodiversity  the living fabric of this planet  is not a gas. It exists in many layers  ecosystems  species and genes across many scales    international  national  local  community    and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. And yet  we began. We began the project with an interim report  which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many  many researchers. And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that  in fact  we were losing natural capital    the benefits that flow from nature to us. We were losing it at an extraordinary rate    in fact  of the order of two to four trillion dollars worth of natural capital. This came out in       which was  of course  around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss. We then have gone on since to present for  the  international community  for governments  for local governments and for business and for people  for you and me  a whole slew of reports  which were presented at the U.N. last year  which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. What is this about  A picture that you're familiar with    the Amazon rainforests. It's a massive store of carbon  it's an amazing store of biodiversity  but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory. Because the northeastern trade winds  as they go over the Amazonas  effectively gather the water vapor. Something like    billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds  and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. This rainfall cycle  this rainfall factory  effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of     billion dollars worth in Latin America. But the question arises  Okay  so how much do Uruguay  Paraguay  Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas  which produces that rainfall  And the answer is zilch  exactly zero. That's the economic invisibility of nature. That can't keep going on  because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful. Economics has become the currency of policy. And unless we address this invisibility  we are going to get the results that we are seeing  which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. It's not just about the Amazonas  or indeed about rainforests. No matter what level you look at  whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level  we see the same problem again and again. So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level. At the species level  it's been estimated that insect based pollination  bees pollinating fruit and so on  is something like     billion dollars worth. That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally. It completely passes below the radar screen. But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice  Or for that matter  if you look at the genetic level     percent of medicines were prospected  were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. Once again  most of that doesn't get paid. And that brings me to another aspect of this  which is  to whom should this get paid  That genetic material probably belonged  if it could belong to anyone  to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule  which then became the medicine. They were the ones that didn't get paid. And if you look at the species level  you saw about fish. Today  the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor  the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods  to feed their families. Something like a billion people depend on fish  the quantity of fish in the oceans. A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein. And at this rate at which we are losing fish  it is a human problem of enormous dimensions  a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before. And finally  at the ecosystem level  whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests  or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats  or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest  it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil  India and Indonesia  even though ecosystem services    these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free    they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP    two  four  eight         percent    but in these countries  if we measure how much they're worth to the poor  the answers are more like    percent     percent     percent. That's the difference. Because these are important benefits for the poor. And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset  the most important asset  which is your development asset  that is ecological infrastructure. How bad can things get  Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. It's basically a measure of how many tigers  toads  ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. The green represents the percentage. If you start green  it's like    to     percent. If it's yellow  it's    to    percent. And these are percentages versus the original state  so to speak  the pre industrial era      . Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. And just watch the change in colors in India  China  Europe  sub Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. See that again. The only places that remain green    and that's not good news    is  in fact  places like the Gobi Desert  like the tundra and like the Sahara. But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. This is the challenge. The reason this is happening boils down  in my mind  to one basic problem  which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth  it's common goods. And here's an example from Thailand where we found that  because the value of a mangrove is not that much    it's about      over the life of nine years that this has been measured    compared to its value as a shrimp farm  which is more like         there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. But of course  if you look at exactly what those profits are  almost       of those dollars are  in fact  subsidies. So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like       to    . That's not that hard. But on the other hand  if you start measuring  how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use  Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects  that answer is more like         of cost. And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries  the fish nurseries  that provide fish for the poor  that answer is more like        . So now look at the different lens. If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits  you get a completely different answer  which is clearly conservation makes more sense  and not destruction. So is this just a story from South Thailand  Sorry  this is a global story. And here's what the same calculation looks like  which was done recently    well I say recently  over the last    years    by a group called TRUCOST. And they calculated for the top       corporations  what are the externalities  In other words  what are the costs of doing business as usual  This is not illegal stuff  this is basically business as usual  which causes climate changing emissions  which have an economic cost. It causes pollutants being issued  which have an economic cost  health cost and so on. Use of freshwater. If you drill water to make coke near a village farm  that's not illegal  but yes  it costs the community. Can we stop this  and how  I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. Basically the stuff of life is natural capital  and we need to recognize and build that into our systems. When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level  we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. When we measure corporate performances  we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society. That has to stop. In fact  this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. That was in the early     s when India was going gung ho about GDP growth as the means forward    looking at China with its stellar growths of eight  nine     percent and wondering  why can we do the same  And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense. This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. Calculating this at the national level is one thing  and it has begun. And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES    Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. But calculating this at the next level  that means at the business sector level  is important. And actually we've done this with the TEEB project. We've done this for a very difficult case  which was for deforestation in China. This is important  because in China in       the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. Just a year later the Yangtze flooded  causing something like       deaths. So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. It was associated largely with the construction industry. And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling. A retrospective on    years shows that if we had accounted for these costs    the cost of loss of topsoil  the cost of loss of waterways  the lost productivity  the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors  desertification and so on    those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. So in fact  the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. Of course  after the event one can be wise. The way to do this is to do it on a company basis  to take leadership forward  and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost  and to disclose these answers. Someone once asked me   Who is better or worse  is it Unilever or is it P G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia   And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies  good though they are and professional though they are  do not calculate or disclose their externalities. But if we look at companies like PUMA    Jochen Zeitz  their CEO and chairman  once challenged me at a function  saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it. Well I think we kind of did it at the same time  but he's done it. He's basically worked the cost to PUMA. PUMA has  .  billion dollars of turnover      million dollars of profits      million dollars after tax     million dollars of externalities  cost to business. Now that's not a happy situation for them  but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say   Here's what we are measuring. We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure.  That's an example  I think  for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from. If more companies did this  and if more sectors engaged this as sectors  you could have analysts  business analysts  and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. Today we can't yet do that  but I think the path is laid out. This can be done. And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K. has already set up a coalition to do this  an international coalition. The other favorite  if you like  solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. And by the way  these are my favorites    externalities calculation and green carbon markets. TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco certification and you name it  but these are the favorites. What's green carbon  Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. It's about energy emissions. The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. It's not doing too well. We've over issued. A bit like inflation  you over issue currency  you get what you see  declining prices. But that's all about energy and industry. But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon  that is soot. What we're also missing is blue carbon  which  by the way  is the largest store of carbon    more than    percent. Thankfully  the flux  in other words  the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa  is more or less balanced. In fact  what's being absorbed is something like    percent of our emissions  which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans. More of that in a minute. And finally  there's deforestation  and there's emission of methane from agriculture. Green carbon  which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions  and blue carbon together comprise    percent of our emissions. We have the means already in our hands  through a structure  through a mechanism  called REDD Plus    a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme. So we actually have some movement forward. But the thing is to do a lot more of that. Will this solve the problem  Will economics solve everything  Well I'm afraid not. There is an area that is the oceans  coral reefs. As you can see  they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia  Malaysia  India  Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean. These red dots  these red areas  basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. So that's almost an eighth of society. And the sad thing is that  as these coral reefs are lost    and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above     parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs    we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species  the warm water corals  we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans  but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than     million people who live in the developing world in poor countries. So in selecting targets of     parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations  what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs. Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. Let's think about it and what it means  but please  let's not do more of that. Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. Thank you. Ben Roche  So I'm Ben  by the way. Homaro Cantu  And I'm Homaro. BR  And we're chefs. So when Moto opened in       people didn't really know what to expect. A lot of people thought that it was a Japanese restaurant  and maybe it was the name  maybe it was the logo  which was like a Japanese character  but anyway  we had all these requests for Japanese food  which is really not what we did. And after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll  we decided to give the people what they wanted. So this picture is an example of printed food  and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation. So this is all the ingredients  all the flavor of  you know  a standard maki roll  printed onto a little piece of paper. HC  So our diners started to get bored with this idea  and we decided to give them the same course twice  so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish. So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood. The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some cr me fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish.  Laughter  BR  But it's not all just edible pictures. We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar    so in this case  we have carrot cake. So we take a carrot cake  put it in a blender  and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice  and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream  I guess  and it comes off looking like  you know  Jupiter's floating around your plate. So yeah  we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for. HC  And here's something we have no reference to eat. This is a cigar  and basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of a Cuban pork sandwich  so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder  we fashion that into ash. We take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green  put an edible label that bears no similarity to a Cohiba cigar label  and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it.  Laughter  HC  Delicious. BR  That's not it  though. Instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn't eat  we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know. So this is a plate of nachos. The difference between our nachos and the other guy's nachos  is that this is actually a dessert. So the chips are candied  the ground beef is made from chocolate  and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese. And after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this  of these ingredients  we realized that it was pretty cool  because as we served it  we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing  where the cheese begins to melt. So when you're looking at this thing in the dining room  you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos  and it's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert  and it's just kind of like a mind ripper. HC  So we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic's shop than a kitchen  and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory  and that's what we have here. So we put this in the basement  and we got really serious about food  like serious experimentation. BR  One of the really cool things about the lab  besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen  is that  you know  with this new equipment  and this new approach  all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open  and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created  they just kept going further and further out there. HC  Let's talk about flavor transformation  and let's actually make some cool stuff. You see a cow with its tongue hanging out. What I see is a cow about to eat something delicious. What is that cow eating  And why is it delicious  So the cow  basically  eats three basic things in their feed  corn  beets  and barley  and so what I do is I actually challenge my staff with these crazy  wild ideas. Can we take what the cow eats  remove the cow  and then make some hamburgers out of that  And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  that's our chef de cuisine  Chris Jones. This is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task  but a lot of these ideas  they're hard to understand. They're hard to just get automatically. There's a lot of research and a lot of failure  trial and error    I guess  more error    that goes into each and every dish  so we don't always get it right  and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people. HC  So  after about a day of Chris and I staring at each other  we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty  and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat. This is made from three ingredients  beets  barley  corn  and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat  looks and tastes like hamburger meat  and not only that  but it's basically removing the cow from the equation. So replicating food  taking it into that next level is where we're going. BR  And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger  which is a cool side effect. And a miracle berry  if you're not familiar with it  is a natural ingredient  and it contains a special property. It's a glycoprotein called miraculin  a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it  but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue  so that primarily sour taste receptors  so normally things that would taste very sour or tart  somehow begin to taste very sweet. HC  You're about to eat a lemon  and now it tastes like lemonade. Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that. We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas  and we can replace it with all natural fresh fruit. BR  So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles  wasted energy  and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna  or any exotic produce or item from a very far away place  with local  organic produce  so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin. HC  So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things  we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon  and it makes it go from sweet to savory. So after we do that  we put it into a vacuum bag  add a little bit of seaweed  some spices  and we roll it  and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna. So the key now is to make it behave like tuna. BR  And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear  we really have something that looks  tastes and behaves like the real thing. HC  So the key thing to remember here is  we don't really care what this tuna really is. As long as it's good for you and good for the environment  it doesn't matter. But where is this going  How can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology  So here's the next challenge. I told the staff  let's just take a bunch of wild plants  think of them as food ingredients. As long as they're non poisonous to the human body  go out around Chicago sidewalks  take it  blend it  cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at Moto. Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  so you can imagine  a task like this    this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for. But we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general  because these are ingredients  you know  plant life that we're  one  unfamiliar with  and two  we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don't eat them. So we really had to think about new  creative ways to flavor  new ways to cook and to change texture    and that was the main issue with this challenge. HC  So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead. So developing nations and first world nations  imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them  food miles would basically turn into food feet. This disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are  even if we just swapped out  say  one of these for flour  that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste. And to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers  there's a bale of hay there and some crab apples. And basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients. People swore they were eating barbecue sauce  and this is free food. BR  Thanks  guys. I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than    years. So bear with me as I take you through this journey. When I was    years old  I came home from work  put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run. I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever. While I was preparing my dog for the run  a man was finishing drinking at a bar  picked up his car keys  got into a car and headed south  or wherever he was. I was running across the street  and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head. And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth. What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog. She ended up underneath the car. I flew out in front of the car  and then he ran over my legs. My left leg got caught up in the wheel well    spun it around. The bumper of the car hit my throat  slicing it open. I ended up with blunt chest trauma. Your aorta comes up behind your heart. It's your major artery  and it was severed  so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth. It foamed  and horrible things were happening to me. I had no idea what was going on  but strangers intervened  kept my heart moving  beating. I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it. Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there. And my lung collapsed  so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening. Somehow I ended up at the hospital. I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug induced coma.    months later I woke up. I was blind  I couldn't speak  and I couldn't walk. I was    lbs. The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that. And in fact  they started to call me a Gomer. That's another story we won't even get into. I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together  to repair my heart a few times. Some things worked  some things didn't. I had lots of titanium put in me  cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way. And I ended up with a plastic nose  porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things. But eventually I started to look human again. But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things  so bear with me. I had more than    surgeries. But who's counting  So eventually  the hospital decided it was time for me to go. They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through. Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover. So they basically put a map up on the wall  threw a dart  and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado. And I know all of you are scratching your head   A senior citizens' home  What in the world are you going to do there   But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now  that's what a senior home has. So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had. The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom  because they had a long life. And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life. But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep  At that point  I had gained four pounds  so I was    lbs. I was bald. I was wearing hospital scrubs. And somebody donated tennis shoes for me. And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting. So they pulled back and they were looking at each other  and they were going   Okay  what skills do we have in this room  This kid needs a lot of work.  So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs. But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away. I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being  since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins. So I had to go through trying to eat again. And they went through that process. And then they had to figure out   Well she needs furniture. She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment.  So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture    gave me pots and pans  blankets  everything. And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover. So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints. We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back. But I did say no to the blue hair. So eventually what went on is they decided that  well I need to learn to speak. So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see. So they figured not being able to see is one thing  but they need to get me to talk. So while Sally  the office manager  was teaching me to speak in the day    it's hard  because when you're a kid  you take things for granted. You learn things unconsciously. But for me  I was an adult and it was embarrassing  and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips  and capture the air and get the word out. So I acted like a two year old and refused to work. But the men had a better idea. They were going to make it fun for me. So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night  and then  secretly  how to swear like a sailor. So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built. So I moved on from there. And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write. The redundancy was actually good for me. So we'll just keep moving on. One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person. So close your eyes. Now imagine you have to cross a street. You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth  and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation. So there were two obstacles I had to get through. One was post traumatic stress disorder. And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic. And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. So one of the seniors just came up to me  and she pushed me up to the corner and she said   When you think it's time to go  just stick the cane out there. If it's hit  don't cross the street.  Made perfect sense. But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road  they realized that they needed to put the resources together  and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person  and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life. And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me  and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.    years later I gained my sight back. Not magically. I opted in for three surgeries  and one of them was experimental. It was actually robotic surgery. They removed a hematoma from behind my eye. The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward  that there were innovations and all kinds of new things    cellphones  laptops  all these things that I had never seen before. And as a blind person  your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell. So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster. So I was walking around it. And I go   I'm just going to touch it.  And I touched it and I went   Oh my God  it's a laundry basket.  So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted. But when you're blind  you have the tactile memory for things. The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost    years of my life. I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends. But when I looked down  I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up  so I got going on it. We didn't have words like crowd sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident. But the concept held true    people working with people to rebuild me  people working with people to re educate me. I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration. Thank you so much. I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds. The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind. We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence  yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder. We should  in fact  because without having this possibility of conscious minds  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world. We would have no pains  but also no joys. We would have no access to love or to the ability to create. And of course  Scott Fitzgerald said famously that  he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for.  But he also forgot that without consciousness  he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence. So much for the wonder  now for the mystery. This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate. All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience  this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation  has got major controversies. And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it  we should just leave it alone  it's not to be solved. I don't believe that  and I think the situation is changing. It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains  but we certainly can begin to approach the question  and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do  for example  what you're seeing right now. These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab  and which show you  in a living brain  the reconstruction of that brain. And this is a person who is alive. This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy. And even more    and this is something that one can be really amazed about    is what I'm going to show you next  which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections  real pathways. So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons  the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses. And I'm sorry to disappoint you  they don't come in color. But at any rate  they are there. The colors are codes for the direction  from whether it is back to front or vice versa. At any rate  what is consciousness  What is a conscious mind  And we could take a very simple view and say  well  it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams  or when we go under anesthesia  and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia. But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia  or when we are in deep  dreamless sleep  Well first of all  it is a mind  which is a flow of mental images. And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns  visual  such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me  or auditory images  as you are having now in relation to my words. That flow of mental images is mind. But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room. We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images. We have selves. We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now. We own our minds. And we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this    not the person who is sitting next to you. So in order to have a conscious mind  you have a self within the conscious mind. So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it. The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind  and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind. So what we need to know to even address this mystery is  number one  how are minds are put together in the brain  and  number two  how selves are constructed. Now the first part  the first problem  is relatively easy    it's not easy at all    but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience. And it's quite clear that  in order to make minds  we need to construct neural maps. So imagine a grid  like the one I'm showing you right now  and now imagine  within that grid  that two dimensional sheet  imagine neurons. And picture  if you will  a billboard  a digital billboard  where you have elements that can be either lit or not. And depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting  the digital elements  or  for that matter  the neurons in the sheet  you're going to be able to construct a map. This  of course  is a visual map that I'm showing you  but this applies to any kind of map    auditory  for example  in relation to sound frequencies  or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate. Now to bring home the point of how close it is    the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience    I'm going to tell you a personal story. So if I cover my left eye    I'm talking about me personally  not all of you    if I cover my left eye  I look at the grid    pretty much like the one I'm showing you. Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular. But sometime ago  I discovered that if I cover my left eye  instead what I get is this. I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central left field. Very odd    I've analyzed this for a while. But sometime ago  through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine  Carmen Puliafito  who developed a laser scanner of the retina  I found out the the following. If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner  what I get is the following. On the right side  my retina is perfectly symmetrical. You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. But on my left retina there is a bump  which is marked there by the red arrow. And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image. So just think of this  you have a grid of neurons  and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid  and you get a warping of your mental experience. So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina  which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball  or  for that matter  a sheet of visual cortex. So from the retina you go onto visual cortex. And of course  the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina. And in that image there  you see a variety of islands of what I call image making regions in the brain. You have the green for example  that corresponds to tactile information  or the blue that corresponds to auditory information. And something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps  can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around  which is the association cortex  where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making. And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory  out of those association cortices  and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception. So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is. So it provides certain areas for perception and image making. And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information. So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images. But what about the self  The self is really the elusive problem. And for a long time  people did not even want to touch it  because they'd say   How can you have this reference point  this stability  that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day   And I thought about a solution to this problem. It's the following. We generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps. So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this. I came to this because  if you're going to have a reference that we know as self    the Me  the I in our own processing    we need to have something that is stable  something that does not deviate much from day to day. Well it so happens that we have a singular body. We have one body  not two  not three. And so that is a beginning. There is just one reference point  which is the body. But then  of course  the body has many parts  and things grow at different rates  and they have different sizes and different people  however  not so with the interior. The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu    for example  the whole management of the chemistries within our body are  in fact  extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason. If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life permitting survival range  you go into disease or death. So we have an in built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity. I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day. Because if you don't have that sameness  physiologically  you're going to be sick or you're going to die. So that's one more element for this continuity. And the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself  unlike any other coupling. So for example  I'm making images of you  but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain. However  there is a close  permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body. So here's how it looks. Look at the region there. There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life regulation devices of the body. This is so specific that  for example  if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem  if you damage that as a result of a stroke  for example  what you get is coma or vegetative state  which is a state  of course  in which your mind disappears  your consciousness disappears. What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self  you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence  and  in fact  there can be images going on  being formed in the cerebral cortex  except you don't know they're there. You have  in effect  lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. But if you consider the green part of the brain stem  nothing like that happens. It is that specific. So in that green component of the brain stem  if you damage it  and often it happens  what you get is complete paralysis  but your conscious mind is maintained. You feel  you know  you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly. This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it. And people are  in fact  imprisoned within their own bodies  but they do have a mind. There was a very interesting film  one of the rare good films done about a situation like this  by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition. So now I'm going to show you a picture. I promise not to say anything about this  except this is to frighten you. It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem  there are  to make it simple  all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior  different aspects of our body. They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern. And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe    and I could be wrong  but I don't think I am    that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings    primordial feelings  by the way. So what is the picture that we get here  Look at  cerebral cortex   look at  brain stem   look at  body   and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body. And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are  in fact  the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to  as we should  because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds. But look at the arrows. They're not there for looks. They're there because there's this very close interaction. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body. Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. So throughout vertebrates  the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours  which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do. Except that they're not as rich as ours  because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do. That's where the difference is. And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex. Only the wealth of our minds is  not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence  and that we have any sense of person. Now there are three levels of self to consider    the proto  the core and the autobiographical. The first two are shared with many  many other species  and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species. It's the autobiographical self which some species have  I think. Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree. And everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree. But the novelty is here. The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made  it's the lived past and the anticipated future. And the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory  reasoning  imagination  creativity and language. And out of that came the instruments of culture    religions  justice  trade  the arts  science  technology. And it is within that culture that we really can get    and this is the novelty    something that is not entirely set by our biology. It is developed in the cultures. It developed in collectives of human beings. And this is  of course  the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio cultural regulation. And finally  you could rightly ask  why care about this  Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made  Three reasons. First  curiosity. Primates are extremely curious    and humans most of all. And if we are interested  for example  in the fact that anti gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth  why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings  Second  understanding society and culture. We should look at how society and culture in this socio cultural regulation are a work in progress. And finally  medicine. Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression  Alzheimer's disease  drug addiction. Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. You have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non serendipitous way if you do not know how this works. So that's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing  and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains. Thank you for your attention. I study how the brain processes information. That is  how it takes information in from the outside world  and converts it into patterns of electrical activity  and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things    to see  hear  to reach for an object. So I'm really a basic scientist  not a clinician  but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over  to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices  and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this. It's really our first foray into this. It's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness. So let me start in on that problem. There are    million people in the U.S. and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina  diseases like macular degeneration  and there's little that can be done for them. There are some drug treatments  but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population. And so  for the vast majority of patients  their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices. The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well. They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide. And so  you know  for example  with these devices  patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges  not very much more  so nothing close to normal vision has been possible. So what I'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference  to be much more effective  and what I wanted to do is show you how it works. Okay  so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve. Here you have a retina. So you have an image  a retina  and a brain. So when you look at something  like this image of this baby's face  it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina  on the front end cells here  the photoreceptors. Then what happens is the retinal circuitry  the middle part  goes to work on it  and what it does is it performs operations on it  it extracts information from it  and it converts that information into a code. And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain  and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code. And when I say code  I do literally mean code. Like this pattern of pulses here actually means  baby's face   and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses  it knows that what was out there was a baby's face  and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was  say  a dog  or another pattern would be a house. Anyway  you get the idea. And  of course  in real life  it's all dynamic  meaning that it's changing all the time  so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too. So  you know  it's sort of a complicated thing. You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing. So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration  What happens is is that  the front end cells die  the photoreceptors die  and over time  all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them  they die too. Until the only things that you have left are these cells here  the output cells  the ones that send the signals to the brain  but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore. They aren't getting any input  so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information    that is  he or she is blind. So  a solution to the problem  then  would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells  and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain. So this is what we've been working on  and this is what our prosthetic does. So it consists of two parts  what we call an encoder and a transducer. And so the encoder does just what I was saying  it mimics the actions of the front end circuitry    so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code. And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain  and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output. So a completely blind retina  even one with no front end circuitry at all  no photoreceptors  can now send out normal signals  signals that the brain can understand. So no other device has been able to do this. Okay  so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing  because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool. I'm not sure  cool  is really the right word  but you know what I mean. So what it's doing is  it's replacing the retinal circuitry  really the guts of the retinal circuitry  with a set of equations  a set of equations that we can implement on a chip. So it's just math. In other words  we're not literally replacing the components of the retina. It's not like we're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types. We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations. And so  in a way  the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in  goes through the set of equations  and out comes streams of electrical pulses  just like a normal retina would produce. Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output  and what the implications of this are. Here are three sets of firing patterns. The top one is from a normal animal  the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder transducer device  and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic. So the bottom one is the state of the art device that's out there right now  which is basically made up of light detectors  but no encoder. So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things    people  babies  park benches  you know  regular things happening    and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals. Now just to orient you  each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells  and just as in the previous slides  each row is a different cell  and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data. So as you can see  the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns    and it's not perfect  but it's pretty good    and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic  the responses really don't. And so with the standard method  the cells do fire  they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code. How important is this  What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see  So I'm just going to show you one bottom line experiment that answers this  and of course I've got a lot of other data  so if you're interested I'm happy to show more. So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment. So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked  what was the retina seeing at that moment  Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns  So  when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer. So let me show you  and I'm going to start with the standard method first. So you can see that it's pretty limited  and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code  they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there  but it's not so clear what that something is  and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning  that with the standard method  patients can see high contrast edges  they can see light  but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image  It was a baby's face. So what about with our approach  adding the code  And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face  but you can tell that it's this baby's face  which is a really challenging task. So on the left is the encoder alone  and on the right is from an actual blind retina  so the encoder and the transducer. But the key one really is the encoder alone  because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer. This is just actually the first one that we tried. I just wanted to say something about the standard method. When this first came out  it was just a really exciting thing  the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all. But there was this limiting factor  the issue of the code  and how to make the cells respond better  produce normal responses  and so this was our contribution. Now I just want to wrap up  and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested  but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language  and the potential power of being able to do that. So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood  and be understood by the brain. And then the last thing I wanted to say  really  is to emphasize that the idea generalizes. So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas  for example  the auditory system and the motor system  so for treating deafness and for motor disorders. So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells  we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve  or jump over damaged areas in the cortex  in the motor cortex  to bridge the gap produced by a stroke. I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really  really important  and if we can understand the code  the language of the brain  things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before. Thank you. Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school  There was this hero  Odysseus  who's heading back home after the Trojan War. And he's standing on the deck of his ship  he's talking to his first mate  and he's saying   Tomorrow  we will sail past those rocks  and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens. And these women sing an enchanting song  a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die.  Now you would expect  given that  that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens  but instead Odysseus says   I want to hear that song. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men    stay with me    so that you can't hear the song  and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected.  So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song. And I'd like to think if this was the case  they probably would have rehearsed it a few times. Odysseus would have said   Okay  let's do a dry run. You tie me to the mast  and I'm going to beg and plead. And no matter what I say  you cannot untie me from the mast. All right  so tie me to the mast.  And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot. And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says   Untie me. Untie me. I want to hear that song. Untie me.  And the first mate wisely resists and doesn't untie Odysseus. And then Odysseus says   I see that you can get it. All right  untie me now and we'll get some dinner.  And the first mate hesitates. He's like   Is this still the rehearsal  or should I untie him   And the first mate thinks   Well  I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end.  So he unties Odysseus  and Odysseus flips out. He's like   You idiot. You moron. If you do that tomorrow  I'll be dead  you'll be dead  every single one of the men will be dead. Now just don't untie me no matter what.  He throws the first mate to the ground. This repeats itself through the night    rehearsal  tying to the mast  conning his way out of it  beating the poor first mate up mercilessly. Hilarity ensues. Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head. Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it. Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation. There is first  the present self. This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song. He just wants to get to the front row. He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification. But then there's this other self  the future self. This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca    the other one. So why do we need commitment devices  Well resisting temptation is hard  as the   th century English economist Nassau William Senior said   To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power  or to seek distant rather than immediate results  are among the most painful exertions of the human will.  If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people  you probably realize it's not that your goals are physically impossible that's keeping you from achieving them  it's that you lack the self discipline to stick to them. It's physically possible to lose weight. It's physically possible to exercise more. But resisting temptation is hard. The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. I mean  let's face it  the present self is present. It's in control. It's in power right now. It has these strong  heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. And the future self is not even around. It's off in the future. It's weak. It doesn't even have a lawyer present. There's nobody to stick up for the future self. And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams. So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought  and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two. Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually. Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one  but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer. I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were. So when I was a starving post doc at Columbia University  I was deep in a publish or perish phase of my career. I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars. And when you try to execute these commitment devices  you realize the devil is really in the details. Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars. I mean  you can't burn it  that's illegal. And I thought  well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that. But then I thought  oh  I'm sending myself mixed messages. Because not writing is bad  but giving to charity is good. So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift. And then I kind of flipped that around and thought  well I could give it to the neo Nazis. But then I was like  that's more bad than writing is good  and so that wouldn't work. So ultimately  I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway. Sometimes a good person would find it  sometimes a bad person would find it. On average  it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret. Such it is with commitment devices. But despite my like for them  there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices  and you might feel this if you use them yourself. So the first is  when you've got one of these devices going  such as this contract to write everyday or pay  it's just a constant reminder that you have no self control. You're just telling yourself   Without you  commitment device  I am nothing  I have no self discipline.  And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place    like   Oh my God  that person's offering me a doughnut  and I have no defense mechanism      you just eat it. So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you. I think self discipline is something  it's like a muscle. The more you exercise it  the stronger it gets. The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them. You say   Well  of course I can't write today  because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews  and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that. And so there's no way that this is going to work.  So in effect  you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person. You're putting yourself  you're binding yourself  and you're weaseling your way out of it  and then you're beating yourself up afterwards. So I've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices. In particular  I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self. And this is a timely issue. I'm talking about the topic of saving. Now saving is a classic two selves problem. The present self does not want to save at all. It wants to consume. Whereas the future self wants the present self to save. So this is a timely problem. We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the     s. At the same time  the Retirement Risk Index  the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement  has been increasing. And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers  the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre retirement needs while they're in retirement. So what can we do about this  There's a philosopher  Derek Parfit  who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I. He said that   We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination.  That is to say  we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old  or we might not be able to imagine that we're going to get old some day. On the one hand  it sounds ridiculous. Of course  we know that we're going to get old. But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time  So my coauthors and I have used computers  the greatest tool of our time  to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. And I'll show you some of these tools right here. The first is called the distribution builder. It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. Each outcome is shown by one of these markers  and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement. Being up at the top means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement. Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet. When you make an investment  what you're really saying is   I accept that any one of these     things could happen to me and determine my wealth.  Now you can try to move your outcomes around. You can try to manipulate your fate  like this person is doing  but it costs you something to do it. It means that you have to save more today. Once you find an investment that you're happy with  what people do is they click  done  and the markers begin to disappear  slowly  one by one. It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out. At the end  there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement. Yes  this person retired at     percent of their working income in retirement. They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working. If you're like most people  just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy    just to think about making    percent more money in retirement than before. However  had you ended up on the very bottom  it might have given you a slight sense of dread and or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement. By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome  people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well being in the future. Now people are motivated through emotions  but different people find different things motivating. This is a simulation that uses graphics  but other people find motivating what money can buy  not just numbers. So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes  I show people what those outcomes will get you  in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on                     dollars per month and so on. As you move down the ladder of apartments  you see that they get worse and worse. Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student. And as you get to the very bottom  you're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don't save anything for retirement  you won't be able to afford any housing at all. Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet. The last thing I'll show you  the last behavioral time machine  is something that I created with Hal Hershfield  who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project  Bill Sharpe. And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality. So what we do is we take pictures of people    in this case  college age people    and we use software to age them and show these people what they'll look like when they're            years old. And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior. So this is one of our experiments. Here we see the face of the young subject on the left. He's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate. As he moves his savings rate down  it means that he's saving zero when it's all the way here at the left. You can see his current annual income    this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today    is quite high     percent  but his retirement income is quite low. He's going to retire on    percent of what he earned while he was working. If he saves the maximum legal amount  his retirement income goes up  but he's unhappy because now he has less money on the left hand side to spend today. Other conditions show people the future self. And from the future self's point of view  everything is in reverse. If you save very little  the future self is unhappy living on    percent of the income. Whereas if the present self saves a lot  the future self is delighted  where the income is close up near     percent. To bring this to a wider audience  I've been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine  in which you not only get to see yourself in the future  but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth. So for instance  here is somebody using the tool. And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider. The younger face gets happier and happier  saving nothing. The older face is miserable. And slowly  slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate. And then it's a high savings rate. The younger face is getting unhappy. The older face is quite pleased with the decision. We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do. And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually  because as one face smiles  the other face frowns. It's not telling you which way to put the slider  it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self. Your decisions today are going to determine its well being. And that's something that's easy to forget. This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older. There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke  if they get too much exposure to the sun  if they gain weight and so on. And what's good is  unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith  you don't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality. There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing. This is actually a picture of Hal  my coauthor. You might recognize him from the previous demos. And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding  aging and weight gain software to see how he would look. Hal is here  so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. And I'll close it there. On behalf of Hal and myself  I wish all the best to your present and future selves. Thank you. In       I walked into a prison in Cambodia  and I met a    year old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel. And as I looked into his eyes  I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners  that I would never have written a letter for him  because he was not a    year old boy who had done something important for anybody. He was not a political prisoner. He was a    year old boy who had stolen a bicycle. What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia  but of the     developing countries that torture     of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured. And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool. We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst  but  in fact     percent of torture today is not for political prisoners. It is for people who are in broken down legal systems  and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation    it's cheaper than having a legal system  cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel    it is what happens most of the time. I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community  if we make a decision  to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime  but it will require three things. First is the training  empowerment  and connection of defenders worldwide. The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel. And the third is commitment. So in the year       I began to wonder  what if we came together  Could we do something for these    countries  And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the    countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms. My first experiences  though  did come from Cambodia  and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were  in       still less than    attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all. And even    years later  there was only    lawyers in the country  so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet    year old boys  you'd meet women and you'd say   Why are you here   Women would say   Well I've been here for    years because my husband committed a crime  but they can't find him.  So it's just a place where there was no rule of law. The first group of defenders came together and I still remember  as I was training  I said   Okay  what do you do for an investigation   And there was silence in the class  and finally one woman stood up   inaudible name   and she said  Khrew   which means  teacher.  She said   I have defended more than a hundred people  and I've never had to do any investigation  because they all come with confessions.  And we talked about  as a class  the fact that number one  the confessions might not be reliable  but number two  we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this  especially as it was now against the law. And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws. And I still remember the first cases where they came  all    together  she would stand up  and they were in the back  and they would support her  and the judges kept saying   No  no  no  no  we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them.  But one day the perfect case came  and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller  she was sitting outside of a house. She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was  but the police came  they got her  there was nothing on her. She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried. And when they brought her case to the judge  for the first time he stood up and he said   Yes  there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released.  And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see  they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia. But Cambodia is not alone. I used to think  well is it Cambodia  Or is it other countries  But it is in so many countries. In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a    year old boy  it was an   year old boy for stealing a mobile phone. Or a woman  I picked up her baby  really cute baby  I said  Your baby is so cute.  It wasn't a baby  she was three. And she said  Yeah  but she's why I'm here   because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison. And when I walked up to the prison director  I said   You've got to let her out. A judge would let her out.  And he said   Okay  we can talk about it  but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do   So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases. But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers  but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference. For example  in Cambodia  it was that  inaudible name  did not go alone but she had    lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way  in China  they always tell me   It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together.  Or in Zimbabwe  where I remember Innocent  after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said   I've been here for one year  eight years     years without a lawyer   he came and we had a training together and he said   I have heard it said     because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling     I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources.  And then he said   But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice.  And with that  he successfully organized    lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases. The key that we see  though  is training and then early access. I was recently in Egypt  and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers  and what they told me is that they said   Hey  look  we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time.  And I said   But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here. What's going on   I met with one of the development agencies  and they were training prosecutors and judges  which is the normal bias  as opposed to defenders. And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual. I said   I'm gonna copy this.  It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect. Prosecutors were perfectly trained. But I said to them   I just have one question  which is  by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office  what had happened to them   And after a pause  they said   They had been tortured.  So the pieces are  not only the training of the lawyers  but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel  because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured. And as I tell you this  I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like   Oh  okay  it sounds like we could do it  but can we really do it   Because it sounds big. And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible. The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment. It's not only Innocent  who I told you about in Zimbabwe  but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces. We have a program called JusticeMakers  and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things  but how can we support them  So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice. And there are    JusticeMakers throughout the world  from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC  who with five thousand dollars do amazing things  through SMS programs  through paralegal programs  through whatever they can do. And it's not only these JusticeMakers  but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward. So in China  for instance  great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished. And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers  and said   How can we get this out  How can we make sure that this is implemented  This is fantastic.  And he said to me   Well  do you have money   And I said   No.  And he said   That's okay  we can still figure it out.  And on December    he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League  from    of the top law schools  who organized themselves  developed posters with the new laws  and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights. So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders. We need to systematically implement early access to counsel. But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this. And people often say to me   You know  this is great  but it's wildly idealistic. Never going to happen.  And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery  or end apartheid. It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit. Now  there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders  which they share from each other  is   Take courage friends  the road is often long  the path is never clear  and the stakes are very high  but deep down  you are not alone.  And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders  but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it  we can end torture as an investigative tool. I end always  because I'm sure the questions are    and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point     But what can I really do   Well  I would say this. First of all  you know what you can do. But second of all  I would leave you with the story of Vishna  who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice. Vishna was a   year old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison  everybody loved him  including the guards  so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars. So  you know  there's bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger  which means what gets bigger  Your head gets bigger. So he would come to the first bar  the second bar and then the third bar  and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through  and come back  third  second  first. And he would grab my pinkie  because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit. You know  he never quite made it to all of them every day  but he wanted to visit all     prisoners. And I would lift him  and he would put his fingers through. Or if they were dark cells  it was like iron corrugated  and he would put his fingers through. And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine  and they looked forward to him. And I was like  here's Vishna. He's a   year old boy. He was born in a prison with almost nothing  no material goods  but he had a sense of his own heroic journey  which I believe we are all born into. He said   Probably I can't do everything. But I'm one. I can do something. And I will do the one thing that I can do.  So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together  and invite you into this journey with us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I've been in Afghanistan for    years. I work for the Red Cross and I'm a physical therapist. My job is to make arms and legs    well it's not completely true. We do more than that. We provide the patients  the Afghan disabled  first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration. It's a very logical plan  but it was not always like this. For many years  we were just providing them with artificial limbs. It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now. Today  I would like to tell you a story  the story of a big change  and the story of the people who made this change possible. I arrived in Afghanistan in      to work in a hospital for war victims. And then  not only for war victims  but it was for any kind of patient. I was also working in the orthopedic center  we call it. This is the place where we make the legs. At that time I found myself in a strange situation. I felt not quite ready for that job. There was so much to learn. There were so many things new to me. But it was a terrific job. But as soon as the fighting intensified  the physical rehabilitation was suspended. There were many other things to do. So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. It was a strange sensation. Anyway  you know every time I make this speech    it's not the first time    but it's an emotion. It's something that comes out from the past. It's    years  but they are still all there. Anyway  in       the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan. And the orthopedic center was closed. I was assigned to work for the homeless  for the internally displaced people. But one day  something happened. I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions. I wanted to go home. I was driving. You know  when you want to forget  you don't want to see things  so you just want to go to your room  to lock yourself inside and say   That's enough.  A bomb fell not far from my car    well  far enough  but big noise. And everybody disappeared from the street. The cars disappeared as well. I ducked. And only one figure remained in the middle of the road. It was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to move away. Well I'm not a particularly brave person  I have to confess it  but I could not just ignore him. So I stopped the car and I went to help. The man was without legs and only with one arm. Behind him there was a child  his son  red in the face in an effort to push the father. So I took him into a safe place. And I ask   What are you doing out in the street in this situation    I work   he said. I wondered  what work  And then I ask an even more stupid question   Why don't you have the prostheses  Why don't you have the artificial legs   And he said   The Red Cross has closed.  Well without thinking  I told him  Come tomorrow. We will provide you with a pair of legs.  The man  his name was Mahmoud  and the child  whose name was Rafi  left. And then I said   Oh  my God. What did I say  The center is closed  no staff around. Maybe the machinery is broken. Who is going to make the legs for him   So I hoped that he would not come. This is the streets of Kabul in those days. So I said   Well I will give him some money.  And so the following day  I went to the orthopedic center. And I spoke with a gatekeeper. I was ready to tell him   Listen  if someone such and such comes tomorrow  please tell him that it was a mistake. Nothing can be done. Give him some money.  But Mahmoud and his son were already there. And they were not alone. There were     maybe     people like him waiting. And there was some staff too. Among them there was my right hand man  Najmuddin. And the gatekeeper told me   They come everyday to see if the center will open.  I said   No. We have to go away. We cannot stay here.  They were bombing    not very close    but you could hear the noise of the bombs. So   We cannot stay here  it's dangerous. It's not a priority.  But Najmuddin told me   Listen now  we're here.  At least we can start repairing the prostheses  the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like Mahmoud.  I said   No  please. We cannot do that. It's really dangerous. We have other things to do.  But they insisted. When you have    people in front of you  looking at you and you are the one who has to decide ... So we started doing some repairs. Also one of the physical therapists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg  but not immediately. The legs were swollen and the knees were stiff  so he needed a long preparation. Believe me  I was worried because I was breaking the rules. I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. In the evening  I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters  and I told them    I lied    I told them   Listen  we are going to start a couple of hours per day  just a few repairs.  Maybe some of them are here now. So we started. I was working  I was going everyday to work for the homeless. And Najmuddin was staying there  doing everything and reporting on the patients. He was telling me   Patients are coming.  We knew that many more patients could not come  prevented by the fighting. But people were coming. And Mahmoud was coming every day. And slowly  slowly week after week his legs were improving. The stump or cast prosthesis was made  and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation. He was coming every day  crossing the front line. A couple of times I crossed the front line in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing. I tell you  it was something so sinister that I was astonished he could do it every day. But finally  the great day arrived. Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs. It was April  I remember  a very beautiful day. April in Kabul is beautiful  full of roses  full of flowers. We could not possibly stay indoors  with all these sandbags at the windows. Very sad  dark. So we chose a small spot in the garden. And Mahmoud put on his prostheses  the other patients did the same  and they started practicing for the last time before being discharged. Suddenly  they started fighting. Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting. We could hear in the air the bullets passing. So we dashed  all of us  towards the shelter. Mahmoud grabbed his son  I grabbed someone else. Everybody was grabbing something. And we ran. You know     meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed  but we managed to reach the shelter. Inside  all of us panting  I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father   Father  you can run faster than me.  And Mahmoud   Of course I can. I can run  and now you can go to school. No need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair.  Later on  we took them home. And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair. And then I understood  physical rehabilitation is a priority. Dignity cannot wait for better times. From that day on  we never closed a single day. Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours  but we never  we never closed it again. I met Mahmoud one year later. He was in good shape    a bit thinner. He needed to change his prostheses    a new pair of prostheses. I asked about his son. He told me   He's at school. He'd doing quite well.  But I understood he wanted to tell me something. So I asked him   What is that   He was sweating. He was clearly embarrassed. And he was standing in front of me  his head down. He said   You have taught me to walk. Thank you very much. Now help me not to be a beggar anymore.  That was the job.  My children are growing. I feel ashamed. I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students.  I said   Okay.  I thought  how much money do I have in my pocket  Just to give him some money. It was the easiest way. He read my mind  and he said   I ask for a job.  And then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life. He said   I am a scrap of a man  but if you help me  I'm ready to do anything  even if I have to crawl on the ground.  And then he sat down. I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere. Legless  with only one arm  illiterate  unskilled    what job for him  Najmuddin told me   Well we have a vacancy in the carpentry shop.   What   I said   Stop.   Well yes  we need to increase the production of feet. We need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet. We need to increase the production.   Excuse me   I could not believe. And then he said   No  we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool  a special anvil  special vice  and maybe an electric screwdriver.  I said   Listen  it's insane. And it's even cruel to think of anything like this. That's a production line and a very fast one. It's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he's going to fail.  But with Najmuddin  we cannot discuss. So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise. Only one week    one week try and not a single day more. One week later  Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line. I told Najmuddin   That's a trick. I can't believe it.  The production was up    percent.  It's a trick  it's a trick   I said. And then I asked for verification. It was true. The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove. I understood that I was wrong again. Mahmoud had looked taller. I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling. He was a new man  taller again. Of course  I understood that what made him stand tall    yeah they were the legs  thank you very much    but as a first step  it was the dignity. He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job. So of course  I understood. And then we started a new policy    a new policy completely different. We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job. It became a policy of  positive discrimination   we call it now. And you know what  It's good for everybody. Everybody benefits from that    those employed  of course  because they get a job and dignity. But also for the newcomers. They are       every year    people coming for the first time. And you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them. Sometimes you see them  they look   Oh.  And you see the faces. And then the surprise turns into hope. And it's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability. Poof  they learn much faster    the motivation  the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different  completely. Scraps of men do not exist. People like Mahmoud are agents of change. And when you start changing  you cannot stop. So employing people  yes  but also we started programming projects of microfinance  education. And when you start  you cannot stop. So you do vocational training  home education for those who cannot go to school. Physical therapies can be done  not only in the orthopedic center  but also in the houses of the people. There is always a better way to do things. That's Najmuddin  the one with the white coat. Terrible Najmuddin  is that one. I have learned a lot from people like Najmuddin  Mahmoud  Rafi. They are my teachers. I have a wish  a big wish  that this way of working  this way of thinking  is going to be implemented in other countries. There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan. It is possible and it is not difficult. All we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist  to make them part of the decision making process and then  of course  to adapt. This is my big wish. Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over  not at all. We are going on. Recently we have just started a program  a sport program    basketball for wheelchair users. We transport the wheelchairs everywhere. We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan. At the beginning  when Anajulina told me   We would like to start it   I hesitated. I said   No   you can imagine. I said   No  no  no  no  we can't.  And then I asked the usual question   Is it a priority  Is it really necessary   Well now you should see me. I never miss a single training session. The night before a match I'm very nervous. And you should see me during the match. I shout like a true Italian. What's next  What is going to be the next change  Well I don't know yet  but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends  they have it already in mind. That was my story. Thank you very much. I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation  hopefully for a good cause  which is self improvement. And I've done this in three parts. So first I started with the mind. And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z    or  more precisely  from  a ak  to  Zywiec.  And here's a little image of that. And this was an amazing year. It was really a fascinating journey. It was painful at times  especially for those around me. My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. So it had its downsides. But after that  I decided to work on the spirit. As I mentioned last year  I grew up with no religion at all. I'm Jewish  but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. Not really. But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard    because Leviticus says you cannot shave. So this is what I looked like by the end. Thank you for that reaction. I look a little like Moses  or Ted Kaczynski. I got both of them. So there was the topiary there. And there's the sheep. Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be  the healthiest person alive. So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. And I just finished a couple of months ago. And I have to say  thank God. Because living so healthily was killing me. It was so overwhelming  because the amount of things you have to do  it's just mind boggling. I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. And they were telling me all the things I had to do. I had to eat right  exercise  meditate  pet dogs  because that lowers the blood pressure. I wrote the book on a treadmill  and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. I had to put on sunscreen. This was no small feat  because if you listen to dermatologists  they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. There was the washing of hands. I had to do that properly. And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house  because those are just orgies of germs. So that took a lot of time. I also tried to be the safest person I could be  because that's a part of health. I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. They started a public campaign that says   A walking helmet is a good helmet.  So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking  but also for walking around. And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. Well yeah  I tried that. Now it's a little extreme  I admit. But if you think about this  this is actually    the  Freakonomics  authors wrote about this    that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. So I finished  and it was a success in a sense. All of the markers went in the right direction. My cholesterol went down  I lost weight  my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. So that was nice. And it was successful overall. But I also learned that I was too healthy  and that was unhealthy. I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. And as Dan Buettner can tell you  having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. So I finished. And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. I went to the dark side  and I just indulged myself. It was like something out of Caligula. Without the sex part. Because I have three young kids  so that wasn't happening. But the over eating and over drinking  definitely. And I finally have stabilized. So now I'm back to adopting many    not all  I don't wear a helmet anymore    but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. It was really a life changing project. And I  of course  don't have time to go into all of them. Let me just tell you two really quickly. The first is    and this was surprising to me  I didn't expect this to come out    but I live a much quieter life now. Because we live in such a noisy world. There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly  he's very noisy. And this is a real underestimated  under appreciated health hazard    not just because it harms our hearing  which it obviously does  but it actually initiates the fight or flight response. A loud noise will get your fight or flight response going. And this  over the years  can cause real damage  cardiovascular damage. The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. And it was done in Europe. And they estimated that  .  million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. So they think it's actually very deadly. And by the way  it's also terrible for your brain. It really impairs cognition. And our Founding Fathers knew about this. When they wrote the Constitution  they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. So without noise reduction technology  our country would not exist. So as a patriot  I felt it was important to    I wear all the earplugs and the earphones  and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. And the second point I want to make  the final point  is that    and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED    that joy is so important to your health  that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. And just to give you one instance of this  food. The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. To give just one example  we love crunchiness  mouthfeel. So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes    throw in some sunflower seeds. And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. And it has made me a healthier person. So that is it. The book about it comes out in April. It's called  Drop Dead Healthy.  And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. That's my greatest hope. So thank you very much. There have been many revolutions over the last century  but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution. We are living on average today    years longer than our great grandparents did. Think about that. That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan. And yet  for the most part  our culture has not come to terms with what this means. We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the metaphor  the old metaphor. You're born  you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. Age as pathology. But many people today    philosophers  artists  doctors  scientists    are taking a new look at what I call the third act  the last three decades of life. They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance    as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood. And they are asking    we should all be asking    how do we use this time  How do we live it successfully  What is the appropriate new metaphor for aging  I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject. And I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase    the upward ascension of the human spirit  bringing us into wisdom  wholeness and authenticity. Age not at all as pathology  age as potential. And guess what  This potential is not for the lucky few. It turns out  most people over    feel better  are less stressed  are less hostile  less anxious. We tend to see commonalities more than differences. Some of the studies even say we're happier. This is not what I expected  trust me. I come from a long line of depressives. As I was approaching my late   s  when I would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative. And I got scared. I thought  oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady. But now that I am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act  I realize I've never been happier. I have such a powerful feeling of well being. And I've discovered that when you're inside oldness  as opposed to looking at it from the outside  fear subsides. You realize  you're still yourself    maybe even more so. Picasso once said   It takes a long time to become young.  I don't want to romanticize aging. Obviously  there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth. Some of it is a matter of luck. Some of it  obviously  is genetic. One third of it  in fact  is genetic. And there isn't much we can do about that. But that means that two thirds of how well we do in the third act  we can do something about. We're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference. Now let me say something about the staircase  which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs. Myself included. As you may know  the entire world operates on a universal law  entropy  the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy means that everything in the world  everything  is in a state of decline and decay  the arch. There's only one exception to this universal law  and that is the human spirit  which can continue to evolve upwards    the staircase    bringing us into wholeness  authenticity and wisdom. And here's an example of what I mean. This upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges. About three years ago  I read an article in the New York Times. It was about a man named Neil Selinger       years old  a retired lawyer    who had joined the writers group at Sarah Lawrence where he found his writer's voice. Two years later  he was diagnosed with ALS  commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a terrible disease. It's fatal. It wastes the body  but the mind remains intact. In this article  Mr. Selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him. And I quote   As my muscles weakened  my writing became stronger. As I slowly lost my speech  I gained my voice. As I diminished  I grew. As I lost so much  I finally started to find myself.  Neil Selinger  to me  is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act. Now we're all born with spirit  all of us  but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life  violence  abuse  neglect. Perhaps our parents suffered from depression. Perhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world. Perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain  a wound. Perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure. And so we can feel unfinished. Perhaps the task of the third act is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves. For me  it began as I was approaching my third act  my   th birthday. How was I supposed to live it  What was I supposed to accomplish in this final act  And I realized that  in order to know where I was going  I had to know where I'd been. And so I went back and I studied my first two acts  trying to see who I was then  who I really was    not who my parents or other people told me I was  or treated me like I was. But who was I  Who were my parents    not as parents  but as people  Who were my grandparents  How did they treat my parents  These kinds of things. I discovered a couple of years later that this process that I had gone through is called by psychologists  doing a life review.  And they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person's life. You may discover  as I did  that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault  a lot of things you used to think about yourself  really had nothing to do with you. It wasn't your fault  you're just fine. And you're able to go back and forgive them and forgive yourself. You're able to free yourself from your past. You can work to change your relationship to your past. Now while I was writing about this  I came upon a book called  Man's Search for Meaning  by Viktor Frankl. Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist who'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp. And he wrote that  while he was in the camp  he could tell  should they ever be released  which of the people would be okay and which would not. And he wrote this   Everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing  your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. This is what determines the quality of the life we've lived    not whether we've been rich or poor  famous or unknown  healthy or suffering. What determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities  what kind of meaning we assign them  what kind of attitude we cling to about them  what state of mind we allow them to trigger.  Perhaps the central purpose of the third act is to go back and to try  if appropriate  to change our relationship to the past. It turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this  it manifests neurologically    neural pathways are created in the brain. You see  if you have  over time  reacted negatively to past events and people  neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain. And over time  these neural pathways become hardwired  they become the norm    even if it's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety. If however  we can go back and alter our relationship  re vision our relationship to past people and events  neural pathways can change. And if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past  that becomes the new norm. It's like resetting a thermostat. It's not having experiences that make us wise  it's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise    and that helps us become whole  brings wisdom and authenticity. It helps us become what we might have been. Women start off whole  don't we  I mean  as girls  we start off feisty     Yeah  who says   We have agency. We are the subjects of our own lives. But very often  many  if not most of us  when we hit puberty  we start worrying about fitting in and being popular. And we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives. But now  in our third acts  it may be possible for us to circle back to where we started and know it for the first time. And if we can do that  it will not just be for ourselves. Older women are the largest demographic in the world. If we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole  this will create a cultural shift in the world  and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan. Thank you very much. There's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the   th century. It was said to echo in Churchill's brain in the     s. And the poem goes   On the idle hill of summer  lazy with the flow of streams  hark I hear a distant drummer  drumming like a sound in dreams  far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by  dear to friend and food to powder  soldiers marching  soon to die.  Those who are interested in poetry  the poem is  A Shropshire Lad  written by A.E. Housman. But what Housman understood  and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too  was that the long  hot  silvan summers of stability of the   th century were coming to a close  and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes. And these are always periods  ladies and gentlemen  accompanied by turbulence  and all too often by blood. And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned  if you like  to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world  the new powers that exist in the world  are beginning to take form. And these are    and we see it very clearly today    nearly always highly turbulent times  highly difficult times  and all too often very bloody times. By the way  it happens about once every century. You might argue that the last time it happened    and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too    was that when power passed from the old nations  the old powers of Europe  across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America    the beginning of the American century. And of course  into the vacuum where the too old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century    the one in the first part and the one in the second part  the two great World Wars. Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars  and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them. Well  ladies and gentlemen  we live at one of those times. But for us  I want to talk about three factors today. And the first of these  the first two of these  is about a shift in power. And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to  which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now. But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world. And what is happening today is  in one sense  frightening because it's never happened before. We have seen lateral shifts of power    the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations    but we are seeing something slightly different. For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation. It's also moving vertically. What's happening today is that the power that was encased  held to accountability  held to the rule of law  within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage. The globalization of power    we talk about the globalization of markets  but actually it's the globalization of real power. And where  at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law  on the international stage it is not. The international stage and the global stage where power now resides  the power of the Internet  the power of the satellite broadcasters  the power of the money changers    this vast money go round that circulates now    times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance    the money changers  if you like  the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently  the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium sized countries. These live in a global space which is largely unregulated  not subject to the rule of law  and in which people may act free of constraint. Now that suits the powerful up to a moment. It's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint  but the lesson of history is that  sooner or later  unregulated space    space not subject to the rule of law    becomes populated  not just by the things you wanted    international trade  the Internet  etc.    but also by the things you don't want    international criminality  international terrorism. The revelation of      is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth  nevertheless  those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning. It's said that something like    percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund      actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which      destroyed. You see  our enemies also use this space    the space of mass travel  the Internet  satellite broadcasters    to be able to get around their poison  which is about destroying our systems and our ways. Sooner or later  sooner or later  the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow. And if it is therefore the case  as I believe it is  that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power  then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space. And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim  to bring governance to the global space. Now notice  I'm not talking about government. I'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution. My own view  by the way  ladies and gentlemen  is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions. If we didn't have the U.N.  we'd have to invent it. The world needs an international forum. It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action. But when it comes to governance of the global space  my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions. It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty based systems  treaty based agreements  to govern that global space. And if you look  you can see them happening  already beginning to emerge. The World Trade Organization  treaty based organization  entirely treaty based  and yet  powerful enough to hold even the most powerful  the United States  to account if necessary. Kyoto  the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty based organization. The G    we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation. And that's what the G   is  a treaty based institution. Now there's a problem there  and we'll come back to it in a minute  which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty based institutions  to fill that governance space  then what happens to the weak who are left out  And that's a big problem  and we'll return to it in just a second. So there's my first message  that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently  then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space. And watch that beginning to happen. My second point is  and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing  but power is not just shifting vertically  it's also shifting horizontally. You might argue that the story  the history of civilizations  has been civilizations gathered around seas    with the first ones around the Mediterranean  the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic. Well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power  broadly speaking  away from nations gathered around the Atlantic  seaboard  to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim. Now that begins with economic power  but that's the way it always begins. You already begin to see the development of foreign policies  the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world. I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East  something different is happening. My guess is  for what it's worth  is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next    years      but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered  it has radically changed. We are coming out of    years  most unusual years  of history in which we have had a totally mono polar world  in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington    a world bestrode by a single colossus. But that's not a usual case in history. In fact  what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history. You're beginning to see the emergence of a multi polar world. Up until now  the United States has been the dominant feature of our world. They will remain the most powerful nation  but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world. And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up    in China  of course  though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth. It's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy. But that's a subject of a different discussion. You see India  you see Brazil. You see increasingly that the world now looks actually  for us Europeans  much more like Europe in the   th century. Europe in the   th century  a great British foreign secretary  Lord Canning  used to describe it as the  European concert of powers.  There was a balance  a five sided balance. Britain always played to the balance. If Paris got together with Berlin  Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance. Now notice  in a period which is dominated by a mono polar world  you have fixed alliances    NATO  the Warsaw Pact. A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances. But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances. And that's the world we're coming into  in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed. Canning  the great British foreign secretary once said   Britain has a common interest  but no common allies.  And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out  have to reach out  beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world. Note  that when we went into Libya  it was not good enough for the West to do it alone  we had to bring others in. We had to bring  in this case  the Arab League in. My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves  and we haven't succeeded. My guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of     years    I say     years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire    of the hegemony of Western power  Western institutions and Western values. You know  up until now  if the West got its act together  it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world. But that's no longer true. Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War. The West got together    the Bretton Woods Institution  World Bank  International Monetary Fund    the problem solved. Now we have to call in others. Now we have to create the G  . Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends. Let me make a prediction for you  which is probably even more startling. I suspect we are now reaching the end of     years when Western power was enough. People say to me   The Chinese  of course  they'll never get themselves involved in peace making  multilateral peace making around the world.  Oh yes  Why not  How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret  serving under the blue flag  serving under the U.N. command in the world today       . How many Americans    . What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates  The Chinese naval contingent. Of course they are  they are a mercantilist nation. They want to keep the sea lanes open. Increasingly  we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values  but with whom  for the moment  we share common interests. It's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging. And here's the third factor  which is totally different. Today in our modern world  because of the Internet  because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here  everything is connected to everything. We are now interdependent. We are now interlocked  as nations  as individuals  in a way which has never been the case before  never been the case before. The interrelationship of nations  well it's always existed. Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations. But now we are intimately locked together. You get swine flu in Mexico  it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport    hours later. Lehman Brothers goes down  the whole lot collapses. There are fires in the steppes of Russia  food riots in Africa. We are all now deeply  deeply  deeply interconnected. And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone  not connected with others  not working with others  is no longer a viable proposition. Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself  nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory  because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them. I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain. At that time  the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only  how strong was our army  how strong was our air force  how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies. That was when the enemy was outside the walls. Now the enemy is inside the walls. Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country  I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security  I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies    as we see from cyber warfare    I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country  who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country    as we in London saw in the     bombings. It's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense. It's its capacity to lock together its institutions. And this tells you something very important. It tells you that  in fact  our governments  vertically constructed  constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution    vertical hierarchy  specialization of tasks  command structures    have got the wrong structures completely. You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time  ladies and gentlemen  is the network. It's your capacity to network that matters  both within your governments and externally. So here is Ashdown's third law. By the way  don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law because I haven't invented those yet  it always sounds better if there's a third law  doesn't it  Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age  where everything is connected to everything  the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others. The most important bit about your structure    whether you're a government  whether you're an army regiment  whether you're a business    is your docking points  your interconnectors  your capacity to network with others. You understand that in industry  governments don't. But now one final thing. If it is the case  ladies and gentlemen    and it is    that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before  then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other. Suddenly and for the very first time  collective defense  the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations  is no longer enough. It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe  I was safe  if my country was more powerful than their country  I was safe  my alliance  like NATO  was more powerful than their alliance  I was safe. It is no longer the case. The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that  increasingly  I share a destiny with my enemy. When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the     s  we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them. Collective security is not enough. Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero sum game couldn't work. They shared a destiny with their enemies. One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides  both Israel and  I think  the Palestinians  do not understand that they share a collective destiny. And so suddenly  ladies and gentlemen  what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy. I started with a poem  I'll end with one. The great poem of John Donne's.  Send not for whom the bell tolls.  The poem is called  No Man is an Island.  And it goes   Every man's death affected me  for I am involved in mankind  send not to ask for whom the bell tolls  it tolls for thee.  For John Donne  a recommendation of morality. For us  I think  part of the equation for our survival. Thank you very much. There's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the TED website. And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic    except for me. I don't agree with this. I think we have a situation here. Because if you think about it        TEDTalks  that's over       ideas worth spreading. How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas  Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos  it would actually currently take you over     hours to do so. And I did a little calculation of this. The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around        . So having seen this danger to the economy  I thought  we need to find a solution to this problem. Here's my approach to it all. If you look at the current situation  you have a thousand TEDTalks. Each of those TEDTalks has an average length of about       words. Now take this together and you end up with  .  million words of TEDTalks  which is about three Bibles worth of content. The obvious question here is  does a TEDTalk really need       words  Isn't there something shorter  I mean  if you have an idea worth spreading  surely you can put it into something shorter than       words. The only question is  how short can you get  What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TEDTalk  While I was pondering this question  I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway  who allegedly said that these six words here   For sale  baby shoes  never worn   were the best novel he had ever written. And I also encountered a project called Six Word Memoirs where people were asked  take your whole life and please sum this up into six words  such as these here   Found true love  married someone else.  Or  Living in existential vacuum  it sucks.  I actually like that one. So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words  you don't need more than six words for a TEDTalk. We could have been done by lunch here. I mean ... And if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks  you would get from  .  million words down to      . So I thought this was quite worthwhile. So I started asking all my friends  please take your favorite TEDTalk and put that into six words. So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice. For example  Dan Pink's talk on motivation  which was pretty good if you haven't seen it   Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning.  It's what he's basically talking about in those    and a half minutes. Or some even included references to the speakers  such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style  or the one of Tim Ferriss  which might be considered a bit strenuous at times. The challenge here is  if I try to systematically do this  I would probably end up with a lot of summaries  but not with many friends in the end. So I had to find a different method  preferably involving total strangers. And luckily there's a website for that called Mechanical Turk  which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself  such as  Please summarize this text for me in six words.  And I didn't allow any low cost countries to work on this  but I found out I could get a six word summary for just    cents  which I think is a pretty good price. Even then  unfortunately  it's not possible to summarize each TEDTalk individually. Because if you do the math  you have a thousand TEDTalks  the pay    cents each  you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks  because some of them will probably be  or are  really bad. So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars. So I thought of a different way by thinking  well  the talks revolve around certain themes. So what if I don't let people summarize individual TEDTalks to six words  but give them    TEDTalks at the same time and say   Please do a six word summary for that one.  I would cut my costs by    percent. So for      I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just     summaries  which would actually be quite nice. Now some of you might actually right now be thinking  It's downright crazy to have    TEDTalks summarized into just six words. But it's actually not  because there's an example by statistics professor  Hans Rosling. I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. He's got eight talks online  and those talks can basically be summed up into just four words  because that's all he's basically showing us  our intuition is really bad. He always proves us wrong. So people on the Internet  some didn't do so well. I mean  when I asked them to summarize the    TEDTalks at the same time  some took the easy route out. They just had some general comment. There were others  and I found this quite cheeky. They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. And finally also  I never understood this  some people really came up with their own version of the truth. I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this. But  oh well. In the end  however  and this is really amazing  for each of those    TEDTalk clusters that I submitted  I actually received meaningful summaries. Here are some of my favorites. For example  for all the TEDTalks around food  someone summed this up into   Food shaping body  brains and environment   which I think is pretty good. Or happiness   Striving toward happiness   moving toward unhappiness.  So here I was. I had started out with a thousand TEDTalks and I had     six word summaries for those. Actually it sounded nice in the beginning  but when you look at     summaries  it's quite a lot. It's a huge list. So I thought  I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries    and this is exactly what I did. So I took the     summaries that I had  put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those. Again  there were some misunderstandings. For example  when I had a cluster of all the beautiful talks  someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick up line. But in the end  amazingly  again  people were able to do it. For example  all the courageous TEDTalks   People dying   or  People suffering   was also one   with easy solutions around.  Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw dropping TEDTalk   Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer.  I mean that's the essence of it all. Now I had my nine groups  but  I mean  it's already quite a reduction. But of course  once you are that far  you're not really satisfied. I wanted to go all the way  all the way down the distillery  starting out with a thousand TEDTalks. I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words    which would be a   .     percent reduction in content. And I would only pay    .      so stay even below a hundred dollars for it. So I had    overall summaries done. This time I paid    cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. And unfortunately when I first received the answers    and here you'll see six of the answers    I was a bit disappointed. Because I think you'll agree  they all summarize some aspect of TED  but to me they felt a bit bland  or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. So I was almost ready to give up when one night I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here. So here it is  a crowd sourced  six word summary of a thousand TEDTalks at the value of    .     Why the worry  I'd rather wonder.  Thank you very much. Lauren Hodge  If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option  which would you choose  grilled or fried chicken  Now most people would answer grilled  and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories. However  grilled chicken poses a hidden danger. The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines    specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine  or PhIP    which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound. A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells  which can also cause them to metastasize or spread. They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group. Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines. However  no studies exist yet that show how or why. These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens. And as you can see  none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe  which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet. Now you might wonder how a    year old girl could come up with this idea. And I was led to it through a series of events. I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office    which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants. They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken  but they were sued because of California's Proposition     which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning. So I was very surprised about this. And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken  which doesn't seem very harmful. But then one night  my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner  and I noticed that the edges of the chicken  which had been marinated in lemon juice  turned white. And later in biology class  I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing  which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function. So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis  saying that  could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH  So my idea was born  and I had the project set up and a hypothesis  so what was my next step  Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school. I thought this would be easy  but I emailed about     different people within a five hour radius of where I lived  and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me. Most of the others either never responded back  said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me. So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times. However  it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab    so I could finally start my project. The first stage was completed at home  which consisted of marinating the chicken  grilling the chicken  amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab. The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab  which is where I extracted the chemicals  changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken. The final stages  when I ran the samples through a high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer  which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken. So when I went through the data  I had very surprising results  because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation. When compared with the unmarinated chicken  which is what I used as my control  I found that lemon juice worked by far the best  which decreased the carcinogens by about    percent. The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well  decreasing the carcinogens by about    percent. Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation  but it was nearly negligible. And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range  but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens. Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked. And I found that if you increase the time cooked  the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases. So the best way to marinate chicken  based on this  is to  not under cook  but definitely don't over cook and char the chicken  and marinate in either lemon juice  brown sugar or saltwater. Based on these findings  I have a question for you. Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life  Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated  you're definitely going to catch cancer and die. However  anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle. Is it worth it to you  How will you cook your chicken now  Shree Bose  Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose. I was the       year old age category winner and then the grand prize winner. And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant. And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors. Sounds ridiculous  right. But that was me years ago. And that was my first science fair project. It got a bit more complicated from there. My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra. My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects  including a remote controlled garbage can. And then came the summer after my freshman year  when my grandfather passed away due to cancer. And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss. So  armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology  I decided I wanted to do cancer research at   . Good plan. So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab. Got rejected by all except one. And then went on  my next summer  to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth  Texas. And that is where the research began. So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about  or at least don't pay that much attention to. But yet  it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. In fact  one in    women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. One in     will die from it. Chemotherapy  one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today  involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells. Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug    a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves. Sounds great  right  But here's the problem  sometimes patients become resistant to the drug  and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free  they come back. And this time  they no longer respond to the drug. It's a huge problem. In fact  it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today. So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin. And we wanted to figure this out  because if we could figure that out  then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening. So that's what we set out to do. And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase  an energy protein. So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein  and we saw this huge shift. I mean  on the slide  you can see that on our sensitive side  these cells that are responding to the drug  when we start blocking the protein  the number of dying cells    those colored dots    they're going down. But then on this side  with the same treatment  they're going up    interesting. But those are dots on a screen for you  what exactly does that mean  Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell. And in fact  it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant. And that's huge. In fact  it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug  then if we give them a chemical to block this protein  then we can treat them again with the same drug. And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness    possibly for many different types of cancer. So that was my work  and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research  with figuring out exactly what this protein does  but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness    so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren. But my work wasn't just about the research. It was about finding my passion. That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair    cute picture  right    it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor. And ever since then  I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff    from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys. But like I said  my journey wasn't just about the research  it was about finding my passion  and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing. It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing. After all  my story begins with a dried  withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there. Thank you. Naomi Shah  Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah  and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients.  .  million deaths worldwide. One death every    seconds. People spend over    percent of their lives indoors. And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined. Now these statistics had a huge impact on me  but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year round. It confused me  why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season  With this question in mind  I started researching  and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit. As soon as I realized this  I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients. At first  I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients. But soon after  I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients. And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health  because that relationship seems so important. So with that in mind  I started researching more  I started investigating more  and I became very passionate. Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation  we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively. For example  volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools  homes and workplaces. They're everywhere. These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant  as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act. Which is surprising to me  because these chemical pollutants  through my research  I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated. So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created. I'm going to show it to you on my laptop. And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today  Julie. And all of Julie's data has been pre entered into my interactive software model. And this can be used by anyone. So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes  or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder. So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma. And the doctor has her sit down  and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate    which is essentially her exhalation rate  or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath. So that peak expiratory flow rate  I've entered it up into the interactive software model. I've also entered in her age  her gender and her height. I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels. So any user can come in here and click on  lung function report  and it'll take them to this report that I created. And this report really drives home the crux of my research. So what it shows    if you want to focus on that top graph in the right hand corner    it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar. This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office. In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph  it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate  what her exhalation rate or lung health  should be based on her age  gender and height. So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar  and he says   Wow  we need to give her steroids  medication and inhalers.  But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids  inhalers and medication  the doctor turns to Julie and says   Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters. Clean out the air ducts in your home  in your workplace  in your school. Stop the use of incense and candles. And if you're remodeling your house  take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring.  Because these solutions are natural  these solutions are sustainable  and these solutions are long term investments    long term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations. Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home  her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her. So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma  more respiratory disorders  as well as more pollutants. But before I end my talk today  I want to leave you with one saying. And that saying is that genetics loads the gun  but the environment pulls the trigger. And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research. Because what I feel  is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level  that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything. But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home  in our own school and in our own workplace  we can make a huge difference in air quality. Because remember  we spend    percent of our lives indoors. And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients  anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general. So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality  better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations. Thank you. Lisa Ling  Right. Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly  Your Google Science Fair champions. Your winners. Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today    we think of financial and economic primarily    the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue    our ability to address modern conflicts as they are  to go to the source of what they're all about and to understand the key players and to deal with them. We who are diplomats  we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states. And I can tell you  our agenda is full. There is trade  there is disarmament  there is cross border relations. But the picture is changing  and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene. We loosely call them  groups.  They may represent social  religious  political  economic  military realities. And we struggle with how to deal with them. The rules of engagement  how to talk  when to talk  and how to deal with them. Let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since      until today. You see the green is a traditional interstate conflict  the ones we used to read about. The red is modern conflict  conflicts within states. These are quite different  and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy. And the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries. And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries. So in a way  it is everybody's business. Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years  recent years  is that very few of these domestic interstate  intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily. They may have to be dealt with with military means  but they cannot be solved by military means. They need political solutions. And we  therefore  have a problem  because they escape traditional diplomacy. And we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them. Plus  during the last decade  we've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous. After       either you were with us or against us. It was black or white. And groups are very often immediately label terrorists. And who would talk to terrorists  The West  as I would see it  comes out of that decade weakened  because we didn't understand the group. So we've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others. Now I'm not naive. You cannot talk to everybody all the time. And there are times you should walk. And sometimes military intervention is necessary. I happen to believe that Libya was necessary and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary. And my country relies on its security through military alliance  that's clear. But still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict. Let us turn to Afghanistan.    years after that military intervention  that country is far from secure. The situation  to be honest  is very serious. Now again  the military is necessary  but the military is no problem solver. When I first came to Afghanistan in      as a foreign minister  I met the commander of ISAF  the international troops. And he told me that   This can be won militarily  minister. We just have to persevere.  Now four COM ISAF's later  we hear a different message   This cannot be won militarily. We need military presence  but we need to move to politics. We can only solve this through a political solution. And it is not us who will solve it  Afghans have to solve it.  But then they need a different political process than the one they were given in           . They need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues. Everybody seems to agree with that. It was very controversial to say three  four  five years ago. Now everybody agrees. But now  as we prepare to talk  we understand how little we know. Because we didn't talk. We didn't grasp what was going on. The International Committee of the Red Cross  the ICRC  is talking to everyone  and it is doing so because it is neutral. And that's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict    because they talk. My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk. And you don't have to agree when you sit down with the other side. And you can always walk. But if you don't talk  you can't engage the other side. And the other side which you're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree. Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process   You don't make peace with your friends  you make peace with your enemies.  It's hard  but it is necessary. Let me go one step further. This is Tahrir Square. There's a revolution going on. The Arab Spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter. It will last for a long  long time. And who knows what it will be called in the end. That's not the point. The point is that we are probably seeing  for the first time in the history of the Arab world  a revolution bottom up    people's revolution. Social groups are taking to the streets. And we find out in the West that we know very little about what's happening. Because we never talk to the people in these countries. Most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups  because they were terrorists. So now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution  we find out how little we know. Right now  the discussion goes   Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood  Should we talk to Hamas  If we talk to them  we may legitimize them.  I think that is wrong. If you talk in the right way  you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing. And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood  as we should  that they must respect minority rights  if we don't accept majority rights  Because they may turn out to be a majority. How can we escape  having  a double standard  if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time don't want to deal with the groups that are representative  How will we ever be interlocutors  Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups. But talking can be done in different ways. We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level. Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid. Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion. There's a big array of the ways of dealing with this. So if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come  we will further radicalization  I believe. We will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel. And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy  if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states  there are some rewards on the other side. The paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this. And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising    and for one reason primarily. And the reason is what happened in South Africa  Nelson Mandela. When Mandela came out of prison after    years of captivity  if he had told his people   It's time to take up the arms  it's time to fight   he would have been followed. And I think the international community would have said   Fair enough. It's their right to fight.  Now as you know  Mandela didn't do that. In his memoirs   Long Road to Freedom   he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being  also being a human being. So he engaged a political process of dialogue  not as a strategy of the weak  but as a strategy of the strong. And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked. Now South African friends will know that was very painful. So what can we learn from all of this  Dialogue is not easy    not between individuals  not between groups  not between governments    but it is very necessary. If we're going to deal with political conflict solving of conflicts  if we're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom up  supported by technology  which is available to all  we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations. We have to connect with these profound changes. And what is dialogue really about  When I enter into dialogue  I really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view  that I would impress upon them my opinions and my values. I cannot do that unless I send the signals that I will be open to listen to the other side's signals. We need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem solving forward. We know from our personal experiences that it's easy sometimes just to walk  and sometimes you may need to fight. And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances. Sometimes you have to. But that strategy seldom takes you very far. The alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue. And I believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy  not only between states  but also within states. We are seeing some new signs. We could never have done the convention against anti personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently  by engaging with civil society. All of a sudden  NGOs were not only standing in the streets  crying their slogans  but they were taking  them  into the negotiations  partly because they represented the victims of these weapons. And they brought their knowledge. And there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom up. This is perhaps a first element of a change. In the future  I believe  we should draw examples from these different illustrations  not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society. And we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times  climate change. How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations  unless we are able to make civil society and people  not part of the problem  but part of the solution  It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations  but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization. It's crucial to understand  I believe  because of technology and because of globalization  societies from bottom up. We as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities. What is it that makes people trust each other  not only between states  but also within states  What is the legitimacy of diplomacy  of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups  The good thing is that we are not powerless. We have never had as many means of communication  means of being connected  means of reaching out  means of including. The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication. But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it. Now  I hope  in the coming years  that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem solving  among the Afghans  inside the Palestinian population  between the peoples of Palestine and Israel. And as we try to understand this broad movement across the Arab world  we are not powerless. We need to improve the necessary skills  and we need the courage to use them. In my country  I have seen how the council of Islamist groups and Christian groups came together  not as a government initiative  but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low key tension. And when tension increased  they already had that dialogue  and that was a strength to deal with different issues. Our modern Western societies are more complex than before  in this time of migration. How are we going to settle and build a bigger  We  to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication  So there are many reasons  and for all of these reasons  this is time and this is why we must talk. Thank you for your attention. What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body. Now molecules are really  really tiny. And by tiny  I mean really. They're smaller than a wavelength of light  so we have no way to directly observe them. But through science  we do have a fairly good idea of what's going on down at the molecular scale. So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules  but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules. One way around this is to draw pictures. And this idea is actually nothing new. Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process. They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes  through technology like telescopes and microscopes  and also what they're thinking about in their minds. I picked two well known examples  because they're very well known for expressing science through art. And I start with Galileo who used the world's first telescope to look at the Moon. And he transformed our understanding of the Moon. The perception in the   th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere. But what Galileo saw was a rocky  barren world  which he expressed through his watercolor painting. Another scientist with very big ideas  the superstar of biology  is Charles Darwin. And with this famous entry in his notebook  he begins in the top left hand corner with   I think   and then sketches out the first tree of life  which is his perception of how all the species  all living things on Earth  are connected through evolutionary history    the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population. Even as a scientist  I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible  with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work  until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell  who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute. And his pictures  everything's accurate and it's all to scale. And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like. So this is a transection through blood. In the top left hand corner  you've got this yellow green area. The yellow green area is the fluids of blood  which is mostly water  but it's also antibodies  sugars  hormones  that kind of thing. And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell. And those red molecules are hemoglobin. They are actually red  that's what gives blood its color. And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body. I was very much inspired by this image many years ago  and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world. What would it look like  And that's how I really began. So let's begin. This is DNA in its classic double helix form. And it's from X ray crystallography  so it's an accurate model of DNA. If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands  you see these things that look like teeth. Those are the letters of genetic code  the        genes you've got written in your DNA. This is what they typically talk about    the genetic code    this is what they're talking about. But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science  and that is the physical nature of DNA. It's these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can't go into right now. But they physically run in opposite directions  which creates a number of complications for your living cells  as you're about to see  most particularly when DNA is being copied. And so what I'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body  at least      biology. So DNA's entering the production line from the left hand side  and it hits this collection  these miniature biochemical machines  that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy. So DNA comes in and hits this blue  doughnut shaped structure and it's ripped apart into its two strands. One strand can be copied directly  and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there. But things aren't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards. So it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time  creating two new DNA molecules. Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you  copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity. It's an accurate representation  and it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you. I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things. This was work from a number of years ago. Thank you. This is work from a number of years ago  but what I'll show you next is updated science  it's updated technology. So again  we begin with DNA. And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules  which I've stripped away so you can see something. DNA is about two nanometers across  which is really quite tiny. But in each one of your cells  each strand of DNA is about    to    million nanometers long. So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code  it's wrapped around these purple proteins    or I've labeled them purple here. It's packaged up and bundled up. All this field of view is a single strand of DNA. This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome. And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute. We're pulling out  we're zooming out  out through a nuclear pore  which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA called the nucleus. All of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology  and I've got seven minutes. So we're not going to be able to do that today  No  I'm being told   No.  This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope. And it's been filmed under time lapse  which is why you can see it moving. The nuclear envelope breaks down. These sausage shaped things are the chromosomes  and we'll focus on them. They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots. When the cell feels it's ready to go  it rips apart the chromosome. One set of DNA goes to one side  the other side gets the other set of DNA    identical copies of DNA. And then the cell splits down the middle. And again  you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you. Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it. So again  here we are at that equator moment. The chromosomes line up. And if we isolate just one chromosome  we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure. So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have  at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us. So this is a single chromosome. And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome. One is bundled up into one sausage. The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage. These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell. They're called mircrotubules. That name's not important. But what we're going to focus on is this red region    I've labeled it red here    and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes. It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes. We have no idea really as to how it's achieving that movement. We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study  and we're still just beginning to discover what it's all about. It is made up of about     different types of proteins  thousands of proteins in total. It is a signal broadcasting system. It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it's ready  when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes. It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules. It's involved with the growing of the microtubules  and it's able to transiently couple onto them. It's also an attention sensing system. It's able to feel when the cell is ready  when the chromosome is correctly positioned. It's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right. And you'll see  there's this one little last bit that's still remaining red. And it's walked away down the microtubules. That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal. And it's walked away. I mean  it's that mechanical. It's molecular clockwork. This is how you work at the molecular scale. So with a little bit of molecular eye candy  we've got kinesins  which are the orange ones. They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way. And here are the dynein. They're carrying that broadcasting system. And they've got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on. So again  this is all derived accurately from the science. The problem is we can't show it to you any other way. Exploring at the frontier of science  at the frontier of human understanding  is mind blowing. Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science. But most medical researchers    discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals  which are to eradicate disease  to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty. Thank you. Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over    years last October. There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get. And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most. We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage  but we still can't do that with water  and here's why. Right now  if you want to test water in the field  you need a trained technician  expensive equipment like this  and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results. It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change  too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing. And it ignores the fact that  in the meanwhile  people still need to drink water. Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water  it came from forms like this  which documented all the people we failed to help. Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines    a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe. I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known. We think there's a simpler solution to this problem    one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday. It's in its early stages  but this is what it looks like right now. We call it the Water Canary. It's a fast  cheap device that answers an important question  Is this water contaminated  It doesn't require any special training. And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place  it uses light. That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place  no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information. To test water  you simply insert a sample and  within seconds  it either displays a red light  indicating contaminated water  or a green light  indicating the sample is safe. This will make it possible for anyone to collect life saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold. We're also  on top of that  integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM. What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time. With enough users  maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action  containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. And then  instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most  it can happen automatically. We've seen how distributed networks  big data and information can transform society. I think it's time for us to apply them to water. Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation  so we can tackle this problem together. Thank you. One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don't    into the religious and the atheists. And for the last decade or so  it's been quite clear what being an atheist means. There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out  not just that religion is wrong  but that it's ridiculous. These people  many of whom have lived in North Oxford  have argued    they've argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game. Now I think it's too easy. I think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way. And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. And what I'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist    if you like  a new version of atheism we could call Atheism  . . Now what is Atheism  .   Well it starts from a very basic premise  of course  there's no God. Of course  there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels  etc. Now let's move on  that's not the end of the story  that's the very  very beginning. I'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines  that thinks   I can't believe in any of this stuff. I can't believe in the doctrines. I don't think these doctrines are right. But   a very important but   I love Christmas carols. I really like the art of Mantegna. I really like looking at old churches. I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.  Whatever it may be  you know the kind of thing I'm talking about    people who are attracted to the ritualistic side  the moralistic  communal side of religion  but can't bear the doctrine. Until now  these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice. It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff  or you reject the doctrine and you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart. So that's a sort of tough choice. I don't think we have to make that choice. I think there is an alternative. I think there are ways    and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious    of stealing from religions. If you don't believe in a religion  there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing  with taking out the best sides of religion. And for me  atheism  .  is about both  as I say  a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying   What here could we use   The secular world is full of holes. We have secularized badly  I would argue. And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well. And I'd like to run through a few of these today. I'd like to kick off by looking at education. Now education is a field the secular world really believes in. When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place  we think education  that's where we put a lot of money. Education is going to give us  not only commercial skills  industrial skills  it's also going to make us better people. You know the kind of thing a commencement address is  and graduation ceremonies  those lyrical claims that education  the process of education    particularly higher education    will make us into nobler and better human beings. That's a lovely idea. Interesting where it came from. In the early   th century  church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very  very sharply  and people panicked. They asked themselves the following question. They said  where are people going to find the morality  where are they going to find guidance  and where are they going to find sources of consolation  And influential voices came up with one answer. They said culture. It's to culture that we should look for guidance  for consolation  for morality. Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare  the dialogues of Plato  the novels of Jane Austen. In there  we'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John. Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea. They wanted to replace scripture with culture. And that's a very plausible idea. It's also an idea that we have forgotten. If you went to a top university    let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge    and you said   I've come here because I'm in search of morality  guidance and consolation  I want to know how to live   they would show you the way to the insane asylum. This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of. Why  They don't think we need it. They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance. They see us as adults  rational adults. What we need is information. We need data  we don't need help. Now religions start from a very different place indeed. All religions  all major religions  at various points call us children. And like children  they believe that we are in severe need of assistance. We're only just holding it together. Perhaps this is just me  maybe you. But anyway  we're only just holding it together. And we need help. Of course  we need help. And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning. You know  in the   th century in the U.K.  the greatest preacher  greatest religious preacher  was a man called John Wesley  who went up and down this country delivering sermons  advising people how they could live. He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents  the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich. He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons  the classic medium of delivery of religions. Now we've given up with the idea of sermons. If you said to a modern liberal individualist   Hey  how about a sermon   they'd go   No  no. I don't need one of those. I'm an independent  individual person.  What's the difference between a sermon and our modern  secular mode of delivery  the lecture  Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information. And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition. The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable  because we are in need of guidance  morality and consolation    and religions know that. Another point about education  we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once  they'll remember it. Sit them in a classroom  tell them about Plato at the age of     send them out for a career in management consultancy for    years  and that lesson will stick with them. Religions go   Nonsense. You need to keep repeating the lesson    times a day. So get on your knees and repeat it.  That's what all religions tell us   Get on you knees and repeat it    or    or    times a day.  Otherwise our minds are like sieves. So religions are cultures of repetition. They circle the great truths again and again and again. We associate repetition with boredom.  Give us the new   we're always saying.  The new is better than the old.  If I said to you   Okay  we're not going to have new TED. We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true. We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever   you'd feel cheated. Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset. The other things that religions do is to arrange time. All the major religions give us calendars. What is a calendar  A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas. In the Catholic chronology  Catholic calendar  at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor. You won't do that by accident  you will do that because you are guided to do that. Now we don't think that way. In the secular world we think   If an idea is important  I'll bump into it. I'll just come across it.  Nonsense  says the religious world view. Religious view says we need calendars  we need to structure time  we need to synchronize encounters. This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings. Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon. You know  when you look at the Moon  you think   I'm really small. What are my problems   It sets things into perspective  etc.  etc. We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't. Why don't we  Well there's nothing to tell us   Look at the Moon.  But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September  you will be ordered out of your home  made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi  where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of. You'll be handed rice cakes. And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart. That's very good. The other thing that religions are really aware of is  speak well    I'm not doing a very good job of this here    but oratory  oratory is absolutely key to religions. In the secular world  you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career. But the religious world doesn't think that way. What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it. So if you go to an African American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk  my goodness  they talk well. After every convincing point  people will go   Amen  amen  amen.  At the end of a really rousing paragraph  they'll all stand up  and they'll go   Thank you Jesus  thank you Christ  thank you Savior.  If we were doing it like they do it    let's not do it  but if we were to do it    I would tell you something like   Culture should replace scripture.  And you would go   Amen  amen  amen.  And at the end of my talk  you would all stand up and you would go   Thank you Plato  thank you Shakespeare  thank you Jane Austen.  And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going. All right  all right. We're getting there. We're getting there. The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains  we are also bodies. And when they teach us a lesson  they do it via the body. So for example  take the Jewish idea of forgiveness. Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh. They don't just deliver us sermons on this. They don't just give us books or words about this. They tell us to have a bath. So in Orthodox Jewish communities  every Friday you go to a Mikveh. You immerse yourself in the water  and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea. We don't tend to do that. Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another. Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two. Let's look at art now. Now art is something that in the secular world  we think very highly of. We think art is really  really important. A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums  etc. We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals  or our new churches. You've heard that saying. Now I think that the potential is there  but we've completely let ourselves down. And the reason we've let ourselves down is that we're not properly studying how religions handle art. The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art  The first idea is that art should be for art's sake    a ridiculous idea    an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world. I couldn't disagree more. The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself  that artists shouldn't say what they're up to  because if they said it  it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy. That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum    let's admit it    is   I don't know what this is about.  But if we're serious people  we don't admit to that. But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art. Now religions have a much saner attitude to art. They have no trouble telling us what art is about. Art is about two things in all the major faiths. Firstly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to love. And secondly  it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate. And that's what art is. Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith. So as you walk around a church  or a mosque or a cathedral  what you're trying to imbibe  what you're imbibing is  through your eyes  through your senses  truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind. Essentially it's propaganda. Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view. Now the word  propaganda  sets off alarm bells. We think of Hitler  we think of Stalin. Don't  necessarily. Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something. And if that thing is good  there's no problem with it at all. My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions. And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum    if I was a museum curator  I would make a room for love  a room for generosity. All works of art are talking to us about things. And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told  use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind  we would get a lot more out of art. Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've neglected because of certain mis founded ideas. Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society. Art should be didactic. Let's think of something else. The people in the modern world  in the secular world  who are interested in matters of the spirit  in matters of the mind  in higher soul like concerns  tend to be isolated individuals. They're poets  they're philosophers  they're photographers  they're filmmakers. And they tend to be on their own. They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable  single people. And they get depressed and they get sad on their own. And they don't really change much. Now think about religions  think about organized religions. What do organized religions do  They group together  they form institutions. And that has all sorts of advantages. First of all  scale  might. The Catholic Church pulled in    billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal. These are massive machines. They're collaborative  they're branded  they're multinational  and they're highly disciplined. These are all very good qualities. We recognize them in relation to corporations. And corporations are very like religions in many ways  except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs. They're selling us shoes and cars. Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff    the therapists  the poets    are on their own and they have no power  they have no might. So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind. Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us  but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it. Books alone  books written by lone individuals  are not going to change anything. We need to group together. If you want to change the world  you have to group together  you have to be collaborative. And that's what religions do. They are multinational  as I say  they are branded  they have a clear identity  so they don't get lost in a busy world. That's something we can learn from. I want to conclude. Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields  there is something to learn from the example of religion    even if you don't believe any of it. If you're involved in anything that's communal  that involves lots of people getting together  there are things for you in religion. If you're involved  say  in a travel industry in any way  look at pilgrimage. Look very closely at pilgrimage. We haven't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel. If you're in the art world  look at the example of what religions are doing with art. And if you're an educator in any way  again  look at how religions are spreading ideas. You may not agree with the ideas  but my goodness  they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so. So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion  but at the end of the day  religions are so subtle  so complicated  so intelligent in many ways that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone  they're for all of us. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Now this is actually a courageous talk  because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters. AB  You can get shot by both sides. You can get shot by the hard headed atheists  and you can get shot by those who fully believe. CA  Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment. AB  Indeed. CA  But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from  which is this sense    that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious    of spiritual experience  of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are. Is there any room for that experience in Atheism  .   AB  Absolutely. I  like many of you  meet people who say things like   But isn't there something bigger than us  something else   And I say   Of course.  And they say   So aren't you sort of religious   And I go   No.  Why does that sense of mystery  that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe  need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling  Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it  so I don't feel the need. The universe is large and we are tiny  without the need for further religious superstructure. So one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit. CA  Actually  let me just ask a question. How many people here would say that religion is important to them  Is there an equivalent process by which there's a sort of bridge between what you're talking about and what you would say to them  AB  I would say that there are many  many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged. It's not as though  as I try to suggest  it's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things  or you don't have religion and then you're cut off from all these very good things. It's so sad that we constantly say   I don't believe so I can't have community  so I'm cut off from morality  so I can't go on a pilgrimage.  One wants to say   Nonsense. Why not   And that's really the spirit of my talk. There's so much we can absorb. Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion. CA  It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists. But probably most people in the community certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common. Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where  instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war  that there could be bridging  AB  No  we need to be polite about differences. Politeness is a much overlooked virtue. It's seen as hypocrisy. But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says   Well you know  I did pray the other day   you politely ignore it. You move on. Because you've agreed on    percent of things  because you have a shared view on so many things  and you politely differ. And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored. They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement. CA  And finally  does this new thing that you're proposing that's not a religion but something else  does it need a leader  and are you volunteering to be the pope  AB  Well  one thing that we're all very suspicious of is individual leaders. It doesn't need it. What I've tried to lay out is a framework and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in. I've sketched a sort of broad framework. But wherever you are  as I say  if you're in the travel industry  do that travel bit. If you're in the communal industry  look at religion and do the communal bit. So it's a wiki project. CA  Alain  thank you for sparking many conversations later. In the     s in the communist Eastern Germany  if you owned a typewriter  you had to register it with the government. You had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter. And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from. If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought  they could track down who created that thought. And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this  how much this would restrict freedom of speech. We would never do that in our own countries. But today in       if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page  that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer. This is happening to us today. And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us  the citizens. And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today. If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world  we can group the attacks based on the attackers. We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Like here  we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand. These guys make money. They use online attacks to make lots of money  and lots and lots of it. We actually have several cases of millionaires online  multimillionaires  who made money with their attacks. Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. This is Alfred Gonzalez. This is Stephen Watt. This is Bjorn Sundin. This is Matthew Anderson  Tariq Al Daour and so on and so on. These guys make their fortunes online  but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking  or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. The U.S. Secret Service  two months ago  froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here  and that bank account had   .  million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen. Mr. Jain himself is on the loose  nobody knows where he is. And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world. And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse. In the future  the majority of crime will be happening online. The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money. They're motivated by something else    motivated by protests  motivated by an opinion  motivated by the laughs. Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last    months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks. So those are the three main attackers  criminals who do it for the money  hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest  but then the last group are nation states  governments doing the attacks. And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar. This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens. DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands    or actually  it was. It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into. Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly. And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives  I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack. And his answer was yes. So how do people die as the result of a hack like this  Well DigiNotar is a C.A. They sell certificates. What do you do with certificates  Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https  SSL encrypted services  services like Gmail. Now we all  or a big part of us  use Gmail or one of their competitors  but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran  where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections  so the local government can't snoop on their discussions. Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A. and issue rogue certificates. And this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar. What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening  for example  in Egypt  Well in Egypt  the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April       and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. Among those papers  was this binder entitled  FINFISHER.  And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting    and in very large scale    all the communication of the citizens of the country. They had sold this tool for         Euros to the Egyptian government. The company headquarters are right here. So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens. But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. For example  in Germany  just a couple of weeks ago the so called State Trojan was found  which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens. If you are a suspect in a criminal case  well it's pretty obvious  your phone will be tapped. But today  it goes beyond that. They will tap your Internet connection. They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan  which enables them to watch all your communication  to listen to your online discussions  to collect your passwords. Now when we think deeper about things like these  the obvious response from people should be that   Okay  that sounds bad  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen. Why should I worry  Because I have nothing to hide.  And this is an argument  which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question between privacy against security. It's a question of freedom against control. And while we might trust our governments right now  right here in       any right we give away will be given away for good. And do we trust  do we blindly trust  any future government  a government we might have    years from now  And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next    years. I'm going to start here. This is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago. The store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar. And kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake. But unfortunately  one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. They liked to draw the Little Mermaid  they'd like to draw a smurf  they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. But it turns out to be illegal to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse onto a plate of sugar. And it's a copyright violation. And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said   You know what  we're getting out of that business. If you're an amateur  you don't have access to our machine anymore. If you want a printed sugar birthday cake  you have to use one of our prefab images    only for professionals.  So there's two bills in Congress right now. One is called SOPA  the other is called PIPA. SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. It's from the Senate. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP  which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property    because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands. And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs. Now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright    although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills    and then they want to remove them from the domain name system. They want to take them out of the domain name system. Now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names  like Google.com  into the kinds of addresses machines expect      .   .   .   . Now the problem with this model of censorship  of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system  is that it won't work. And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law  but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much. Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type   .   .   .    into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act. Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals  but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  you have to understand a little bit about the back story. And the back story is this  SOPA and PIPA  as legislation  were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the   th century. The   th century was a great time to be a media company  because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity. If you were making a TV show  it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made  it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time    which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty. Which meant that if you fielded average content  you got a third of the U.S. public for free    tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn't too terrible. This is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink. But technology moved on  as technology is wont to do. And slowly  slowly  at the end of the   th century  that scarcity started to get eroded    and I don't mean by digital technology  I mean by analog technology. Cassette tapes  video cassette recorders  even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. We don't really like to only consume. We do like to consume  but every time one of these new tools came along  it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share. And this freaked the media businesses out    it freaked them out every time. Jack Valenti  who was the head lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America  once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to Jack the Ripper and poor  helpless Hollywood to a woman at home alone. That was the level of rhetoric. And so the media industries begged  insisted  demanded that Congress do something. And Congress did something. By the early   s  Congress passed the law that changed everything. And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of     . What the Audio Home Recording Act of      said was  look  if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime. That's okay. Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them  that's not okay. But this taping business  fine  let it go. And they thought that they clarified the issue  because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full stop. So when the Audio Home Recording Act of      was passed  the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment. So they went for plan B. It took them a while to formulate plan B. Plan B appeared in its first full blown form in         something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was a complicated piece of legislation  a lot of moving parts. But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material    except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. It would be  as Ed Felton once famously said   Like handing out water that wasn't wet.  Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. That is a side effect of their ordinary operation. So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits  the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home    no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it    could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. And to make sure you didn't realize  or didn't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices  they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content. The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means. Now the DMCA had  and is continuing to have  a lot of complicated effects  but in this one domain  limiting sharing  it has mostly not worked. And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. The mixtape  the fanzine  that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now with the Internet. We are in a world where most American citizens over the age of    share things with each other online. We share written things  we share images  we share audio  we share video. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found  and all of it horrifies those industries. So PIPA and SOPA are round two. But where the DMCA was surgical    we want to go down into your computer  we want to go down into your television set  down into your game machine  and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store    PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying  we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Now the mechanism  as I said  for doing this  is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. You need to take them out of search engines  you need to take them out of online directories  you need to take them out of user lists. And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo  they're us  we're the people getting policed. Because in the end  the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another. So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept  innocent until proven guilty  and reversing it    guilty until proven innocent. You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. Suddenly  the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities. And if it costs even a dime to police a user  that will crush a service with a hundred million users. So this is the Internet they have in mind. Imagine this sign everywhere    except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery  imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. Imagine it says TED  because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. The threat  in fact  is this inversion of the burden of proof  where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create  to produce or to share. And the people who provide those capabilities to us    the YouTubes  the Facebooks  the Twitters and TEDs    are in the business of having to police us  or being on the hook for contributory infringement. There's two things you can do to help stop this    a simple thing and a complicated thing  an easy thing and a hard thing. The simple thing  the easy thing  is this  if you're an American citizen  call your representative  call your senator. When you look at the people who co signed on the SOPA bill  people who've co signed on PIPA  what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries. You don't have millions and millions of dollars  but you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. And if you're not an American citizen  you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. Because this seems like a national issue  but it is not. These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet. If they break it  they will break it for everybody. That's the easy thing. That's the simple thing. The hard thing is this  get ready  because more is coming. SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA  which was purposed last year  which did not pass. And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act  which horrified those industries. Because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that  that turns out to be really inconvenient.  We'd prefer not to do that   says the content industries. And what they want is not to have to do that. They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. They just want the sharing to go away. PIPA and SOPA are not oddities  they're not anomalies  they're not events. They're the next turn of this particular screw  which has been going on    years now. And if we defeat these  as I hope we do  more is coming. Because until we convince Congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster  with YouTube  which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies. That's the way to handle this. In the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready. Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming    not producing  not sharing    and we should say   No.  Thank you. Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day  Do you know how many choices you make in typical week  I recently did a survey with over       Americans  and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about    in a typical day. There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks. And they found that the average CEO engaged in about     tasks in a week. Each task was made up of many  many  many sub choices of course.    percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less. Only about    percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. Think about your own choices. Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category  How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices  Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have  which is the choice overload problem. I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions. Now as I talk about this problem  I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. So when I ask you a question  since I'm blind  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. Otherwise  when I ask you a question  and if your answer is yes  I'd like you to clap your hands. So for my first question for you today  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem  Thank you. So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University  I used to go to this very  very upscale grocery store  at least at that time it was truly upscale. It was a store called Draeger's. Now this store  it was almost like going to an amusement park. They had     different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over     different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water    and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. I used to love going to this store  but on one occasion I asked myself  well how come you never buy anything  Here's their olive oil aisle. They had over    different kinds of olive oil  including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand year old olive trees. So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager  and I asked the manager   Is this model of offering people all this choice really working   And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday  with cameras ready usually. We decided to do a little experiment  and we picked jam for our experiment. Here's their jam aisle. They had     different kinds of jam. We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store. We there put out six different flavors of jam or    different flavors of jam  and we looked at two things  First  in which case were people more likely to stop  sample some jam  More people stopped when there were     about    percent  than when there were six  about    percent. The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. Now we see the opposite effect. Of the people who stopped when there were     only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Of the people who stopped when there were six  well now we saw that    percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Now if you do the math  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered   . Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us    at least it's good for our waistlines    but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose  even when it goes against our best self interests. So now for the topic of today  financial savings. Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman  Emir Kamenica  Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about     plans all in the U.S. And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan  the     k  plan  does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. So in these plans  we had about     plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to    different fund offerings. And what we found was that  the more funds offered  indeed  there was less participation rate. So if you look at the extremes  those plans that offered you two funds  participation rates were around in the mid   s    still not as high as we want it to be. In those plans that offered nearly    funds  participation rates have now dropped to about the   th percentile. Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present  even then  it has negative consequences. So for those people who did choose to participate  the more choices available  the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. The more choices available  the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well being. Well  over the past decade  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. They're more likely to delay choosing    procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest. They're more likely to make worse choices    worse financial choices  medical choices. They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied  even when they do objectively better. The main reason for this is because  we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises  mustards  vinegars  jams  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques    techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues    that you can easily apply in your businesses. The first  Cut. You've heard it said before  but it's never been more true than today  that less is more. People are always upset when I say   Cut.  They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. But in fact  what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut  get rid of those extraneous redundant options  well there's an increase in sales  there's a lowering of costs  there is an improvement of the choosing experience. When Proctor   Gamble went from    different kinds of Head   Shoulders to     they saw an increase in sales by    percent. When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their    worst selling cat litter products  they saw an increase in profits by    percent    a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs. You know  the average grocery store today offers you        products. The typical Walmart today offers you         products. But the ninth largest retailer  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi  and it offers you only       products    one kind of canned tomato sauce. Now in the financial savings world  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing  which was the program that they have at Harvard. Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund. For those people who actually want to choose  they're given    funds  not     or more funds. You know  often  people say   I don't know how to cut. They're all important choices.  And the first thing I do is I ask the employees   Tell me how these choices are different from one another. And if your employees can't tell them apart  neither can your consumers.  Now before we started our session this afternoon  I had a chat with Gary. And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. Here's a description of the road. And I'd like you to read it. And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. Is that all  All right  let me show you some more about this. You guys knew there was a trick  didn't you. Now who's ready to go on this trip. I think I might have actually heard more hands. All right. Now in fact  you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around  but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. Because the pictures made it feel more real to you. Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem  which is concretization. That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices  they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice  and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way  in a very concrete way. Why do people spend an average of    to    percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash  Because it doesn't feel like real money. And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero  we did a study with people at ING    employees that are all working at ING    and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their     k  plan. And during that session  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be  but we added one little thing. The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. By doing that simple thing  there was an increase in enrollment by    percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. The third technique  Categorization. We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. So for example  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor  the magazine aisles range anywhere from     different kinds of magazines all the way up to    . But you know what  If I show you     magazines and I divide them up into    categories  versus I show you     magazines and divide them up into    categories  you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the     than if I gave you the    . Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. Here are two different jewelry displays. One is called  Jazz  and the other one is called  Swing.  If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz  clap your hands. Okay  there's some. If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  clap your hands. Okay  a bit more. Now it turns out you're right. The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing  but you know what  This is a highly useless categorization scheme. The categories need to say something to the chooser  not the choice maker. And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. Who are they actually supposed to be informing  My fourth technique  Condition for complexity. It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can  we've just got to take it a little easier. We have to gradually increase the complexity. I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. Let's take a very  very complicated decision  buying a car. Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. You've got to make    different decisions  completely make up your car. Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. Car colors  exterior car colors    I've got    choices. Engines  gearshift    four choices. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. So half of the customers are going to go from high choice     car colors  to low choice  four gearshifts. The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice  four gearshifts  to    car colors  high choice. What am I going to look at  How engaged you are. If you keep hitting the default button per decision  that means you're getting overwhelmed  that means I'm losing you. What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. We're losing them. They go from low choice to high choice  they're hanging in there. It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. If I start you off easy  I learn how to choose. Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor  it still prepares me for how to choose. It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together  so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. So let me recap. I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload    cut    get rid of the extraneous alternatives  concretize    make it real  categorize    we can handle more categories  less choices  condition for complexity. All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices    better for you  you can use them on yourself  better for the people that you are serving. Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. Thank you very much. What I'm going to do is  I'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland  Ohio. But before I do that  we have to go over the definition of what green is  'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it. Green. The product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means. There's plenty of things that are being called green now. What does it actually mean  We use three metrics to determine green. The first metric is  Is it sustainable  Which means  are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations  Is it alternative  Is it different than what is being used today  or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally  And three  Is it renewable  Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources  such as sun  wind and water  Now  my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels. Extreme green. Why aviation  The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined. We need to find an alternative. Also it's a national aeronautics directive. One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels  biofuels  using domestic and safe  friendly resources. Now  combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric   Actually  extreme green for us is all three together  that's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that. So it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric. Ninety seven percent of the world's water is saltwater. How about we use that  Combine that with number three. Do not use arable land. Because crops are already growing on that land that's very scarce around the world. Number two  Don't compete with food crops. That's already a well established entity  they don't need another entry. And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth is fresh water. Don't use fresh water. If   .  percent of the world's water is saltwater   .  percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use. But    percent of the population lives within that one percent. So  combating my problem was  now I have to be extreme green and meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility. This is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes. A halophyte is a salt tolerating plant. Most plants don't like salt  but halophytes tolerate salt. We also are using weeds and we are also using algae. The good thing about our lab is  we've had       visitors in the last two years. Why do you think that's so  Because we are on to something special. So  in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously  and on the right hand side you'll see algae. If you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels  algae is a viable option  there's a lot of funding right now  and we have an algae to fuels program. There's two types of algae growing. One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here  and what you see on the other side is our species   we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus. Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors. Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are  They are quite expensive  they are automated  and it's very difficult to get them in large scale. So on large scale what do they use  We use open pond systems. Now  around the world they are growing algae  with this racetrack design that you see here. Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well  but when it gets around the last turn  which I call turn four   it's stagnant. We actually have a solution for that. In the GreenLab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature  waves. We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems. We have    percent mixing and our lipid content is higher than a closed photobioreactor system  which we think is significant. There is a drawback to algae  however  It's very expensive. Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively  And the answer is  yes. We do the same thing we do with halophytes  and that is  climatic adaptation. In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater. What we do  We take a potential species  we start at freshwater  we add a little bit more salt  when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as Brazil   right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants   the next tank represents Africa  the next tank represents Arizona  the next tank represents Florida  and the next tank represents California or the open ocean. What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world  where there's barren desert. We are being very successful so far. Now  here's one of the problems. If you are a farmer  you need five things to be successful  You need seeds  you need soil  you need water and you need sun  and the last thing that you need is fertilizer. Most people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what  We do not use chemical fertilizer. Wait a second  I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer. Believe it or not  in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems    percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves. The    percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous. We have a natural solution  fish. No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there. Fish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies  that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater. Freshwater mollies  cheap  they love to make babies  and they love to go to the bathroom. And the more they go to the bathroom  the more fertilizer we get  the better off we are  believe it or not. It should be noted that we use sand as our soil  regular beach sand. Fossilized coral. So a lot of people ask me   How did you get started   Well  we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab. It's a seedling lab. We have    different species of halophytes  and five are winners. What we do here is   actually it should be called a death lab  'cause we try to kill the seedlings  make them rough   and then we come to the GreenLab. What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing  a macro algae that I'll talk about in a minute. And lastly  it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work  I don't just talk about what I do. Here's the plant species. Salicornia virginica. It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant. Everywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place  from Maine all the way to California. We love that plant. Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world. It is the highest lipid content that we have  but it has a shortcoming  It's short. Now you take europaea  which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have. And what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology   combine all three to make a high growth  high lipid plant. Next  when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay   soybean fields gone   we came up with an idea  Can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware  And the answer is yes. It's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica   say that five times fast if you can. This is a     percent usable plant. The seeds  biofuels. The rest  cattle feed. It's there for    years  it's working very well. Now we get to Chaetomorpha. This is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks. This species is so significant to us. The properties are very close to plastic. We are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a bioplastic. If we are successful  we will revolutionize the plastics industry. So  we have a seed to fuel program. We have to do something with this biomass that we have. And so we do G.C. extraction  lipid optimization  so on and so forth  because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels  aviation specifics  so on and so forth. So far we talked about water and fuel  but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia  It's a food product. So we talk about ideas worth spreading  right  How about this  In sub Saharan Africa  next to the sea  saltwater  barren desert  how about we take that plant  plant it  half use for food  half use for fuel. We can make that happen  inexpensively. You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany that sells it as a health food product. This is harvested  and in the middle here is a shrimp dish  and it's being pickled. So I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans  saltwater asparagus and pickle weed. So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle. Oh  I thought it was funny.  Laughter  And at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense  this is a logical snack. You have mustard  you are a seaman  you see the halophyte  you mix it together  it's a great snack with some crackers. And last  garlic with Salicornia  which is what I like. So  water  fuel and food. None of this is possible without the GreenLab team. Just like the Miami Heat has the big three  we have the big three at NASA GRC. That's myself  professor Bob Hendricks  our fearless leader  and Dr. Arnon Chait. The backbone of the GreenLab is students. Over the last two years we've had    different students from around the world working at GreenLab. As a matter fact my division chief says a lot   You have a green university.  I say   I'm okay with that  'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers  which is significant.  So  in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food  fuel and water. There's something missing to be complete. Clearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you   We're using clean energy sources here. So  we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab  we have four or five more hopefully coming soon. We are also using something that is quite interesting   there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center  hasn't been used for    years. Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues  we realized that they are still viable  so we are refurbishing them right now. In about    days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab. And the reason why you see red  red and yellow  is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday   This is a picture taken on Saturday. There are no cars around  but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday.  Laughter  This is a proof to you that I'm working. 'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done  most people know that. Here's a concept with this  We are using the GreenLab for a micro grid test bed for the smart grid concept in Ohio. We have the ability to do that  and I think it's going to work. So  GreenLab Research Facility. A self sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today. We really  really hope this concept catches on worldwide. We think we have a solution for food  water  fuel and now energy. Complete. It's extreme green  it's sustainable  alternative and renewable and it meets the big three at GRC  Don't use arable land  don't compete with food crops  and most of all  don't use fresh water. So I get a lot of questions about   What are you doing in that lab   And I usually say   None of your business  that's what I'm doing in the lab.   Laughter  And believe it or not  my number one goal for working on this project is I want to help save the world. Is there a real you  This might seem to you  like a very odd question. Because  you might ask  how do we find the real you  how do you know what the real you is  And so forth. But the idea that there must be a real you  surely that's obvious. If there's anything real  in the world  it's you. Well  I'm not quite sure. At least we have to understand  a bit better what that means. Now certainly  I think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us  we have a kind of a core  an essence. There is something about what it means to be you which defines you  and it's kind of permanent and unchanging. The most kind of crude way in which we have it  are things like horoscopes. You know  people are very wedded to these  actually. People put them on their Facebook profile as though they are meaningul  you even know  your Chinese horoscope as well. There are also  more scientific versions of this  all sorts of ways of profiling personality type  such as the Myers Briggs tests  for example. I don't know if you've done those. A lot of companies  use these for recruitment. You answer a lot of questions  and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality. And of course  the popular fascination  with this is enormous. In magazines like this  you'll see  in the bottom left corner  they'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing. And if you pick up one of those magazines  it's hard to resist  isn't it  Doing the test to find what is your learning style  what is your loving style  or what is your working style  Are you this kind of person or that  So I think that we have a common sense idea that there is a kind of core  or essence of ourselves to be discovered. And that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves  something that's the same throughout life. Well  that's the idea I want to challenge. And I have to say now  I'll say it a bit later  but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird  the challenge actually has a very  very long and distinguished history. Here's the common sense idea. There is you. You are the individuals you are  and you have this kind of core. Now in your life  what happens is that you  of course  accumulate different experiences and so forth. So you have memories  and these memories help  to create what you are. You have desires  maybe for a cookie  maybe for something that we don't want to talk about at    o'clock in the morning in a school. You will have beliefs. This is a number plate from someone in America. I don't know whether this number plate  which says  messiah     indicates that the driver believes in the messiah  or that they are the messiah. Either way  they have beliefs  about messiahs. We have knowledge. We have sensations and experiences as well. It's not just intellectual things. So this is kind of  the common sense model  I think  of what a person is. There is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences. But the suggestion  I want to put to you today is that there's something  fundamentally wrong with this model. And I can show you what's wrong with one click. Which is there isn't actually a  you  at the heart of all these experiences. Strange thought  Well  maybe not. What is there  then  Well  clearly there are memories  desires  intentions  sensations  and so forth. But what happens is these things exist  and they're kind of all integrated  they're overlapped  they're connected in various different ways. They're connecting partly  and perhaps even mainly  because they all belong to one body and one brain. But there's also a narrative   a story we tell about ourselves  the experiences we have when we remember past things. We do things because of other things. So what we desire is partly a result of what we believe  and what we remember is also informing us what we know. And so really  there are all these things  like beliefs  desires   sensations  experiences  they're all related to each other  and that just is you. In some ways  it's a small difference from the common sense understanding. In some ways  it's a massive one. It's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has  all the experiences of life  and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life. You are the sum of your parts. Now those parts are also physical parts   of course  brains  bodies and legs and things  but they aren't so important  actually. If you have a heart transplant  you're still the same person. If you have a memory transplant  are you the same person  If you have a belief transplant   would you be the same person  Now this idea  that what we are   the way to understand ourselves  is as not of some permanent being  which has experiences  but is kind of a collection of experiences  might strike you as kind of weird. But actually  I don't think  it should be weird. In a way  it's common sense. Because I just invite you  to think about  by comparison  think about pretty much anything else in the universe  maybe apart from the  very most fundamental forces or powers. Let's take something like water. Now my science isn't very good. We might say something like  water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen  right  We all know that. I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water   and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms  and that's what water is. Of course we don't. We understand  very easily  very straightforwardly  that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged. Everything else in the universe is the same. There's no mystery about my watch  for example. We say the watch has a face  and hands  and a mechanism and a battery  But what we really mean is  we don't think  there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits. We understand very clearly  that you get the parts of the watch  you put them together  and you create a watch. Now if everything else  in the universe is like this  why are we different  Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being  a collection of all our parts  but somehow being a separate  permanent entity which has those parts  Now this view is not particularly new   actually. It has quite a long lineage. You find it in Buddhism  you find it in   th     th century philosophy going through to the current day  people like Locke and Hume. But interestingly  it's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience. This is Paul Broks   he's a clinical neuropsychologist  and he says this   We have a deep intuition that there is a core  an essence there   and it's hard to shake off  probably impossible to shake off   I suspect. But it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together.  So when you look at the brain  and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self  you find that there isn't  a central control spot in the brain. There is no kind of center where everything happens. There are lots of different processes in the brain  all of which operate  in a way  quite independently. But it's because of the way  that they relate that we get this sense of self. The term I use in the book   I call it the ego trick. It's like a mechanical trick. It's not that we don't exist  it's just that the trick is  to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there. Now you might think this is a worrying idea. You might think that if it's true  that for each one of us there is no abiding core of self  no permanent essence  does that mean that really  the self is an illusion  Does it mean that we really don't exist  There is no real you. Well  a lot of people actually do use  this talk of illusion and so forth. These are three psychologists  Thomas Metzinger  Bruce Hood  Susan Blackmore  a lot of these people do talk  the language of illusion  the self is an illusion  it's a fiction. But I don't think this is  a very helpful way of looking at it. Go back to the watch. The watch isn't an illusion   because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts. In the same way   we're not illusions either. The fact that we are  in some ways  just this very  very complex collection  ordered collection of things  does not mean we're not real. I can give you  a very sort of rough metaphor for this. Let's take something like a waterfall. These are the Iguazu Falls  in Argentina. Now if you take something like this  you can appreciate the fact  that in lots of ways  there's nothing permanent about this. For one thing  it's always changing. The waters  are always carving new channels. with changes and tides and the weather  some things dry up   new things are created. Of course the water that flows  through the waterfall is different every single instance. But it doesn't mean that  the Iguazu Falls are an illusion. It doesn't mean it's not real. What it means is we have  to understand what it is as something which has a history  has certain things that keep it together  but it's a process  it's fluid   it's forever changing. Now that  I think  is a model for understanding ourselves  and I think it's a liberating model. Because if you think that you have this fixed  permanent essence  which is always the same  throughout your life  no matter what  in a sense you're kind of trapped. You're born with an essence  that's what you are until you die  if you believe in an afterlife   maybe you continue. But if you think of yourself as being  in a way  not a thing as such   but a kind of a process  something that is changing  then I think that's quite liberating. Because unlike the the waterfalls  we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree. Now we've got to be careful here  right  If you watch the X Factor too much  you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be. That's not true. I've heard some fantastic musicians this morning  and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them. I could practice hard  and maybe be good  but I don't have that really natural ability. There are limits to what we can achieve. There are limits to what  we can make of ourselves. But nevertheless  we do have  this capacity to  in a sense  shape ourselves. The true self  as it were then  is not something that is just there for you to discover  you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self  What you are partly doing  at least  is actually creating your true self. And this  I think  is very  very significant  particularly at this stage of life you're at. You'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years. If you have any videos of yourself   three or four years ago  you probably feel embarrassed  because you don't recognize yourself. So I want to get that message over  that what we need to do is think about ourselves as things that we can shape  and channel and change. This is the Buddha  again   Well makers lead the water  fletchers bend the arrow  carpenters bend a log of wood  wise people fashion themselves.  And that's the idea  I want to leave you with  that your true self is not something  that you will have to go searching for  as a mystery  and maybe never ever find. To the extent you have a true self  it's something that you in part discover  but in part create. and that  I think   is a liberating and exciting prospect. Thank you very much. It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web    product data  I should say  from the Web    perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste  and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot. We can actually build for you  very rapidly  a physical object. And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing  or  D printing. This is a  D printer. They have been around for almost    years now  which is quite amazing to think of  but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena. And typically  you would take data  like the data of a pen here  which would be a geometric representation of that product in  D  and we would pass that data with material into a machine. And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built. And we can take out the physical product  and ready to use  or to  perhaps  assemble into something else. But if these machines have been around for almost    years  why don't we know about them  Because typically they've been too inefficient  inaccessible  they've not been fast enough  they've been quite expensive. But today  it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful. Many barriers are breaking down. That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines  if not this minute. And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing  and most certainly our lives  our businesses and the lives of our children. So how does it work  It typically reads CAD data  which is a product design data created on professional product design programs. And here you can see an engineer    it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer    create a product in  D. And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two dimensional representations of that product all the way through    almost like slicing it like salami. And that data  layer by layer  gets passed through the machine  starting at the base of the product and depositing material  layer upon layer  infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process. And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form. And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting. In this case  we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS. It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer. And over time    quite rapidly actually  in a number of hours    we can build a physical product  ready to take out of the machine and use. And this is quite an extraordinary idea  but it is reality today. So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way. They were all  D printed. And you can see  they're ranging from shoes  rings that were made out of stainless steal  phone covers out of plastic  all the way through to spinal implants  for example  that were created out of medical grade titanium  and engine parts. But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very  very intricate. The design is quite extraordinary. Because we're taking this data in  D form  slicing it up before it gets past the machine  we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology    or  in fact  are impossible to build in any other way. And you can create parts with moving components  hinges  parts within parts. So in some cases  we can abolish totally the need for manual labor. It sounds great. It is great. We can have  D printers today that build structures like these. This is almost three meters high. And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to    mm in thickness    slowly growing this structure. This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro. And you can actually walk into it. And on the other end of the spectrum  this is a microstructure. It's created depositing layers of about four microns. So really the resolution is quite incredible. The detail that you can get today is quite amazing. So who's using it  Typically  because we can create products very rapidly  it's been used by product designers  or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design. And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse. There's very little economies of scale. So you can now create one offs very easily. Architects  for example  they want to create prototypes of buildings. Again you can see  this is a building of the Free University in Berlin and it was designed by Foster and Partners. Again  not buildable in any other way. And very hard to even create this by hand. Now this is an engine component. It was developed by a company called Within Technologies and  T RPD. It's very  very  very detailed inside with the design. Now  D printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production. If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here  you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it  which means it's a more efficient product. You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually. It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid. And it's used by aerospace and automotive. It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste. So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products. And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure  we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants. Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous  because our body tissue will grow into it. There's a lower chance of rejection. But it's very hard to create that in standard ways. With  D printing  we're seeing today that we can create much better implants. And in fact  because we can create bespoke products en masse  one offs  we can create implants that are specific to individuals. So as you can see  this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic. And we're starting to see it being used for final end products. And in fact  as the detail is improving  the quality is improving  the price of the machines are falling and they're becoming quicker. They're also now small enough to sit on a desktop. You can buy a machine today for about      that you can create yourself  which is quite incredible. But then it begs the question  why don't we all have one in our home  Because  simply  most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a  D printer reads. If I gave you a  D printer  you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to. But there are more and more technologies  software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers. I believe we're at a tipping point where this is now something that we can't avoid. This technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and  I believe  cause a revolution in manufacturing. So today  you can download products from the Web    anything you would have on your desktop  like pens  whistles  lemon squeezers. You can use software like Google SketchUp to create products from scratch very easily.  D printing can be also used to download spare parts from the Web. So imagine you have  say  a Hoover in your home and it has broken down. You need a spare part  but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued. Can you imagine going online    this is a reality    and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information  that data  and having the product made for you at home  ready to use  on your demand  And in fact  because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making themselves. You're having machines fabricate themselves. These are parts of a RepRap machine  which is a kind of desktop printer. But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse. There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China. You can just make it physically on the spot. Which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization. This is something that is now possible today  that you can direct personally how you want your products to look. We're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization. Brands like Nike are doing it. It's all over the Web. In fact  every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products on a daily basis    all the way from Smart Cars to Prada to Ray Ban  for example. But this is not really mass customization  it's known as variant production  variations of the same product. What you could do is really influence your product now and shape manipulate your product. I'm not sure about you guys  but I've had experiences when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that I know where I want to sit in my house and I just can't find the right thing  or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself. Imagine that you can now engage with a brand and interact  so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you're about to buy. You can today download a product with software like this  view the product in  D. This is the sort of  D data that a machine will read. This is a lamp. And you can start iterating the design. You can direct what color that product will be  perhaps what material. And also  you can engage in shape manipulation of that product  but within boundaries that are safe. Because obviously the public are not professional product designers. The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible. And when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design  they click  Enter  and this data gets converted into the data that a  D printer reads and gets passed to a  D printer  perhaps on someone's desktop. But I don't think that that's immediate. I don't think that will happen soon. What's more likely  and we're seeing it today  is that data gets sent to a local manufacturing center. This means lower carbon footprint. We're now  instead of shipping a product across the world  we're sending data across the Internet. Here's the product being built. You can see  this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later. It's this lamp  as you can see here. So as long as you have the data  you can create the part on demand. And you don't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization  you can use it for functional customization  scanning parts of the body and creating things that are made to fit. So we can run this through to something like prosthetics  which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap. Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual. Scanning teeth today  you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you. While you wait at the dentist  a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth. And the idea of now creating implants  scanning data  an MRI scan of somebody can now be converted into  D data and we can create very specific implants for them. And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies. You know  this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree. It's very intricate. You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way. But with MRI data  we can just build the product  as you can see  very intricately. Using this process  pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today. So one of the pioneers  for example  is Dr. Anthony Atala  and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts    bladders  valves  kidneys. Now this is not something that's ready for the public  but it is in working progress. So just to finalize  we're all individual. We all have different preferences  different needs. We like different things. We're all different sizes and our companies the same. Businesses want different things. Without a doubt in my mind  I believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it. Thank you. Yeah  so a couple of years ago I was turning     and I don't like being   . And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life. It wasn't the resume of breaking this record here  it was more like  who had I become  How had I spent my valuable time  How could this have gone by like lightning  And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless  countless hours I had lost in negative thought    all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this. Just why  why didn't I do it better  Why  Why  Why  And then my mother died at   . And so I starting thinking  not only am I not happy with the past  now I'm getting choked with   I've only got    years left.  What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting  And I'm not in the present whatsoever. And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream  an extreme dream  something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion  something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life  every minute of every day  because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction. And I decided  it was an old dream that was lingering  that was from so many years ago  three decades ago    the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my   s    was going from Cuba to Florida. It was deep in my imagination. No one's ever done it without a shark cage. It's daunting. It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean. It's probably  at my speed  at my age    for anybody's speed at anybody's age    going to take     maybe     hours of continuous swimming  never getting out on the boat. And I started to train. I hadn't swum for    years  not a stroke. And I had kept in good shape  but swimming's a whole different animal. As a matter of fact  this picture is supposed to be me during training. It's a smiling face. And when you're training for this sport  you are not smiling. It's an arduous  difficult sport  and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport. As I said  I respect other sports  and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events  but this is a sensory deprivation  a physical duress. And when I started in with the eight hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hours and the    hour swims  I knew I had it  because I was making it through these. And when I said I'm going to go out and do a    hour swim  and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night  and we come in and it's    hours and    minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done  the trainer says   That's great. It's    hours    minutes. Who cares the last two minutes   I say   No  it's got to be    hours   and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the    hours. And I put together an expedition. It's not that I didn't have help  but honestly  I sort of led  I was the team leader. And to get the government permissions  you read in the paper  you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday  Try going in with an armada like we had of    people and five boats and CNN's crew  etc. The navigation is difficult. There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it's not going in the direction you are. It's going to the east and you'd like to go north. It's tricky. And there's dehydration. And there's hypothermia. And there are sharks. And there are all kinds of problems. And I gathered together  honestly  the world's leading experts in every possible way. And a month ago  the   rd of September  I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long  long faraway horizon and I asked myself  do you have it  Are your shoulders ready  And they were. They were prepared. No stone left unturned. Was the mind ready  You know  you're swimming with the fogged goggles  you're swimming at    strokes a minute  so you're never really focused on anything  you don't see well. You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head  because it's where the hypothermia starts  and so you don't hear very well. You're really left alone with your own thoughts. And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English  followed by German  followed by Spanish  followed by French. You save the French for last. And I had songs  I had a playlist in my head    not through headphones  in my own head    of    songs. And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night  because that's when Neil Young comes out. And it's odd  isn't it  You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's  Hallelujah  out in the majesty of the ocean  not songs about heroin addiction in New York City. But no  for some reason I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing     A heard you knocking at my cellar door     I love you baby and I want some more     Ooh  ooh  the damage done    The night before I started  I finished Stephen Hawking's  The Grand Design.  And I couldn't wait to trip the mind fantastic. About the   th hour  I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe. Is there an edge  Is this an envelope we're living inside of  or no  does it go onto infinity in both time and space  And there's nothing like swimming for    hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this. I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am  that nobody else in the world can do this swim. And I knew I could do it. And when I jumped into that water  I yelled in my mother's French   Courage   And I started swimming  and  oh my God  it was glassy. And we knew it  all    people on the boat  we all knew this was it  this was our time. And I reminded myself a couple hours in  you know  the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself. First of all  you're going to hit obstacles. And even though you're feeling great at any one moment  don't take it for granted  be ready  because there's going to be pain  there's going to be suffering. It's not going to feel this good all the way across. And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things    the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater. You're immersed in the liquid. Your body doesn't like the saltwater. After a couple of days  three days  you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways. But no  two hours in  wham  Never in my life ... I knew there were Portuguese men o' war  all kinds of moon jellies  all kinds of things  but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters. And I was on fire    excruciating  excruciating pain. I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm. Evidently  a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin  it's sending a venom. The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish. And every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system. So first I feel like boiling hot oil  I've been dipped in. And I'm yelling out   Fire  Fire  Fire  Fire  Help me  Somebody help me   And the next thing is paralysis. I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here  and I can't breathe. And now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke  I'm sort of crabbing it this way. Then come convulsions. A young man on our boat is an EMT. He dives in to try to help me. He's stung. They drag him out on the boat  and he's    evidently  I didn't see any of this    but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out. He's    years old  very well built  lean  he's six foot  five  weighs     lbs.  and he is down. And he is crying and he's yelling to my trainer who's trying to help me. And he's saying   Bonnie  I think I'm going to die. My breath is down to three breaths a minute. I need help  and I can't help Diana.  So that was at eight o'clock at night. The doctor  medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning. So I swam through the night  and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots. I didn't get out  but was in the water taking prednisone shots  taking Xanax  oxygen to the face. It was like an ICU unit in the water. And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly  they're done. They either die or they quickly get to a hospital. And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day. And the next night at dusk  again  wham  The box jelly again    all across the neck  all across here. And this time  I don't like it  I didn't want to give into it  but there's a difference between a non stop swim and a staged swim. And I gave in to the staged swim. And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board. And I got back in. And I swam through that night and into the next day. And at    hours  this body couldn't make it. The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted. And the dream was crushed. And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together. And I knew about the jellyfish  but I was sort of cavalier. A lot of athletes have this  you know  sort of invincibility. They should worry about me. I don't worry about them. I'll just swim right through them. We've got benadryl on board. If I get stung  I'll just grin and bear it. Well there was no grin and bearing this. As a matter of fact  the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean. And I was telling these kids      of them    they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor    and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and you can't see them at night especially. And they have these long    to    to    ft. tentacles. And they do this wrapping. And they can send the poison into the system. And a little kid from the back was like this. And I said   What's your name    Henry.   Henry  what's your question   He said   Well  I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion.  He said   You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs   And I said   Well it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit  but yeah  I know those guys.  He said   That's what you need. You need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this.   And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish  they're going to be busy with them  and you'll just scoot around.  I said   Oh  it's like a suicide army.  He said   That's what I'm talking about. That's what you need.  And little did I know  that you should listen to eight year olds. And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal  and  no joke  this is it  it came from the shark divers. I finished the swim like this. I was swimming with this thing on. That's how scared of the jellyfish I was. So now what do I do  I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives. Because we've all had them  haven't we  We've all had a heartache. And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat. And I can look at the journey  not just the destination. I can feel proud. I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous. Yeah. Thank you. And with all sincerity  I can say  I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way  because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore  I got there with that goal. When you live that way  when you live with that kind of passion  there's no time  there's no time for regrets  you're just moving forward. And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way  swim or no swim. But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes  if cancer has won  if there's death and we have no choice  then grace and acceptance are necessary. But that ocean's still there. This hope is still alive. And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years  and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails  but I can swim from Cuba to Florida  and I will swim from Cuba to Florida. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And so  what after that  Are you going to swim the Atlantic  No  that's the last swim. It's the only swim I'm interested in. But I'm ready. And by the way  a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August   nd       and for some odd reason in Wikipedia  they had my death date too. He said   Did you know you're going to die the same place you were born  New York City  and it's going to be in January of '     I said   Nope. I didn't know.  And now I'm going to live to   . I have three more years than I thought. And so I ask myself  I'm starting to ask myself now  even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me  I'm asking myself  and maybe I can ask you tonight too  to paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver  she says   So what is it  what is it you're doing  with this one wild and precious life of yours   Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Live it large. Live it large. I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician  and that's me. And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk  let's begin with a bit of baseball. Hey  why not  We're near the end  we're getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball  don't we  Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And there's hundreds of them.  Moneyball  is about to come out  and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team. I'm going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of. It's called batting average. So we talk about a      a batter who bats    . That means that ballplayer batted safely  hit safely three times out of    at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield  it dropped  it didn't get caught  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe. Three times out of   . Do you know what they call a     hitter in Major League Baseball  Good  really good  maybe an all star. Do you know what they call a     baseball hitter  That's somebody who hit  by the way  four times safely out of every   . Legendary    as in Ted Williams legendary    the last Major League Baseball player to hit over     during a regular season. Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfortable  or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis and you're referred to a surgeon who's batting     on appendectomies. Somehow this isn't working out  is it  Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who's batting     on angioplasties. But  but  you know what  She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. And she's hitting a    . Somehow this isn't working. But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon  an OBGYN  a paramedic is supposed to be         very good. Now truth of the matter is  nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them  including myself  out into the world with the admonition  be perfect. Never ever  ever make a mistake  but you worry about the details  about how that's going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school  a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. And so I did. And I studied in my little garret at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital  not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta  differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while  I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well  I graduated with honors  cum laude. And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything  or as much as possible  as close to everything as possible  that it would immunize me against making mistakes. And it worked for a while  until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult  to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker  and she was breathless. And when I listened to her  she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward  some of the blood backs up into the lung  the lungs fill up with blood  and that's why you have shortness of breath. And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics  water pills  to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two  she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake  I sent her home. Actually  I made two more mistakes. I sent her home without speaking to my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do  which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didn't want to be a high maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me   Goldman  not a good idea. Don't do this.  In fact  so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker   Do you think it's okay if she goes home   And the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly   Yeah  I think she'll do okay.  I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers  and an ambulance came  paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day  that afternoon  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day  I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before  but another nurse  said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well  but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you sent home   the other nurse asked matter of factly.  Well she's back   in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home  after I'd sent her home  she collapsed and her family called     and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of     which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster  because after they stabilized her  she went to the intensive care unit  and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days  it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days  they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark  they let her go    Mrs. Drucker  a wife  a mother and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks  I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine    where I felt alone  isolated  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind  when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions  but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say  I'll never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says  not that what you did was bad  but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending  he was a doll. He talked to the family  and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending  Why did I send her home  And then at my worst moments  Why did I make such a stupid mistake  Why did I go into medicine  Slowly but surely  it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered  maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again  please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto  and I saw a    year old man with a sore throat. It was busy  I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat  it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door  he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words  Do you remember   Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat   Well it turns out  he didn't have a strep throat. He had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can Google it  but it's an infection  not of the throat  but of the upper airway  and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work  until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift  I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing  especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but    people a night. Now in both cases  I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X ray. When it turned out to be normal  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant  called the surgeons. In both cases  they had their operations and they did okay. But each time  they were gnawing at me  eating at me. And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say  which is total B.S. Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone  ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem  If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes  if I can't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened  how can I share it with my colleagues  How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing  If I were to walk into a room    like right now  I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure  Oh yeah  you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor  but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now  I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable  somebody would crack a joke  they'd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact  if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital  believe me  I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have. It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians    those who make mistakes and those who don't  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can  those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes. And it's almost like an ideological reaction  like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine  what will we be left with  but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my    years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show  White Coat  Black Art.  And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system where errors happen every day  where one in    medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage  where hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous  causing havoc and death. In this country  as many as        Canadians die of preventable medical errors. In the United States  the Institute of Medicine pegged it at        . In both cases  these are gross underestimates  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should. And here's the thing. In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years  we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain  make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I don't take the same history. I'm not a robot  I don't do things the same way each time. And my patients aren't cars  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that  mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system  as I was taught  and weed out all the error prone health professionals  well there won't be anybody left. And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases  On my show  on  White Coat  Black Art   I made it a habit of saying   Here's my worst mistake   I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery   Here's my worst mistake   blah  blah  blah  blah  blah   What about yours   and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate  they would recoil  then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say   Look  don't make the same mistake I did.  What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human  knows she's human  accepts it  isn't proud of making mistakes  but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other people's mistakes  not in a gotcha way  but in a loving  supportive way so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system  and when human beings run the system  they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving  supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so  and especially people like me  when we do make mistakes  we're rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that  but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people. I still don't know what you think of me  but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own  I do remember. We do not invest in victims  we invest in survivors. And in ways both big and small  the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women. You can't count what you don't see. And we don't invest in what's invisible to us. But this is the face of resilience. Six years ago  I started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict. I set out to write a compelling economic story  one that had great characters  that no one else was telling  and one that I thought mattered. And that turned out to be women. I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of    for business school  a path I knew almost nothing about. None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland had graduated from college  let alone considered business school. But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent. And I saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling. So if you're going to talk about jobs  then you have to talk about entrepreneurs. And if you're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post conflict settings  then you must talk about women  because they are the population you have left. Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was    percent female. I want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs I've met and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years. I went to Afghanistan in      to work on a Financial Times piece  and there I met Kamila  a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly        a month    an astronomical sum in that context. And she had turned it down  she said  because she was going to start her next business  an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around Afghanistan. Business  she said  was critical to her country's future. Because long after this round of internationals left  business would help keep her country peaceful and secure. And she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women. So I was amazed. I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from  The Apprentice.  So I asked her   How in the world do you know this much about business  Why are you so passionate   She said   Oh Gayle  this is actually my third business. My first business was a dressmaking business I started under the Taliban. And that was actually an excellent business  because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood. And that's really how I became an entrepreneur.  Think about this  Here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets. And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive  these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many. I couldn't leave the story  and I couldn't leave the topic either  because everywhere I went I met more of these women who no one seemed to know about  or even wish to. I went on to Bosnia  and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official who said   You know  Gayle  I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia  but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road. So maybe you could interview her.  So I went out reporting and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo. She had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage  sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the    or    family members who were counting on her for survival. By the time we met  she had    employees  most of them women  who were sending their boys and their girls to school. And she was just the start. I met women running essential oils businesses  wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency. So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover. And when this story posted  I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official. And I said   Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference  here are a couple of women.  But think about this. The IMF official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro. The biases  whether intentional or otherwise  are pervasive  and so are the misleading mental images. If you see the word  microfinance   what comes to mind  Most people say women. And if you see the word  entrepreneur   most people think men. Why is that  Because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women. Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self sufficiency and self respect  but we must move beyond micro hopes and micro ambitions for women  because they have so much greater hopes for themselves. They want to move from micro to medium and beyond. And in many places  they're there. In the U.S.  women owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by     . In South Korea and Indonesia  women own nearly half a million firms. China  women run    percent of all small businesses. And in the developing world overall  That figure is    to    percent. Nearly everywhere I go  I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance  access to markets and established business networks. They are often ignored because they're harder to help. It is much riskier to give a        dollar loan than it is to give a     dollar loan. And as the World Bank recently noted  women are stuck in a productivity trap. Those in small businesses can't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can't grow out of them. Recently I was at the State Department in Washington and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana. She sells chocolates. And she had come to Washington  not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan. She had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to Africa  Europe  the Middle East and far beyond    capital that would help her to employ more than the    people that she already has working for her  and capital that would fuel her own country's economic climb. The great news is we already know what works. Theory and empirical evidence Have already taught us. We don't need to invent solutions because we have them    cash flow loans based in income rather than assets  loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral  because women often don't own land. And Kiva.org  the microlender  is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans. And that's just to start. Recently it has become very much in fashion to call women  the emerging market of the emerging market.  I think that is terrific. You know why  Because    and I say this as somebody who worked in finance        billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade. Because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth  and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets. How wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest     billion dollars unleashing women's economic potential  Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs  productivity  employment  child nutrition  maternal mortality  literacy and much  much more. Because  as the World Economic Forum noted  smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness. And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap    not one. So the great news is this is an incredible opportunity. We have so much room to grow. So you see  this is not about doing good  this is about global growth and global employment. It is about how we invest and it's about how we see women. And women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group. Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me   Gayle  these are great stories  but you're really writing about the exceptions.  Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons. First of all  for exceptions  there are a lot of them and they're important. Secondly  when we talk about men who are succeeding  we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated. And when we talk about women  they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored. And finally  there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional. So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them  This topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life. My mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold Tupperware at night so that I could have every opportunity possible. We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores  and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work  we even applied for food stamps. And when I would feel sorry for myself as nine or    year old girls do  she would say to me   My dear  on a scale of major world tragedies  yours is not a three.  And when I was applying to business school and felt certain I couldn't do it and nobody I knew had done it  I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact. And she told me   Never import other people's limitations.  And when I complained to my grandmother  a World War II veteran who worked in film for    years and who supported me from the age of     that I was terrified that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC for a fellowship overseas  I would never ever  ever find another job  she said   Kiddo  I'm going to tell you two things. First of all  no one turns down a Fulbright  and secondly  McDonald's is always hiring.   You will find a job. Take the leap.  The women in my family are not exceptions. The women in this room and watching in L.A. and all around the world are not exceptions. We are not a special interest group. We are the majority. And for far too long  we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others. It is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women  to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world. We can make a difference  and make a difference  not just for women  but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions. Together we can make certain that the so called exceptions begin to rule. When we change the way we see ourselves  others will follow. And it is time for all of us to think bigger. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you about  or share with you  a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse. We're talking about a pick  pack and ship setting here. So as a hint  this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots  sometimes thousands of mobile robots  moving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution. But for a moment  just think about the last time that you ordered something online. You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t shirt. So   click    you put it into your shopping cart. And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too   click  And maybe a blue pair of shoes   click  So at this point you've assembled your order. You didn't stop to think  for a moment that that might not be a great outfit. But you hit  submit order.  And two days later  this package shows up on your doorstep. And you open the box and you're like  wow  there's my goo. Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse  So I'm here to tell you  it's that guy right there. So deep in the middle of that picture  you see a classic pick pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting. Classically these pick workers will  spend    or    percent of their day wandering around the warehouse. They'll often walk as much as   or    miles in pursuit of those items of inventory. Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders  it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders. So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem. I was out in the Bay area  in '          the dot com boom. I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame out called Webvan. This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online. And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively. Turns out e commerce was something that was very hard and very costly. In this particular instance we were trying to assemble    items of inventory into a few totes  onto a van to deliver to the home. And when you think about it  it was costing us    dollars. Imagine  we had an     can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote. And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home. So long story short  during my one year at Webvan  what I realized by talking to  all the material handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking. Red item  green  blue  getting those three things in a box. So we said  there's just got to be a better way to do this. Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores. Of course Webvan went out of business  and about a year and a half later  I was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me. And I started thinking about it again. And I said  let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker  or my vision for how it should work. I said  let's focus on the problem. I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red  green and blue in this box right here. What I need is a system where I put out my hand and   poof    the product shows up  and I pack it into the order  and now we're thinking  this would be a very operator centric approach to solving the problem. This is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem  But as you can see  orders can come and go  products can come and go. It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem  and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible. So how did I arrive at this notion  Well  actually it came from a brainstorming exercise  probably a technique that many of you use  It's this notion of testing your ideas. Take a blank sheet  of course  but then test your ideas at the limits   infinity  zero. In this particular case  we challenged ourselves with the idea  What if we had to build a distribution center in China  where it's a very  very low cost market  And say  labor is cheap  land is cheap. And we said specifically   What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million  square foot distribution center   So naturally that led to ideas that said   Let's put lots of people in the warehouse.  And I said   Hold on  zero dollars per hour  what I would do is 'hire'        workers to come to the warehouse every morning at   a.m.  walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there. So you hold Captain Crunch  you hold the Mountain Dew  you hold the Diet Coke. If I need it  I'll call you  otherwise just stand there. But when I need Diet Coke and I call it  you guys talk amongst yourselves. Diet Coke walks up to the front   pick it  put it in the tote  away it goes.  Wow  what if the products could walk and talk on their own  That's a very interesting  very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse. So of course  labor isn't free  on that practical versus awesome spectrum. So we said mobile shelving   We'll put them on mobile shelving. We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around. And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in     . Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics  the opening ceremonies  I about fell out of my couch when I saw this. I'm like  that was the idea  We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor  the stadium floor. But interestingly enough  this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful  impressive digital art  all without computers  I'm told  it was all peer to peer coordination and communication. You stand up  I'll squat down. And they made some fabulous art. It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other. So that was a little bit of the journey. So of course  now what became the practical reality of this idea  Here is a warehouse. It's a pick  pack and ship center that has about        different SKUs. We'll call them red pens  green pens  yellow Post It Notes. We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods. And we deliver them to the side of the building. So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter. And the game here is to pick up the shelves  take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker. This pick worker's life is completely different. Rather than wandering around the warehouse  she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her. So the process is very productive. Reach in  pick an item  scan the bar code  pack it out. By the time you turn around  there's another product there ready to be picked and packed. So what we've done is take out all of the non value added walking  searching  wasting  waited time  and we've developed a very  high fidelity way to pick these orders  where you point at it with a laser  scan the UPC barcode  and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into. So more productive  more accurate and  it turns out  it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers. They actually complete the whole order. So they do red  green and blue  not just a part of the order. And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment. So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us. We knew it was going  to be more productive. But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse. But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine. So this is again a cross fertilization of ideas. Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures. The notion here is that you have    workers on  the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers. If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom  it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers. Contrast that  for a moment  with the traditional method of using a conveyor. When one person passes the order to you  you put something in and pass it downstream. Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work. This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse. And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking the popularity of the products. And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse. So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day. All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations. Come in two days after Valentine's Day  and that candy  the leftover candy  has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there. One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous. So whether you're doing two pick stations     pick stations  or     pick stations  the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work. In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were. They sorted it out for themselves. So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of. So as we mentioned  the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations. And our software in the background understands what's going on  in each station  we direct the pods across the highway and we're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker. What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers. The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few. But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before. She puts out her hand. The product jumps into it. Or she has to reach in and get it. She scans it and  she puts it in the bucket. And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes. So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job. Never has any idle time  never has to leave her mat. And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders. We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders. The reason we can say that  though  is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day. And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as  they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren  or in one case a guy said   the Kiva zone is so stress free that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication.  That was at a pharmaceutical distributor  so they told us not to use that video. So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own  interesting processes and productivities can emerge. And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online  you break it open and the goo is in there  you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order. Thank you. As the highest military commander of the Netherlands  with troops stationed around the world  I'm really honored to be here today. When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue  I see a very special audience. You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today. When I look around  I see people who want to make a contribution. I see people who want to make a better world  by doing groundbreaking scientific work  by creating impressive works of art  by writing critical articles or inspiring books  by starting up sustainable businesses. And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world. Some chose the microscope as their instrument. Others chose dancing or painting  or making music like we just heard. Some chose the pen. Others work through the instrument of money. Ladies and gentlemen  I made a different choice. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen ... I share your goals. I share the goals of the speakers you heard before. I did not choose to take up the pen  the brush  the camera. I chose this instrument. I chose the gun. For you  and you heard already  being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy. It may even feel scary. A real gun at a few feet's distance. Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness. You could even hear it. Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun. It means the Netherlands is a peaceful country. The Netherlands is not at war. It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets. Guns are not a part of our lives. In many countries  it is a different story. In many countries  people are confronted with guns. They are oppressed. They are intimidated    by warlords  by terrorists  by criminals. Weapons can do a lot of harm. They are the cause of much distress. Why then am I standing before you with this weapon  Why did I choose the gun as my instrument  Today I want to tell you why. Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world. And I want to tell you how this gun can help. My story starts in the city of Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands  the city where I was born. My father was a hardworking baker  but when he had finished work in the bakery  he often told me and my brother stories. And most of the time  he told me this story I'm going to share with you now. The story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands. Their grim plans were evident. They meant to rule by means of repression. Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans. Only brute force remained. It was our last resort. My father was there to provide it. As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt  my father was an excellent marksman. When he aimed  he never missed. At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen. He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country  his country  our country. He fired. Nothing happened. He fired again. No German soldier fell to the ground. My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank. Hitler's troops marched on  and there was nothing my father could do about it. Until the day my father died  he was frustrated about missing these shots. He could have done something. But with an old gun  not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark. So this story stayed with me. Then in high school  I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers    soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn't know. They liberated my birth town. It was then that I decided I would take up the gun    out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us. From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil. And that is why I took up the gun    not to shoot  not to kill  not to destroy  but to stop those who would do evil  to protect the vulnerable  to defend democratic values  to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place. Ladies and gentlemen  I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons. I do not like guns. And once you have been under fire yourself  it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about. I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world. Now this may sound contradictory to you. But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon  Sarajevo and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence  this is also supported by cold  hard statistics. Violence has declined dramatically over the last     years. Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news  wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace. The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of    since the Middle Ages. And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War. Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era. Why  Why has violence decreased  Has the human mind changed  Well  we were talking about the human mind this morning. Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge  for violent rituals  for pure rage  Or is there something else  In his latest book  Harvard professor Steven Pinker    and many other thinkers before him    concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction  on a large scale  of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence    legitimized by a democratically elected government  legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system. In other words  a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control. Such a state monopoly on violence  first of all  serves as a reassurance. It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies. Secondly  the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further. Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war. Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel. It enhances peace even further. Where there is no conflict  trade flourishes. And trade is another important incentive against violence. With trade  there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties. And when there is mutual gain  both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war. War is simply no longer the best option  and that is why violence has decreased. This  ladies and gentlemen  is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces. The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence. We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so. It is this legitimate  controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to reducing the statistics of war  conflict and violence around the globe. It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars. My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace. And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous. Failed states have no legitimized  democratically controlled use of force. Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability. That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict. That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions. That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan. That is why we train police officers  we train judges  we train public prosecutors around the world. And that is why    and in the Netherlands  we are very unique in that    that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen  looking at this gun  we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind. Every day I hope that politicians  diplomats  development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope. And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression. But until that day comes  we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle. Until that day comes  I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun. I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us. I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg  when she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan. Ladies and gentlemen  until the day comes when we can do away with the gun  I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge. It takes hard work  often behind the scenes. It takes good equipment and well trained  dedicated soldiers. I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun  instead of the bad gun my father was given. I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there  when they come home and when they are injured and need our care. They put their lives on the line  for us  for you  and we cannot let them down. I hope you will respect my soldiers  this soldier with this gun. Because she wants a better world. Because she makes an active contribution to a better world  just like all of us here today. Thank you very much. Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer    if not personally  then through a loved one  a family member  colleague  friend. And once our lives are touched by cancer  we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons  or three tools  that are available to fight the disease  surgery  radiation and chemotherapy. And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions  again either personally or with our loved ones and family members  we also very quickly learn the benefits  the trade offs and the limitations of these tools. I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark and the TEDMED team for inviting me today to describe a fourth tool  a new tool  that we call Tumor Treating Fields. Tumor Treating Fields were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti  professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel. And they use low intensity electric fields to fight cancer. To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work  we first need to understand what are electric fields. Let me first address a few popular misconceptions. First of all  electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue. Electric fields are not ionizing radiation  like X rays or proton beams  that bombard tissue to disrupt DNA. And electric fields are not magnetism. What electric fields are are a field of forces. And these forces act on  attract  bodies that have an electrical charge. The best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity. Gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses. We can all picture astronauts in space. They float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them. But as that space shuttle returns to Earth  and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field  they begin to see the effects of gravity. They begin to be attracted towards Earth. And as they land  they're fully aligned in the gravitational field. We're  of course  all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now. That's why you're all in your chairs. And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up  to walk around and to lift things. In cancer  cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth. We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station. And in that space station we have the genetic material  the chromosomes  within a nucleus. And out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions. Importantly  those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body. As cell division begins the nucleus disintegrates  the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special proteins undergo a three dimensional sequence whereby they attach and they literally click into place end on end to form chains. These chains then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells. And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells  two cancer cells become four cancer cells  and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth. Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station. And when that cellular space station is within the electric field  it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them. And it prevents them from forming those chains  those mitotic spindles  that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells. What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours. And they will either enter into this so called cellular suicide  programmed cell death  or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided. And we can observe this. What I'm going to show you next are two in vitro experiments. This is cultures  identical cultures  of cervical cancer cells. And we've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains. The first clip shows a normal cell division without the Tumor Treating Fields. What we see are  first of all  a very active culture  a lot of divisions  and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated. And we can see them dividing throughout. When we apply the fields    again  in the identical time scale to the identical culture    you're going to see something different. The cells round up for division  but they're very static in that position. We'll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide. The one within the circle manages. But see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus  even in the dividing cell. The one up there can't divide at all. And then this bubbling  this membrane bubbling  is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell. Formation of healthy mitotic spindles is necessary for division in all cell types. We've applied Tumor Treating Fields to over    different cancers in the lab  and we see this effect in all of them. Now importantly  these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect on normal undividing cells.    years ago  Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients. In that time  Novocure's developed two systems    one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body. The first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer  GBM. GBM affects about        people in the U.S. each year. It's a death sentence. The expected five year survival is less than five percent. And the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year  and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again. Novocure conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent GBM. So these are patients who had received surgery  high dose radiation to the head and first line chemotherapy  and that had failed and their tumors had grown back. We divided the patients into two groups. The first group received second line chemotherapy  which is expected to double the life expectancy  versus no treatment at all. And then the second group received only Tumor Treating Field therapy. What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups    so the chemotherapy treated group and the Tumor Treating Field group    was the same. But importantly  the Tumor Treating Field group suffered none of the side effects typical of chemotherapy patients. They had no pain  suffered none of the infections. They had no nausea  diarrhea  constipation  fatigue that would be expected. Based on this trial  in April of this year  the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. Importantly  it was the first time ever that the FDA included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim. So I'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial. Robert Dill Bundi is a famous Swiss cycling champion. He won the gold medal in Moscow in the       meter pursuit. And five years ago  Robert was diagnosed with GBM. He received the standard treatments. He received surgery. He received high dose radiation to the head. And he received first line chemotherapy. A year after this treatment    in fact  this is his baseline MRI. You can see that the black regions in the upper right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery. And a year after that treatment  his tumor grew back with a vengeance. That cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor. At this point  he was told by his doctors that he had about   months to live. He entered our trial. And here we can see him getting the therapy. First of all  these electrodes are noninvasive. They're attached to the skin in the area of the tumor. Here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages. The patients learn to do this themselves And then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life. There's none of the tiredness. There's none of what is called the  chemo head.  There's no sensation. It doesn't interfere with computers or electrical equipment. And the therapy is delivered continuously at home  without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually. These are Robert's MRIs  again  under only TTField treatment. This is a therapy that takes time to work. It's a medical device  it works when it's on. But what we can see is  by month six  the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away. It's still there. By month     we could argue whether there's a little bit of material around the edges  but it's essentially completely gone. It's now five years since Robert's diagnosis  and he's alive  but importantly  he's healthy and he's at work. I'm going to let him  in this very short clip  describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words. I rate what I have today a bit different than what most people would assume. I am the happiest  the happiest person in the world. And every single morning I appreciate life. Every night I fall asleep very well  and I am  I repeat  the happiest man in the world  and I'm thankful I am alive. BD  Novocure's also working on lung cancer as the second target. We've run a phase two trial in Switzerland on  again  recurrent patients    patients who have received standard therapy and whose cancer has come back. I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia. Lydia's a    year old farmer in Switzerland. She was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago. She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years  none of which had an effect. Her cancer continued to grow. Three years ago  she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial. You can see  in her case  she's wearing her transducer arrays  one of the front of her chest  one on the back  and then the second pair side to side over the liver. You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator  but importantly you can also see that she is living her life. She is managing her farm. She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids. And when we talked to her  she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy  she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions. Her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went. Now she can run all of the activities of her farm. It's only the beginning. In the lab  we've observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields. There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit. We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self repair mechanisms that we have. There's now a new research project underway at the Karolinska in Sweden to prove that hypothesis. We have more trials planned for lung cancer  pancreatic cancer  ovarian cancer and breast cancer. And I firmly believe that in the next    years Tumor Treating Fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these most difficult to treat solid tumors. I'm also very hopeful that in the next decades  we will make big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease. Thank you. When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old  we were playing on top of a bunk bed. I was two years older than my sister at the time    I mean  I'm two years older than her now    but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do  and I wanted to play war. So we were up on top of our bunk beds. And on one side of the bunk bed  I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry. And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge. There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon  but since my sister is not here with us today  let me tell you the true story    which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side. Somehow  without any help or push from her older brother at all  Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground. I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible. And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before    heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet  for which I have yet to be thanked  I was trying as hard as I could    she didn't even see it coming    I was trying hard to be on my best behavior. And I saw my sister's face  this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled. So I did the only thing my frantic seven year old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy. And if you have children  you've seen this hundreds of times. I said   Amy  wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed  No human lands on all fours like that. Amy  I think this means you're a unicorn.  Now  that was cheating  because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year old little sister  but Amy the special unicorn. Of course  this option was open to her brain at no point in the past. And you could see how my poor  manipulated sister faced conflict  as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced  or contemplating her new found identity as a unicorn. And the latter won. Instead of crying or ceasing our play  instead of waking my parents  with all the negative consequences for me  a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn    with one broken leg. What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven    we had no idea at the time    was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. We had stumbled across something called positive psychology  which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning. When I started talking about this research outside of academia  with companies and schools  the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph. The first thing I want to do is start with a graph. This graph looks boring  but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning. And this graph doesn't even mean anything  it's fake data. What we found is    If I got this data studying you  I would be thrilled  because there's a trend there  and that means that I can get published  which is all that really matters. There is one weird red dot above the curve  there's one weirdo in the room    I know who you are  I saw you earlier    that's no problem. That's no problem  as most of you know  because I can just delete that dot. I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error. And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data. So one of the first things we teach people in economics  statistics  business and psychology courses is how  in a statistically valid way  do we eliminate the weirdos. How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit  Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking    two. But if I'm interested in your potential  or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity  we're creating the cult of the average with science. If I asked a question like   How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom   scientists change the answer to  How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom   and we tailor the class towards the average. If you fall below the average  then psychologists get thrilled  because that means you're depressed or have a disorder  or hopefully both. We're hoping for both because our business model is  if you come into a therapy session with one problem  we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten  so you keep coming back. We'll go back into your childhood if necessary  but eventually we want to make you normal again. But normal is merely average. And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average  we will remain merely average. Then instead of deleting those positive outliers  what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say  why  Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual  athletic  musical ability  creativity  energy levels  resiliency in the face of challenge  sense of humor  Whatever it is  instead of deleting you  what I want to do is study you. Because maybe we can glean information  not just how to move people up to the average  but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide. The reason this graph is important to me is  on the news  the majority of the information is not positive. in fact it's negative. Most of it's about murder  corruption  diseases  natural disasters. And very quickly  my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world. This creates  the medical school syndrome.  During the first year of medical training  as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases  suddenly you realize you have all of them. I have a brother in law named Bobo  which is a whole other story. Bobo married Amy the unicorn. Bobo called me on the phone    from Yale Medical School  and Bobo said   Shawn  I have leprosy.  Which  even at Yale  is extraordinarily rare. But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause. We're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us  but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. And if we can change the lens  not only can we change your happiness  we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time. I applied to Harvard on a dare. I didn't expect to get in  and my family had no money for college. When I got a military scholarship two weeks later  they let me go. Something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality. I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well  that they'd be excited to be there. Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you  I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom. But what I found is  while some people experience that  when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students    Harvard asked me to  I wasn't that guy. I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years. And in my research and my teaching  I found that these students  no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school  two weeks later their brains were focused  not on the privilege of being there  nor on their philosophy or physics  but on the competition  the workload  the hassles  stresses  complaints. When I first went in there  I walked into the freshmen dining hall  which is where my friends from Waco  Texas  which is where I grew up    I know some of you know this. When they'd visit  they'd look around  and say   This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's.  It does  because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard. And when they see this  they say   Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard  What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about   Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness. Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels  when in reality  if I know everything about your external world  I can only predict     of your long term happiness.    percent of your long term happiness is predicted not by the external world  but by the way your brain processes the world. And if we change it  if we change our formula for happiness and success  we can change the way that we can then affect reality. What we found is that only     of job successes are predicted by IQ     percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels  your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat. I talked to a New England boarding school  probably the most prestigious one  and they said   We already know that. So every year  instead of just teaching our students  we have a wellness week. And we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression. Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying. Wednesday night is eating disorders. Thursday night is illicit drug use. And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness.  I said   That's most people's Friday nights.  Which I'm glad you liked  but they did not like that at all. Silence on the phone. And into the silence  I said   I'd be happy to speak at your school  but that's not a wellness week  that's a sickness week. You've outlined all the negative things that can happen  but not talked about the positive.  The absence of disease is not health. Here's how we get to health  We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. In the last three years  I've traveled to    countries  working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn. And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success  which is this  If I work harder  I'll be more successful. And if I'm more successful  then I'll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles  the way that we motivate our behavior. And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. Every time your brain has a success  you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. You got good grades  now you have to get better grades  you got into a good school and after you get into a better one  you got a good job  now you have to get a better job  you hit your sales target  we're going to change it. And if happiness is on the opposite side of success  your brain never gets there. We've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon  as a society. And that's because we think we have to be successful  then we'll be happier. But our brains work in the opposite order. If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present  then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage  which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative  neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises  your creativity rises  your energy levels rise. In fact  we've found that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is     more productive than your brain at negative  neutral or stressed. You're     better at sales. Doctors are    percent faster  more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative  neutral or stressed. Which means we can reverse the formula. If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present  then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder  faster and more intelligently. We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. Because dopamine  which floods into your system when you're positive  has two functions. Not only does it make you happier  it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way. We've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive. In just a two minute span of time done for    days in a row  we can actually rewire your brain  allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. We've done these things in research now in every company that I've worked with  getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for    days in a row  three new things each day. And at the end of that  their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative  but for the positive first. Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past    hours allows your brain to relive it. Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. And finally  random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. We get people  when they open up their inbox  to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network. And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies  what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success  and in doing so  not only create ripples of positivity  but a real revolution. Thank you very much. I'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings. I study health systems in these countries. And one of the major gaps in care  almost across the board  is access to safe surgery. Now one of the major bottlenecks that we've found that's sort of preventing both the access in the first place and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia. And actually  it's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments. Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country. In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine. And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind. In order to operate  this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer. It needs an extremely well trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery. It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms  and it needs special care  TLC  to keep it up and running  and it's going to break pretty easily. And when it does  it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities  can fix it  can source the parts and keep it saving lives. It's a pretty expensive machine. It needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of    or         . And perhaps most obviously  and perhaps most importantly    and the path to concepts that we've heard about kind of illustrate this    it needs infrastructure that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity  of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine. In other words  this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital cannot offer. This is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural Malawi. In this hospital  there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia  and she's qualified because she has     maybe    months of training in anesthesia. In the hospital and in the entire region there's not a single biomedical engineer. So when this machine breaks  the machines they have to work with break  they've got to try and figure it out  but most of the time  that's the end of the road. Those machines go the proverbial junkyard. And the price tag of the machine that I mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital. And finally  I think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong. This hospital is connected to a very weak power grid  one that goes down frequently. So it runs frequently  the entire hospital  just on a generator. And you can imagine  the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel. And the World Bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low income country can expect up to    power outages per month. Similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year. So it seems crazy  but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that I showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment. It's not just inappropriate  it becomes really unsafe. One of our partners at Johns Hopkins was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone about a year ago. And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case. A woman came in  she needed an emergency C section to save her life and the life of her baby. And everything began pretty auspiciously. The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in. The nurse was there. She was able to anesthetize her quickly  and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation. And everything began well until the power went out. And now in the middle of this surgery  the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case  which he can do    he's got a headlamp. But the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient  to keep her patient asleep. Because her machine doesn't work when there's no power. And now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced  and others are probably the product of  has now become a tragedy. And what's so frustrating is this is not a singular event  this happens across the developing world.    million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia. My colleague  Dr. Paul Fenton  was living this reality. He was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in Malawi  a teaching hospital. He went to work every day in an operating theater like this one  trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable  and frankly unsafe  in his hospital. And after umpteen surgeries and  you can imagine  really unspeakable tragedy  he just said   That's it. I'm done. That's enough. There has to be something better.  So he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them    I think that's the scientific term    and he just started tinkering. He took one part from here and another from there  and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing. And what he came up with was this guy  the prototype for the Universal Anesthesia Machine    a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer. Here it is back at home at that same hospital  developed a little further     years later  working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics. Now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works. Voila  Here she is. When you have electricity  everything in this machine begins in the base. There's a built in oxygen concentrator down there. Now you've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point. Essentially  to deliver anesthesia  you want as pure oxygen as possible  because eventually you're going to dilute it essentially with the gas. And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous. But so in here when there's electricity  the oxygen concentrator takes in room air. Now we know room air is gloriously free  it is abundant  and it's already    percent oxygen. So all this concentrator does is take that room air in  filter it and send    percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent. Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs  it's going to pass by here    you can't see it  but there's an oxygen sensor here    that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered. Now if you don't have power  or  God forbid  the power cuts out in the middle of surgery  this machine transitions automatically  without even having to touch it  to drawing in room air from this inlet. Everything else is the same. The only difference is that now you're only working with    percent oxygen. Now that used to be a dangerous guessing game  because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened. But we've put a long life battery backup on here. This is the only part that's battery backed up. But this gives control to the provider  whether there's power or not  because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient. In both cases  whether you have power or not  sometimes the patient needs help breathing. It's just a reality of anesthesia. The lungs can be paralyzed. And so we've just added this manual bellows. We've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this. So it's a straightforward machine. I shudder to say simple  it's straightforward. And it's by design. And you do not need to be a highly trained  specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine  which is good because  in these rural district hospitals  you're not going to get that level of training. It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in. This is an incredibly rugged machine. It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts. And so it's not going to break very easily  but if it does  virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver. And finally  it's affordable. This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier. So in other words  what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment  just like the first machine I showed you. But we're not content to stop there. Is it working  Is this the design that's going to work in place  Well we've seen good results so far. This is in    hospitals in four countries  and since       we've done well over       surgeries with no clinically adverse events. So we're thrilled. This really seems like a cost effective  scalable solution to a problem that's really pervasive. But we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals. So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface  on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself. One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore. They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore. So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for  and in a contained  safe environment  evaluating its effectiveness. We're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience  because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone  including the hospital where that emergency C section happened. So I've talked a lot about anesthesia  and I tend to do that. I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health. And it really seems peripheral  we never think about it  until we don't have access to it  and then it becomes a gatekeeper. Who gets surgery and who doesn't  Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't  But you know  it's just one of so many ways that design  appropriate design  can have an impact on health outcomes. If more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low income countries could start their design process  their solution search  from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital    in other words  if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world  rather than the one that we wished existed    we might just save a lot of lives. Thank you very much. Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be  and I thought that  since I was among friends here  I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide. And then  so if you can just turn on the slide that's on. This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file. What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide  but the general form of it. This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks. And the interesting thing about it is that this slide  like so many technology slides that we're used to  is a sort of a straight line on a semi log curve. In other words  every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale. And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi log curves. Something really weird is going on here. And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. So  if you could bring up the lights. If you could bring up the lights higher  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here. Now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves  Well the answer is  if I drew it on a normal curve where  let's say  this is years  this is time of some sort  and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph  the graphs look sort of silly. They sort of go like this. And they don't tell us much. Now if I graph  for instance  some other technology  say transportation technology  on a semi log curve  it would look very stupid  it would look like a flat line. But when something like this happens  things are qualitatively changing. So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology  then the day after tomorrow  I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in    seconds. It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. Now the question that I'd like to ask is  if you look at these exponential curves  they don't go on forever. Things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are. One of two things is going to happen. Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S curve like this  until something totally different comes along  or maybe it's going to do this. That's about all it can do. Now I'm an optimist  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that. If so  that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition. We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is. And so what I'm trying to ask  what I've been asking myself  is what's this new way that the world is  What's that new state that the world is heading toward  Because the transition seems very  very confusing when we're right in the middle of it. Now when I was a kid growing up  the future was kind of the year       and people used to talk about what would happen in the year     . Now here's a conference in which people talk about the future  and you notice that the future is still at about the year     . It's about as far as we go out. So in other words  the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime. Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something's happening there. That transition is happening. We can all sense it. And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out        years because everything's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all. So what I would like to talk about is what that could be  what that transition could be that we're going through. Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers. Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things. So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth. So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time. So if you go back about two and a half billion years  the Earth was this big  sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it. And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it  which is that  at that time  there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them. And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil. And those that were like that started to split and divide. And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense  those little drops of oil. But now those drops of oil weren't really alive  as we say it now  because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals. And every time it divided  they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them. And so every drop was a little bit different. In fact  the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more. So those tended to live longer  get expressed more. Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life  but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction. Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand  these little drops learned to write down information. They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA. So in other words  they worked out  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way  a form of writing that let them write down what they were  so that that way of writing it down could get copied. The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. In fact the recipe for us  our genes  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. In fact  every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. In fact  one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code. And I've got here a little     micrograms of white powder  which I try not to let the security people see at airports. But this has in it    what I did is I took this code    the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it    and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it    to the    times. So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card  I have plenty for everyone in the room  and  in fact  everyone in the world  and it's right here. If I had really been a egotist  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. So what was the next step  Writing down the DNA was an interesting step. And that caused these cells    that kept them happy for another billion years. But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information  so that they began to get communities of cells. I don't know if you know this  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. Now that's why  for instance  antibiotic resistance has evolved. Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin  because bacteria communicate. Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that  in some sense  were in the same boat together  they were synergistic. So they survived or they failed together  which means that if a community was very successful  all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution. Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that  in fact  they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA. And so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years. And at that stage  we have multi cellular communities  communities of lots of different types of cells  working together as a single organism. And in fact  we're such a multi cellular community. We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore. Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell  muscle cell  a brain cell and so on. So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell  but a community which we call an organism. Now the next step that happened is within these communities. These communities of cells  again  began to abstract information. And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community. And those are the neural structures. So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up. And in fact  they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording  understanding  learning information. And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities. And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. Because at that point  an individual    learning could happen within the time span of a single organism  instead of over this evolutionary time span. So an organism could  for instance  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it. That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit. So that nervous system  the fact that they built these special information structures  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution. Because evolution could now happen within an individual. It could happen in learning time scales. But then what happened was the individuals worked out  of course  tricks of communicating. And for example  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. Here I have a very complicated  messy  confused idea in my head. I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically  and hopefully constructing a similar messy  confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it. But we're taking something very complicated  turning it into sound  sequences of sounds  and producing something very complicated in your brain. So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism. And so  in fact  what we've done is we  humanity  have started abstracting out. We're going through the same levels that multi cellular organisms have gone through    abstracting out our methods of recording  presenting  processing information. So for example  the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction. Telephony  computers  videotapes  CD ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information. And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before. So now  evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds. And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes. So now we've speeded up the time scales once again. So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece. And the next steps  like nervous systems and brains  took a few hundred million years. Then the next steps  like language and so on  took less than a million years. And these next steps  like electronics  seem to be taking only a few decades. The process is feeding on itself and becoming  I guess  autocatalytic is the word for it    when something reinforces its rate of change. The more it changes  the faster it changes. And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve. We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. Now I design computers for a living  and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers. So right now  what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense. I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. There are billions of them. Instead  what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do  much farther and faster than we could ever do. And in fact  sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand. One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot lately is evolution itself. So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale. So for example  in the most extreme cases  we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions. Say   Computer  would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions. Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions  run all of those programs  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.  So in other words  I define what I wanted. Let's say I want to sort numbers  as a simple example I've done it with. So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. So of course  random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers  so none of them will really do it. But one of them  by luck  may put two numbers in the right order. And I say   Computer  would you please now take the    percent of those random sequences that did the best job. Save those. Kill off the rest. And now let's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best. And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex.  Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. So I've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job. Say   Please repeat that process.  Score them again. Introduce some mutations perhaps. And try that again and do that for another generation. Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds. So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes  or in the complicated cases  in a few hours. At the end of that  I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers. In fact  they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand. Now if I look at those programs  I can't tell you how they work. I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work. They're obscure  weird programs. But they do the job. And in fact  I know  I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job. In fact  their life depended on doing the job. I was riding in a     with Marvin Minsky once  and he pulls out this card and says   Oh look. Look at this. It says  'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident   In fact  we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated. So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering. And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce. And yet  we don't quite understand the options of it. So in a sense  it's getting ahead of us. We're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster. So it's feeding back on itself. The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing. Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. We're taking off. And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms. So we're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. We're right at that point of transition. But I think that there really is something coming along after us. I think it's very haughty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution. And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is. So lunch is coming along  and I think I will stop at that point  before I get selected out. I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age. I grew up in Mobile  Alabama    somebody's got to be from Mobile  right     and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers  forming this beautiful delta. And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes  birds of every flavor. It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in    if you're a kid interested in animals  to grow up in. And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay  and finally into the Gulf of Mexico. And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six. I was in the gulf  and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom. And I reached down and picked him up  and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility. It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand. It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature. Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors  just pulsing all of these colors. And as I looked at it  it kind of tucked its arms under it  raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes. I'm going   My gosh   I had never seen anything like this in my life  So I marveled for a moment  and then decided it was time to release him  so I put him down. The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing  It landed on the bottom in the rubble and    fwoosh     vanished right before my eyes. And I knew  right then  at age six  that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did. And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology  and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii. And while a student at Hawaii  I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium. And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays  and being the spineless guy  I thought  well I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in  and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. Now  the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at  but they didn't really interact with people. But the octopus did. If you walked up to an octopus tank  especially early in the morning before anyone arrived  the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking   Is that guy really looking at me  He is looking at me   And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities  Some of them would hold their ground  others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks  and one in particular  this amazing animal ... I went up to the front of the tank  and he's just staring at me  and he had little horns come up above his eyes. So I went right up to the front of the tank    I was three or four inches from the front glass    and the octopus was sitting on a perch  a little rock  and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass. So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away  and at that time I could actually focus that close  now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone. Anyway  there we were  staring at each other  and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system  and    chk chk chk chk chk     this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down. He reaches up  takes another armful of gravel  releases it    chk chk chk chk chk     same thing. Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm. Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm. And then I realize the octopus won the arms race  because I was out and he had six left.  Laughter  But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing  which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate. So  about three years into my degree  a funny thing happened on the way to the office  which actually changed the course of my life. A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story  but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him  and as we left  he gave us two    millimeter movie cameras. He said   Make a movie about this expedition.   OK  a couple of biologists making a movie    this'll be interesting   and off we went. And we did  we made a movie  which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making  but it was a blast. I had so much fun. And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head  thinking   Wait a minute. Maybe I can do this all the time. Yeah  I'll be a filmmaker.  So I literally came back from that job  quit school  hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing. It's been a good ride. And what I learned in school though was really beneficial. If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals  especially behavior  it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are  how they work and  you know  a bit about their behaviors. But where I really learned about octopus was in the field  as a filmmaker making films with them  where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals  seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes. I remember I took a trip to Australia  went to an island called One Tree Island. And apparently  evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree  between the time they named it and the time I arrived  because I'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there. Anyway  one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef. In fact  there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth  twice a day  pretty rapidly. And there's a beautiful reef  very complex reef  with lots of animals  including a lot of octopus. And not uniquely but certainly  the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage. As a matter of fact  there's one right there. So our first challenge was to find these things  and that was a challenge  indeed. But the idea is  we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them. So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could  every day a little closer  a little closer  a little closer. And you knew what the limit was  they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up  come back in a few hours. And after the first week  they ignored us. It was like   I don't know what that thing is  but he's no threat to me.  So they went on about their business and from a foot away  we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience. And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember  or at least visually  was a foraging behavior. And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging  but this particular one used vision. And they would see a coral head  maybe    feet away  and start moving over toward that coral head. And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it  or imagined that one might be  but whatever the case  they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head  and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head  and they would fish out  swim for crabs. And as soon as the crabs touched the arm  it was lights out. And I always wondered what happened under that web. So we created a way to find out   Laughter  and I got my first look at that famous beak in action. It was fantastic. If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals  you might as well pick one that's fairly common. And octopus are  they live in all the oceans. They also live deep. And I can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep  but whatever the case  I like that. It's like nothing you've ever done. If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen  and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen  get in a sub. You climb in  seal the hatch  turn on a little oxygen  turn on the scrubber  which removes the CO  in the air you breathe  and they chuck you overboard. Down you go. There's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio. And as you go down  the washing machine at the surface calms down. And it gets quiet. And it starts getting really nice. And as you go deeper  that lovely  blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue. And finally  it's a rich lavender  and after a couple of thousand feet  it's ink black. And now you've entered the realm of the mid water community. You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid water. Suffice to say though  as far as I'm concerned  without question  the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid water community. But we're just going to zip right past this area  this area that includes about    percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid ocean ridge  which I think is even more extraordinary. The mid ocean ridge is a huge mountain range         miles long  snaking around the entire globe. And they're big mountains  thousands of feet tall  some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface  creating islands like Hawaii. And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart  creating a rift valley. And when you dive into that rift valley  that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this        mile range. And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart  magma  lava is coming up and filling those gaps  and you're looking land    new land    being created right before your eyes. And over the tops of them is       to       meters of water creating enormous pressure  forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth  until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals  reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone. In fact  this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings. And this vent fluid is about     or     degrees F. The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing. So it immediately cools  and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved  and it precipitates out  forming black smoke. And it forms these towers  these chimneys that are            feet tall. And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life. You've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to    feet long. And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes. And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals  shrimp  fish  lobsters  crab  clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold. And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until    years ago. And it completely threw science on its head. It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun. And before the discovery of these vents  all life on Earth  the key to life on Earth  was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis. But down there  there is no sun  there is no photosynthesis  it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it  and it's all so ephemeral. You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent  which you think at the time has to be on another planet. It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth  it looks like aliens in an alien environment. But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead. There's no hot water. All of the animals are gone  they're dead  and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town  an eerie  spooky ghost town  but essentially devoid of animals  of course. But    miles down the ridge... pshhh  There's another volcano going. And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed. And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every    or    years all along the ridge. And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that I've seen in    years of traveling around  making films. Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay. And you go back  and I'm at home  and I'm thinking   Okay  what can I shoot ... Ah  I know where I can shoot that. There's this beautiful bay  lots of soft corals and stomatopods.  And you show up  and it's dead. There's no coral  algae growing on it  and the water's pea soup. You think   Well  what happened   And you turn around  and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in  and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth. And over here there's a golf course going in. And this is the tropics. It's raining like crazy here. So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside  carrying with it sediments from the construction site  smothering the coral and killing it. And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course    the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals  fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom    and there's your pea soup. But  encouragingly  I've seen just the opposite. I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay. And I looked at it  just said   Yuck   and go and work on the other side of the island. Five years later  come back  and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful. It's got living coral  fish all over the place  crystal clear water  and you go   How did that happen   Well  how it happened is the local community galvanized. They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it  enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay  and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay  and the bay recovered. The ocean has an amazing ability to recover  if we'll just leave it alone. I think Margaret Mead said it best. She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world. Indeed  it's the only thing that ever has. And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay. I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations. I've been to a lot of lectures where  at the end of it  inevitably  one of the first questions that comes up is   But  but what can I do  I'm an individual. I'm one person. And these problems are so large and global  and it's just overwhelming.  Fair enough question. My answer to that is don't look at the big  overwhelming issues of the world. Look in your own backyard. Look in your heart  actually. What do you really care about that isn't right where you live  And fix it. Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same. And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map  little dots on a map. And in fact  the way that we can communicate today    where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China  and the Kiwis did this  and then over in England they tried to ... and everybody is talking to everyone else    it's not isolated points on a map anymore  it's a network we've created. And maybe these healing zones can start growing  and possibly even overlap  and good things can happen. So that's how I answer that question. Look in your own backyard  in fact  look in the mirror. What can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now  And do that  and spread the word. The vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live  but up here we can. In theory  we're thinking  rational human beings. And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment  like those people changed the health of that bay. Now  Sylvia's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could  everything we could  to set aside not pin pricks  but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation   hope spots   she calls them. And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that. And it's my hope that some of these  hope spots  can be in the deep ocean  an area that has historically been seriously neglected  if not abused. The term  deep six  comes to mind   If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill  deep six it   So  I hope that we can also keep some of these  hope spots  in the deep sea. Now  I don't get a wish  but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle's wish. And that I do. Thank you very much.  Applause  When we park in a big parking lot  how do we remember where we parked our car  Here's the problem facing Homer. And we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain. So we'll start with the hippocampus  shown in yellow  which is the organ of memory. If you have damage there  like in Alzheimer's  you can't remember things including where you parked your car. It's named after Latin for  seahorse   which it resembles. And like the rest of the brain  it's made of neurons. So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it. And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other. The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells  which are very densely interconnected. And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food. So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here. And when it fires a little spike of electricity  there's going to be a red dot and a click. So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment. And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike. So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location. And if we record from lots of different neurons  we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment  like in this square box shown here. So together they form a map for the rest of the brain  telling the brain continually   Where am I now within my environment   Place cells are also being recorded in humans. So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring. And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town. And place cells in their hippocampi would fire  become active  start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town. So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment  Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important. So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in. And when you expand the box  the firing location expands. The one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south. And if you put another wall inside the box  then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box. So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you    extended buildings and so on    is particularly important for the hippocampus. And indeed  on the inputs to the hippocampus  cells are found which project into the hippocampus  which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around. So the cell on the left  you can see  it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east  whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table  which the animals are running around. And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south  whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart. So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around. We can also test where we think objects are  like this goal flag  in simple environments    or indeed  where your car would be. So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember. And then  if we put them back in the environment  generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was. But on some trials  we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell. In that case  we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment. And what you see  for example  if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment  and then if you ask people where it was  but you've made the environment bigger  where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out. It's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location  and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern. That guides you back to the location that you want to remember. But we also know where we are through movement. So if we take some outbound path    perhaps we park and we wander off    we know because our own movements  which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back. And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell. Now grid cells are found  again  on the inputs to the hippocampus  and they're a bit like place cells. But now as the rat explores around  each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid. And if you record from several grid cells    shown here in different colors    each one has a grid like firing pattern across the environment  and each cell's grid like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells. So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one. So together  it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment    a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map  but using triangles. And as it moves around  the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is  so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment. Do people have grid cells  Well because all of the grid like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry  the same orientations of grid  shown in orange here  it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between. So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal. And indeed  you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex  which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats. So back to Homer. He's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked. And that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells. He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park  which would be represented in the firing of grid cells. Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire. And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car. And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there. Maybe it's been towed. But he knows where it was  so he knows to go and get it. So beyond spatial memory  if we look for this grid like firing pattern throughout the whole brain  we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks  like remembering the last time you went to a wedding  for example. So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene  at least  of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them. So if this was happening  your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint. And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space. Another kind of cell  head direction cells  which I didn't mention yet  they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing. They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery  so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding  for example. So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains. Thank you very much. What I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world    Australia  United States  U.K. and so on    face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time. If you think about the sorts of things that we've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years  we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan  but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on. And a lot of these deployments that we're actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional wars. In fact  a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that  in their own countries  in Australia  the United States and so on  would actually be done by police officers. And so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations  because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for  and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for. Now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs. If Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example  we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go. So when we have to send someone  we send the military    because they're there  they're available and  heck  they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support. So they are able to do it in that sense. But they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are. And so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues. One particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether  when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs  we ought to be equipping them differently  and in particular  whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non lethal weapons that police have. Since they're doing some of these same jobs  maybe they should have some of those things. And of course  there's a range of places where you'd think those things would be really useful. So for example  when you've got military checkpoints. If people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel there are unsure whether this person's hostile or not. Say this person approaching here  and they say   Well is this a suicide bomber or not  Have they got something hidden under their clothing  What's going to happen   They don't know whether this person's hostile or not. If this person doesn't follow directions  then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterward either  yes  we shot the right person  or  no  this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on. So if they had non lethal weapons then they would say   Well we can use them in that sort of situation. If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile  at least we haven't killed them.  Another situation. This photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late     s. Situation's a little bit different where perhaps they know someone who's hostile  where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile  throwing rocks  whatever. But if they respond  there's a range of other people around  who are innocent people who might also get hurt    be collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about. So again  they would say   Well if we have access to non lethal weapons  if we've got someone we know is hostile  we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place  at least  again  we're not going to kill them.  Another suggestion has been  since we're putting so many robots in the field  we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous. They're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop. And so the suggestion is  well hey  if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this  maybe it would be a good idea  again  with these things if they were armed with non lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person  again  they haven't actually killed them. Now there's a whole range of different sorts of non lethal weapons  some of which are obviously available now  some of which they're developing. So you've got traditional things like pepper spray  O.C. spray up at the top there  or Tasers over here. The one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them. You've got non lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones. And this one in the middle here  the large truck  is actually called the Active Denial System    something the U.S. military is working on at the moment. It's essentially a big microwave transmitter. It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray. It goes out to a really long distance  compared to any of these other sorts of things. And anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way. It is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven  but it is basically boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin. So you feel this massive heat  and you go   I want to get out of the way.  And they're thinking  well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area  if the crowd is being hostile. If we need to keep people away from a particular place  we can do that with these sorts of things. So obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking a them and saying   Hey  these things could be really useful.  But as I said  the military and the police are very different. Yes  you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different. In particular  the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different. The police    and knowing because I've actually helped to train police    police  in particular Western jurisdictions at least  are trained to de escalate force  to try and avoid using force wherever possible  and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort. Military personnel are being trained for war  so they're trained that  as soon as things go bad  their first response is lethal force. The moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine  you can start shooting at people. So their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different  and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police. And since we've already had so many problems with police use of non lethal weapons in various ways  I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context. And I was really surprised when I started to do this  to see that  in fact  even those people who were advocating the use of non lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that. They generally seem to think   Well  why would we care what's happened with the police  We're looking at something different   and didn't seem to recognize  in fact  they were looking at pretty much the same stuff. So I actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non lethal weapons when they're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them. And of course  being Australian  I started looking at stuff in Australia  knowing  again  from my own experience about various times when non lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia. So one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of O.C. spray  oleoresin capsicum spray  pepper spray  by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced  what had happened and those sorts of issues. And one study that I found  a particularly interesting one  was actually in Queensland  because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly. And I went and had a look at some of the figures here. Now when they introduced O.C. spray in Queensland  they were really explicit. The police minister had a whole heap of public statements made about it. They were saying   This is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting. This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone.  So I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures. And you can't actually find them very easily for individual Australian states. I could only find these ones. This is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report. As you can see from the fine print  if you can read it at the top   Police shooting deaths  means not just people who have been shot by police  but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police. But this is the figures across the entire country. And the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said   Yes  this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to O.C. spray.  So you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years. There was a spike  of course  a few years before  but that wasn't actually Queensland. Anyone know where that was  Wasn't Port Arthur  no. Victoria  Yes  correct. That spike was all Victoria. So it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on. So six shootings across the whole country  fairly consistently over the years before. So the next two years were the years they studied              . Anyone want to take a stab at the number of times  given how they've introduced this  the number of times police in Queensland used O.C. spray in that period  Hundreds  One  three. Thousand is getting better. Explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force    an alternative between shouting and shooting. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland police didn't have O.C. spray  they wouldn't have shot       people in those two years. In fact  if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at  the material they were collecting and examining  you can see the suspects were only armed in about    percent of cases where O.C. spray was used. It was routinely being used in this period  and  of course  still is routinely used    because there were no complaints about it  not within the context of this study anyway    it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent  who were potentially violent  and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non compliant. This person is not doing anything violent  but they just won't do what we want them to. They're not obeying the directions that we're giving them  so we'll give them a shot of the O.C. spray. That'll speed them up. Everything will work out better that way. This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms  but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems. Now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non lethal weapons    and people when they're actually saying   Well hey  there might be some problems     there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on. One of those problems is that non lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately. One of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate. You have to be careful about who you're shooting at. So one of the problems that's been suggested with non lethal weapons is that they might be used indiscriminately    that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore. And in fact  one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Dubrovka Theatre siege in Moscow in       which probably a lot of you  unlike most of my students at ADFA  are actually old enough to remember. So Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater. They were holding something like     people hostage. They'd released a bunch of people  but they still had about     people hostage. And the Russian special military police  special forces  Spetsnaz  came in and actually stormed the theater. And the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas. And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas. It was used indiscriminately. They pumped the whole theater full of the gas. And it's no surprise that people died  because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale  what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on. There were  in fact  only a couple of people who got shot in this episode. So when they had a look at it afterward  there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation. Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas. The final toll of hostages is a little unclear  but it's certainly a few more than that  because there were other people who died over the next few days. So this was one particular problem they talked about  that it might be used indiscriminately. Second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non lethal weapons  and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention  it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare  the problem with that is that it's seen that sometimes non lethal weapons might actually be used  not as an alternative to lethal force  but as a lethal force multiplier    that you use non lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective. The people you're going to be shooting at aren't going to be able to get out of the way. They're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better. And in fact  that's exactly what happened here. The hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody  they were simply shot in the head. So this non lethal weapon was being used  in fact  in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation. Another problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use non lethal weapons and get trained about them and then get tested and so on. Because they get tested in nice  safe environments. And people get taught to use them in nice  safe environments like this  where you can see exactly what's going on. The person who's spraying the O.C. spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on. But they don't ever get used like that. They get used out in the real world  like in Texas  like this. I confess  this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this. It happened while I was working as a research fellow at the U.S. Naval Academy. And news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer. She wasn't violent. In fact  he was probably six inches taller than me  and she was about this tall. And eventually she said to him  Well I'm going to get back in my car.  And he says   If you get back into your car  I'm going to tase you.  And she says   Oh  go ahead. Tase me.  And so he does. And it's all captured by the video camera running in the front of the police car. So she's     and it's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her. And other examples of the same sorts of things with other people where you think where you think   Is this really an appropriate way to use non lethal weapons    Police chief fires Taser into    year old girl's head.   She was running away. What else was I suppose to do   Or Florida   Police Taser six year old boy at elementary school.  And they clearly learned a lot from it because in the same district   Police review policy after children shocked   nd child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks.  Same police district. Another child within weeks of Tasering the six year old boy. Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States  it happened in Canada as well. And a colleague of mine sent me this one from London. But my personal favorite of these ones  I have to confess  does actually come from the United States   Officers Taser    year old disabled woman in her bed.  I checked the reports on this one. I looked at it. I was really surprised. Apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed. I kid you not. That's exactly what it said.  She took up a more threatening position in her bed.  Okay. But I'd remind you what I'm talking about  I'm talking about military uses of non lethal weapons. So why is this relevant  Because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are. They're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are. They're trained to think more  to try and de escalate. So if you have these problems with police officers with non lethal weapons  what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel  The last thing that I would just like to say  when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non lethal weapon would look like  they almost inevitably say the same thing. They say   Well  it's got to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon. So if you threaten to use it  people are going to comply with it  but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects.  In other words  your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse. What would these guys have done if they'd had access to Tasers or to a manned  portable version of the Active Denial System    a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it. So I think  yes  there may be ways that non lethal weapons are going to be great in these situations  but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well. Thanks very much. Both myself and my brother belong to the under    demographic  which Pat said makes    percent  but according to our statistics it makes    percent of the region's population. Qatar is no exception to the region. It's a very young nation led by young people. We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies and the iPods  and for me the abaya  my traditional dress that I'm wearing today. Now this is not a religious garment  nor is it a religious statement. Instead  it's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear. Now I remember a few years ago  a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha  who's sitting here  president of Qatar University    who  by the way  is a woman    he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way. Her answer was quite the contrary. Instead  she felt more free  more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya. She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care. Not that you do  I'm just saying. My point is here  people have a choice    just like the Indian lady could wear her sari or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono. We are changing our culture from within  but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions. We know that modernization is happening. And yes  Qatar wants to be a modern nation. But at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage. It's important for us to grow organically. And we continuously make the conscious decision to reach that balance. In fact  research has shown that the more the world is flat  if I use Tom Friedman's analogy  or global  the more and more people are wanting to be different. And for us young people  they're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves. Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global. We don't want to be all the same  but we want to respect each other and understand each other. And therefore tradition becomes more important  not less important. Life necessitates a universal world  however  we believe in the security of having a local identity. And this is what the leaders of this region are trying to do. We're trying to be part of this global village  but at the same time we're revising ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development. I'm a representation of that phenomenon. And I think a lot of people in this room  I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself. And I'm sure  although we can't see the people in Washington  they are in the same position. We're continuously trying to straddle different worlds  different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves and from others. So I want to ask a question  What should culture in the   st century look like  In a time where the world is becoming personalized  when the mobile phone  the burger  the telephone  everything has its own personal identity  how should we perceive ourselves and how should we perceive others  How does that impact our desert culture  I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and  the more recent  Museum of Islamic Art opened in Qatar in     . I myself am personalizing these cultural developments  but I also understand that this has to be done organically. Yes  we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions  but what I think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can't happen from outside  it has to come from within. And guess what  You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf who are leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women. I want to ask you  why do you think this is  Is it because it's a soft option  we have nothing else to do  No  I don't think so. I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally. It's a natural component for bringing people together  discussing ideas    in the same way we're doing here at TED. We're here  we're part of a community  sharing out ideas and discussing them. Art becomes a very important part of our national identity. The existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation's development of cultural identity is very important. You know  art and culture is big business. Ask me. Ask the chairpersons and CEOs of Sotheby's and Christie's. Ask Charles Saatchi about great art. They make a lot of money. So I think women in our society are becoming leaders  because they realize that for their future generations  it's very important to maintain our cultural identities. Why else do Greeks demand the return of the Elgin Marbles  And why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum  Why does it take me months on end to get an export license from London or New York in order to get pieces into my country  In few hours  Shirin Neshat  my friend from Iran who's a very important artist for us will be talking to you. She lives in New York City  but she doesn't try to be a Western artist. Instead  she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture  nation and heritage. She does that through important visual forms of photography and film. In the same way  Qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within. Our mission is of cultural integration and independence. We don't want to have what there is in the West. We don't want their collections. We want to build our own identities  our own fabric  create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us. In a few days  we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art. We have done extensive research to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists  and Arabs who are not Muslims    not all Arabs are Muslims  by the way    but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution. This institution is government backed and it has been the case for the past three decades. We will open the museum in a few days  and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways and come and join us. Now this museum is just as important to us as the West. Some of you might have heard of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine  but I doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in Picasso's studio in Paris in the     s. For me it was a new discovery. And I think with time  in the years to come we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos  our Legers and our Cezannes. We do have artists  but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet. Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration. We have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of YouTube and social networking to express their stories  share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices. In a similar way  we have created the Doha Film Institute. Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking. Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker. Today I am proud to say we have trained and educated over    Qatari women filmmakers to edit  tell their own stories in their own voices. Now if you'll allow me  I would love to share a one minute film that has proven to show that a    sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture. And this is one of our filmmakers' products. Who are you playing  Girl  Uncle Khaled. Here  put on the headscarf. Khaled  Why would I want to put it on  Girl  Do as you're told  young girl. Boy  No  you play mom and I play dad.  Girl  But it's my game.  Play by yourself then. Girl  Women  One word and they get upset. Useless. Thank you. Thank you  SM  Going back to straddling between East and West  last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival here in Doha. The Doha Tribeca Film Festival was held at our new cultural hub  Katara. It attracted        people  and we showcased    films. Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival is not an imported festival  but rather an important festival between the cities of New York and Doha. It's important for two things. First  it allows us to showcase our Arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world  New York City. At the same time  we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world. They're learning our culture  our language  our heritage and realizing we're just as different and just the same as each other. Now over and over again  people have said   Let's build bridges   and frankly  I want to do more than that. I would like break the walls of ignorance between East and West    no  not the soft option that we have discussed before  but rather the soft power that Joseph Nye has spoken about before. Culture's a very important tool to bring people together. We should not underestimate it.  Know thyself   that is the journey of self expression and self realization that we are traveling. Now I don't pretend to have all the answers  but I know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading. This is a very interesting journey. I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions. Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it. Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much. Shokran. Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations  I'm interested in how many are three to    years old. None  huh  All right. I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age  Dinosaurs are kind of funny  you know. We're going to kind of go in a different direction right now. I hope you all realize that. So I'll just give you my message up front  Try not to go extinct. That's it. People ask me a lot    in fact  one of the most asked questions I get is  why do children like dinosaurs so much  What's the fascination  And I usually just say   Well dinosaurs were big  different and gone.  They're all gone. Well that's not true  but we'll get to the goose in a minute. So that's sort of the theme  big  different and gone. The title of my talk  Shape shifting Dinosaurs  The Cause of a Premature Extinction. Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. And there's lots of different shapes. Lots of different kinds. A long time ago  back in the early     s  museums were out looking for dinosaurs. They went out and gathered them up. And this is an interesting story. Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had. So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur  a big one  then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one. And that happened for all museums. So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs. And this was in the early     s. By about       some scientists were sitting around and they thought   What in the world  Look at these dinosaurs. They're all big. Where are all the little ones   And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it   Where are the little dinosaurs   Well  go to a museum  you'll see  see how many baby dinosaurs there are. People assumed    and this was actually a problem    people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs  if they had juvenile dinosaurs  they'd be easy to identify. You'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur. But all they had were big dinosaurs. And it comes down to a couple of things. First off  scientists have egos  and scientists like to name dinosaurs. They like to name anything. Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named. And so every time they found something that looked a little different  they named it something different. And what happened  of course  is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs. In       a light went on in somebody's head. Dr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do  which is different than the way reptiles grow. And in fact  he used the cassowary as an example. And it's kind of cool    if you look at the cassowary  or any of the birds that have crests on their heads  they actually grow to about    percent adult size before the crest starts to grow. Now think about that. They're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny. So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth. So you can see that if you actually found one that was    percent grown and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary  you would think they were two different animals. So this was a problem  and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus. And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like  if it grew in sort of a linear fashion  it would have a crest about half the size of the adult. But the actual sub adult at    percent had no crest at all. So this was interesting. So this is where people went astray again. I mean  if they'd have just taken that  taken Peter Dodson's work  and gone on with that  then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have. But scientists have egos  they like to name things. And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different. Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur  or any animal  is a young one or an older one. And that's by actually cutting into their bones. But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do  as you can imagine  because in museums bones are precious. You go into a museum and they take really good care of them. They put them in foam  little containers. They're very well taken care of. They don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside. So they don't normally let you do that. But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open. So that's what I do. So if you cut open a little dinosaur  it's very spongy inside like A. And if you cut into an older dinosaur  it's very massive. You can tell it's mature bone. So it's real easy to tell them apart. So what I want to do is show you these. In North America in the Northern Plains of the United States and the Southern Plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan  there's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth. And there are    of them that everyone recognizes    I mean the    primary dinosaurs that went extinct. And so we will evaluate them. And that's sort of what I've been doing. So my students  my staff  we've been cutting them open. Now as you can imagine  cutting open a leg bone is one thing  but when you go to a museum and say   You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull do you   they say   Go away.  So here are    dinosaurs. And we want to look at these three first. So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs. And everybody knows that these three animals are related. And the assumption is is that they're related like cousins or whatever. But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related. In other words  people looked at them and they saw the differences. And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you're related to your brother or your sister  you can't do it by looking at differences. You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities. So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are. Pachycephalosaurus has a big  thick dome on its head  and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head  and it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose. And then Stygimoloch  another dinosaur from the same age  lived at the same time  has spikes sticking out the back of its head. It's got a little  tiny dome  and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose. And then there's this thing called Dracorex  Hogwart's Eye. Guess where that came from  Dragon. So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head  no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike. But they did look at these three and they said   These are three different dinosaurs  and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them. And the other one is more primitive than the other. It's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out. But if you line them up  if you just take those three skulls and just line them up  they line up like this. Dracorex is the littlest one  Stygimoloch is the middle size one  Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. And one would think  that should give me a clue. But it didn't give them a clue. Because  well we know why. Scientists like to name things. So if we cut open Dracorex    I cut open our Dracorex    and look  it was spongy inside  really spongy inside. I mean  it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast. So it is going to get bigger. If you cut open Stygimoloch  it is doing the same thing. The dome  that little dome  is growing really fast. It's inflating very fast. What's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing  which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger. And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus  Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing. So just with these three dinosaurs  you can easily    as a scientist    we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal. Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. Okay. Which of course means we have    primary dinosaurs to deal with. So a colleague of mine at Berkley  he and I were looking at Triceratops. And before the year         now remember  Triceratops was first found in the     s    before       no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops. There's a Triceratops in every museum in the world  but no one had ever collected a juvenile. And we know why  right  Because everybody wants to have a big one. So everyone had a big one. So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones. They're everywhere. They're all over the place. So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum. And everybody says it's because I have a little museum. When you have a little museum  you have little dinosaurs. If you look at the Triceratops  you can see it's changing  it's shape shifting. As the juveniles are growing up  their horns actually curve backwards. And then as they grow older  the horns grow forward. And that's pretty cool. If you look along the edge of the frill  they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs. And then  because the juveniles are in my collection  I cut them open and look inside. And the little one is really spongy. And the middle size one is really spongy. But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy. And this is a skull that is two meters long. It's a big skull. But there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops  except it's bigger  and it's called Torosaurus. And Torosaurus  when we cut into it  has mature bone. But it's got these big holes in its shield. And everybody says   A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one.   And it has holes in its frill.  And I said   Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses   And they said   Well no  but it has holes in its frill.  So one of my graduate students  John Scannella  looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and  of course it's open  in Torosaurus    so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus  which was pretty cool. So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops. Now when we name dinosaurs  when we name anything  the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out. So Torosaurus is extinct. Triceratops  if you've heard the news  a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out  but that's not going to happen. All right  so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs. I mean  here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Anatotitan  giant duck. It's a giant duck bill dinosaur. Here's another one. So we look at the bone histology. The bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile  or at least a sub adult  and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny. And we get rid of Anatotitan. So we can just keep doing this. And the last one is T. Rex. So there's these two dinosaurs  T. Rex and Nanotyrannus. Again  makes you wonder. But they had a good question. They were looking at them and they said   One's got    teeth  and the biggest one's got    teeth. And that doesn't make any sense at all  because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older. So it must be true    they must be different.  So we cut into them. And sure enough  Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. It looks like it could still get bigger. And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work  I have four T. Rexes  so I can cut a whole bunch of them. But I didn't have to cut any of them really  because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had    teeth and the next smallest one had    and the next smallest had   . And of course  Nano has   . And we just went out and looked at other people's collections and we found one that has sort of    teeth. So again  real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus  and therefore we can take out another dinosaur. So when it comes down to our end cretaceous  we have seven left. And that's a good number. That's a good number to go extinct  I think. Now as you can imagine  this is not very popular with fourth graders. Fourth graders love their dinosaurs  they memorize them. And they're not happy with this. Thank you very much. I'm here to share my photography. Or is it photography  Because  of course  this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera. Yet  my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of   . It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing  but it was a bit different  because using the camera  the process was in the planning instead. And when you take a photograph with a camera  the process ends when you press the trigger. So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time. I felt like anyone could do that. So I wanted to create something different  something where the process starts when you press the trigger. Photos like this  construction going on along a busy road. But it has an unexpected twist. And despite that  it retains a level of realism. Or photos like these    both dark and colorful  but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism. When I say realism  I mean photo realism. Because  of course  it's not something you can capture really  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph. Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick. So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really. But what's the trick that makes it look realistic  Is it something about the details or the colors  Is it something about the light  What creates the illusion  Sometimes the perspective is the illusion. But in the end  it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two dimensional surface. It's not really what is realistic  it's what we think looks realistic really. So I think the basics are quite simple. I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality. And let me show you a simple example. Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects  something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world. But combined in a certain way  they can create something that still looks three dimensional  like it could exist. But at the same time  we know it can't. So we trick our brains  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense. And I see the same process with combining photographs. It's just really about combining different realities. So the things that make a photograph look realistic  I think it's the things that we don't even think about  the things all around us in our daily lives. But when combining photographs  this is really important to consider  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result. As you can see  these images aren't really special. But combined  they can create something like this. So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective. Secondly  photos combined should have the same type of light. And these two images both fulfill these two requirements    shot at the same height and in the same type of light. The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless. Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed. So by matching color  contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images  adding photographic defects like depth of field  desaturated colors and noise  we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image  despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically. So here's another example. One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated. But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations. I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place  because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head. But it does require a lot of planning. And getting this idea during winter  I knew that I had several months to plan it  to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically. So for example  the fish was captured on a fishing trip. The shores are from a different location. The underwater part was captured in a stone pit. And yeah  I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish. So to achieve a realistic result  I think it comes down to planning. It always starts with a sketch  an idea. Then it's about combining the different photographs. And here every piece is very well planned. And if you do a good job capturing the photos  the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic. So all the tools are out there  and the only thing that limits us is our imagination. Thank you. How many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader  See  I've asked that question all the way across the country  and everywhere I ask it  no matter where  there's always a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand. And I've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us. We've made into something beyond us. We've made it about changing the world. And we've taken this title of leader  and we treat it as if it's something that one day we're going to deserve  but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with. And I worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we've convinced ourselves that those are the only things worth celebrating  and we start to devalue the things that we can do every day  and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves take credit for it  and we don't let ourselves feel good about it. And I've been lucky enough over the last    years to work with some amazing people who have helped me redefine leadership in a way that I think has made me happier. And with my short time today  I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition. I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville  New Brunswick  and on my last day there  a girl came up to me and she said   I remember the first time that I met you.  And then she told me a story that had happened four years earlier. She said   On the day before I started university  I was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad  and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this  that I wasn't ready for university  that I just burst into tears. And my mom and my dad were amazing. They were like  'Look  we know you're scared  but let's just go tomorrow. Let's go to the first day  and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this  that's fine  just tell us  we will take you home. We love you no matter what.'  And she says   So I went the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration  and I looked around and I just knew I couldn't do it. I knew I wasn't ready. I knew I had to quit.  And she says   I made that decision  and as soon as I made it  there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me. And I turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home  and just at that moment  you came out of the Student Union building wearing the stupidest hat I have ever seen in my life.   Laughter   It was awesome. And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama  which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis     a charity I've worked with for years    and you had a bucketful of lollipops. And you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about Shinerama. And all of a sudden  you got to me  and you just stopped  and you stared. It was creepy.   Laughter  This girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about.  Laughter   And then you looked at the guy next to me  and you smiled  and you reached in your bucket  and you pulled out a lollipop  and you held it out to him  and you said  'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman standing next to you.'  And she said   I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life. He turned beet red  and he wouldn't even look at me. He just kind of held the lollipop out like this.   Laughter   And I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop  and as soon as I did  you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad  and you said  'Look at that. Look at that. First day away from home  and already she's taking candy from a stranger  '   Laughter  And she said   Everybody lost it. Twenty feet in every direction  everyone started to howl. And I know this is cheesy  and I don't know why I'm telling you this  but in that moment when everyone was laughing  I knew that I shouldn't quit. I knew that I was where I was supposed to be  and I knew that I was home  and I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day  but I heard that you were leaving  and I had to come up and tell you that you've been an incredibly important person in my life  and I'm going to miss you. Good luck.  And she walks away  and I'm flattened. And she gets about six feet away  she turns around and smiles  and goes   You should probably know this  too. I'm still dating that guy four years later.   Laughter  A year and a half after I moved to Toronto  I got an invitation to their wedding. Here's the kicker. I don't remember that. I have no recollection of that moment  and I've searched my memory banks  because that is funny and I should remember doing it  and I don't remember it. And that was such an eye opening  transformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life  a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say   You've been an incredibly important person in my life   was a moment that I didn't even remember. How many of you guys have a lollipop moment  a moment where someone said something or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better  All right. How many of you have told that person they did it  See  why not  We celebrate birthdays  where all you have to do is not die for     days    Laughter    and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it. And every single one of you  every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment. You have made someone's life better by something that you said or that you did  and if you think you haven't  think about all the hands that didn't go back up when I asked that question. You're just one of the people who hasn't been told. But it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful. It can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people  because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us  as long as we keep leadership something beyond us  as long as we make it about changing the world  we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other. Marianne Williamson said   Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light  and not our darkness  that frightens us.  And my call to action today is that we need to get over that. We need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives. We need to get over it so we can move beyond it  and our little brothers and our little sisters  and one day our kids    or our kids right now    can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives more than money and power and titles and influence. We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments  how many of them we create  how many of them we acknowledge  how many of them we pay forward  and how many of them we say thank you for. Because we've made leadership about changing the world  and there is no world. There's only six billion understandings of it  and if you change one person's understanding of it  one person's understanding of what they're capable of  one person's understanding of how much people care about them  one person's understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world  you've changed the whole thing. And if we can understand leadership like that  I think if we can redefine leadership like that  I think we can change everything. And it's a simple idea  but I don't think it's a small one  and I want to thank you all so much for letting me share it with you today. Penelope Jagessar Chaffer  I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house. No  I'm just joking. It's interesting  because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body. Now it's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin. And these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors. That was the start of my journey to make this film   Toxic Baby.  And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue. One is that you and I all have between    to        chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn't have. And many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we're seeing across industrialized nations. I'll show you some statistics. So for example  in the United Kingdom  the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by    percent just in a generation. Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S. In Canada  we're now looking at one in    Canadian children with asthma. That's a four fold increase. Again  similar story around the world. In the United States  probably the most astonishing statistic is a     percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities. Again  we're seeing that trend across Europe  across North America. And in Europe  there's certain parts of Europe  where we're seeing a four fold increase in certain genital birth defects. Interestingly  one of those birth defects has seen a     percent increase in the U.S. So a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes  premature puberty. So it's interesting for me  when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things  that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs. Tyrone Hayes  It was a surprise to me as well that I would be talking about pesticides  that I'd be talking about public health  because  in fact  I never thought I would do anything useful. Frogs. In fact  my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if I would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians  or my frogs. It turns out  atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world. It's the number one contaminant of groundwater  drinking water  rain water. In       after my studies  it was banned in the European Union  but in that same year  the United States EPA re registered the compound. We were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine     .  parts per billion    that it produced animals that look like this. These are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes  two ovaries  another large testis  more ovaries  which is not normal ... even for amphibians. In some cases  another species like the North American Leopard Frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes. And you can see these large  yolked up eggs bursting through the surface of this male's testes. Now my wife tells me  and I'm sure Penelope can as well  that there's nothing more painful than childbirth    which that I'll never experience  I can't really argue that    but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five. In recent studies that we've published  we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine  some of the males grow up and completely become females. So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship. And not only do these genetic males mate with other males  they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though they're genetic males. What we proposed  and what we've now generated support for  is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance. Normally the testes should make testosterone  the male hormone. But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme  the machinery if you will  aromatase  that converts testosterone into estrogen. And as a result  these exposed males lose their testosterone  they're chemically castrated  and they're subsequently feminized because now they're making the female hormone. Now this is what brought me to the human related issues. Because it turns out that the number one cancer in women  breast cancer  is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase. So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast  aromatase converts androgens into estrogens  and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads. In fact  this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole  which blocks aromatase  blocks estrogen  so that if you developed a mutated cell  it doesn't grow into a tumor. Now what's interesting is  of course  that we're still using    million pounds of atrazine  the number one contaminant in drinking water  that does the opposite    turns on aromatase  increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors  breast cancer  in humans. What's interesting is  in fact  the same company that sold us    million pounds of atrazine  the breast cancer promoter  now sells us the blocker    the exact same company. And so I find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it  we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment. PJC  So speaking of estrogen  one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol A  BPA  which has been in the news recently. It's a plasticizer. It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic  which is what baby bottles are made out of. And what's interesting about BPA is that it's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy. And there have been many  many  many studies that have shown that BPA leaches from babies' bottles into the formula  into the milk  and therefore into the babies. So we're dosing our babies  our newborns  our infants  with a synthetic estrogen. Now two weeks ago or so  the European Union passed a law banning the use of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. And for those of you who are not parents  sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles. But just two weeks before that  the U.S. Senate refused to even debate the banning of BPA in babies' bottles and sippy cups. So it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is. now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A  it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent's awareness that stands between chemicals and our children. The baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure. However  if we parents are unaware  we are leaving our children to fend for themselves. TH  And what Penelope says here is even more true. For those of you who don't know  we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction. Scientists agree now. We are losing species from the Earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared  and leading that loss are amphibians.    percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline. And I believe  many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline. In part  amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water    no eggshells  no membranes and no placenta. In fact  our invention    by  our  I mean we mammals    one of our big inventions was the placenta. But we also start out as aquatic organisms. But it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals  the placenta  cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals that it's never seen before. The evidence of that is that studies in rats  again with atrazine  show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion. Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones. Of those rats that don't abort  atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man's disease. Of those that don't abort  atrazine causes impaired mammary  or breast  development in the exposed daughters in utero  so that their breast don't develop properly. And as a result  when those rats grow up  their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups. So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to. And given the life of many of these chemicals  generations  years  dozens of years  that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today. And this is not just philosophical  it's already known  that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen  PCBs  DDT cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby's in the womb. In addition to that  after the baby's born  our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they're born. We already know that chemicals like DDT and DES and atrazine can also pass over into milk  again  affecting our babies even after their born. PJC  So when Tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ  I'm thinking  how do I demonstrate that  How do you show that  And it's interesting when you make a film like this  because you're stuck trying to visualize science that there's no visualization for. And I have to take a little bit of artistic license. Old man  Placenta control. What is it  Oh what  Puffuffuff  what  Perflourooctanoic acid. Blimey. Never heard of it. PJC  And neither had I actually before I started making this film. And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child  it made me start to think  what would my fetus say to me  What would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure that's happening everyday  day after day  I had some octyphenols  some artificial musks and some bisphenol A. Help me. PJC  It's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this. This is our issue  because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children. We are in effect polluting our children. And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when I found out I was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat. So my child's death  my baby's death  really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film. And it's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story  which is not what you originally intend. And so when Tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment  this is my contaminated environment. This is my toxic baby. And that's something that's just profound and sad  but astonishing because so many of us don't actually know this. TH  One of this things that's exciting and appropriate for me to be here at TEDWomen is that  well  I think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said   Turn to the man at your table and tell them  'When the revolution starts  we've got your back.'  The truth is  women  you've had our back on this issue for a very long time  starting with Rachel Carson's  Silent Spring  to Theo Colborn's  Our Stolen Future  to Sandra Steingraber's books  Living Downstream  and  Having Faith.  And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation    like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about    years ago    perhaps it's that connection that makes women activists in this particular area. But for the men here  I want to say it's not just women and children that are at risk. And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine  the testes are full of holes and spaces  because the hormone imbalance  instead of allowing sperm to be generated  such as in the testis here  the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as    percent. It's not just my work in amphibians  but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe  holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America and in rats  an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well. And of course  we don't do these experiments in humans  but just by coincidence  my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count  low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine. These are just men who live in an agricultural community. Men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine. And the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine  up to levels that are        times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men. Of course  most of them     percent are Mexican  Mexican American. And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to. They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin  which was originally used as a nerve gas. And many of these workers have life expectancies of only   . It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us  just like Rachel Carson and others have warned. As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda  the agricultural runoff from this crop  which goes into these buckets  is the sole source of drinking  cooking and bathing water for this village. Now if I told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes  the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear. You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it. The problem is  in my village  Oakland  in most of our villages  we don't see that connection. We turn on the faucet  the water comes out  we assume it's safe  and we assume that we are masters of our environment  rather than being part of it. PJC  So it doesn't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue. And I kept thinking over and over again this question. We know so much about global warming and climate change  and yet  we have no concept of what I've been calling internal environmentalism. We know what we're putting out there  we have a sense of those repercussions  but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things  or things are put into our bodies. And it's my feeling and it's my urging being here to know that  as we women move forward as the communicators of this  but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children  bearing the children  we hold most of the buying power in the household  is that it's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world. And my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps  but it's also about our children as well. Thank you. Every year in the United States alone            couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ... and not to have sex with anyone else  ever. He buys a ring  she buys a dress. They go shopping for all sorts of things. She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons. And the big day comes. And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with  and they'll vow that nothing  not abject poverty  not life threatening illness  not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion. These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid life crises and a cumulative    lb. weight gain  until that far off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace. You know  because they can't hear the snoring anymore. And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others' faces and do the  Macarena   and we'll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time    even though we know  statistically  half of them will be divorced within a decade. Of course  the other half won't  right  They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll. And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore. And researchers want to know why. I mean  look  it doesn't take a double blind  placebo controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work. Disrespect  boredom  too much time on Facebook  having sex with other people. But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things    respect  excitement  a broken Internet connection  mind numbing monogamy    and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket. So what's going on when it doesn't  What do the folks who make it all the way to side by side burial plots have in common  What are they doing right  What can we learn from them  And if you're still happily sleeping solo  why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life  Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism. And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends. And it turns out  the success stories share a few similarities  actually  beyond they don't have sex with other people. For instance  in the happiest marriages  the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband. Obvious  right. It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because  women  we care a great deal about being thin and good looking  whereas men mostly care about sex ... ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are. The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy  we just have to be thinner than our partners. So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising  we just need to wait for them to get fat  maybe bake a few pies. This is good information to have  and it's not that complicated. Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives. For example  the happy wife. Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run  she might say   Wow  honey  thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner.  These are couples who can find good in any situation.  Yeah  it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire  but it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars  and it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm.  One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work  the more attractive his wife will find him. Because we needed a study to tell us this. But here's what's going on here. The more attractive she finds him  the more sex they have  the more sex they have  the nicer he is to her  the nicer he is to her  the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed    and ultimately  they live happily ever after. In other words  men  you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. Here's an interesting one. One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. This is an actual study  and let me clarify. The researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals. The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. Now I don't know how old all of you are  but when I was a kid  your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film  and  by God  film was expensive. They didn't take     shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest  smileyest one for the Christmas card. Oh no. They dressed you up  they lined you up  and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye. But still  I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce. So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage  Do not win an Oscar for best actress. I'm serious. Bettie Davis  Joan Crawford  Hallie Berry  Hillary Swank  Sandra Bullock  Reese Witherspoon  all of them single soon after taking home that statue. They actually call it the Oscar curse. It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided. And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous. It turns out  merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet. Apparently  the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us  but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will  makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison. And theoretically  I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash  we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. Drinking alcohol  it seems  is bad for your marriage. Yeah. I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline. But here's a scary one  Divorce is contagious. That's right    when you have a close couple friend split up  it increases your chances of getting a divorce by    percent. Now I have to say  I don't get this one at all. My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony. And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. So now you may be wondering  why does anyone get married ever  Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse    a list that includes visitation rights in jail  but hopefully you'll never need that one. But beyond the profound federal perks  married people make more money. We're healthier  physically and emotionally. We produce happier  more stable and more successful kids. We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends    believe it or not. We even live longer  which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place. Now if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return  I can't tell you how to find a chore loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce  but I can only encourage you to try  because the benefits  as I've pointed out  are significant. The bottom line is  whether you're in it or you're searching for it  I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting. So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors. For instance  in my marriage  I'd say I'm doing okay. One the one hand  I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome. So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up. And like I said  we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up. So we have to keep an eye on that. And we do like a cocktail or two. On the other hand  I have the fake happy picture thing. And also  my husband does a lot around the house  and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives. So I've got all those things going for me. But just in case  I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon. And for the good of your relationships  I would encourage you to do the same. I'll see you at the bar. I would like to talk to you about why many e health projects fail. And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients. And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer. Not in a very scientific way    she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients  family  relatives   What's up  How could we help you   And we think  we like to think  that this is one of the major problems why all    maybe not all    but most of the e health projects fail  since we stopped listening. This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing. It's got one knob  on off. And every morning I hop on it. And yes  I've got a challenge  as you might see. And I put my challenge on    kg. But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on  it sends my data through Google Health as well. And it's collected by my general practitioner as well  so he can see what's my problem in weight  not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it  but also looking backward. But there's another thing. As some of you might know  I've got more than       followers on Twitter. So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I'm in my car  people start talking to me   I think you need a light lunch today  Lucien.  But that's the nicest thing that could happen  since this is peer pressure  peer pressure used to help patients    since this could be used for obesity  it could be used to stop smoking in patients. But on the other hand  it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health. As of next week  it will soon be available. There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other. And people will be able  from their homes  to take their blood pressure  send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others  for instance  for over a hundred dollars. And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect  not only their own control again  be captain of their own ship  but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face  like health care cost explosion  doubled demand and things like that. Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team. And you can do this with techniques like this  but also by crowd sourcing. And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video. We've all got navigation controls in our car. We maybe even  have  it in our cellphone. We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht. The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are. And sure  we could find fast food chains. But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient  We asked around and nobody knew. Nobody knew where the nearest life saving AED was to be obtained right now. So what we did  we crowdsourced The Netherlands. We set up a website and asked the crowd   If you see an AED  please submit it  tell us where it is  tell us when it's open   since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed  of course. And over        AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted. The next step we took was to find the applications for it. And we built an iPad application. We made an application for Layar  augmented reality  to find these AEDs. And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses  you can use your iPhone  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone  to find the nearest AED which can save lives. And as of today  we would like to introduce this  not only as AED EU  which is what the product is called  but also AED US. And we would like to start this on a worldwide level. And  we're  asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world  colleague universities  to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd source all these AEDs all around the world. That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you  you can find this. The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. These might be courier services or cable guys for instance  just to see whether the AED that's submitted still is in place. So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better  but take control of it. Thank you. Basking sharks are awesome creatures. They are just magnificent. They grow    meters long. Some say bigger. They might weigh up to two tons. Some say up to five tons. They're the second largest fish in the world. They're also harmless plankton feeding animals. And they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on    kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive. They're fantastic creatures. And we're very lucky in Ireland  we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them. They were also very important to coast communities going back hundreds of years  especially the around the Claddagh  Duff  Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way off shore  sometimes to a place called the Sunfish Bank  which is about    miles west of Achill Island  to kill the basking sharks. This is an old woodcut from the         s. So they were very important  and they were important for the oil out of their liver. A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver  and it's full of oil. You get gallons of oil from their liver. And that oil was used especially for lighting  but also for dressing wounds and other things. In fact  the streetlights in      of Galway  Dublin and Waterford were linked with sunfish oil. And  sunfish  is one of the words for basking sharks. So they were incredibly important animals. They've been around a long time  have been very important to coast communities. Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island. This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island. And sharks used to come into the bay. And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland  string it out along the other net. And as the shark came round  it would hit the net  the net would collapse on it. It would often drown and suffocate. Or at times  they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck. And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor  boil them up  use the oil. They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks. This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide    it is the finning of sharks. We're often all frightened of sharks thanks to  Jaws.  Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year. There was someone recently  wasn't there  Just a couple weeks ago. We kill about     million sharks a year. So I don't know what the balance is  but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them. It was a well documented fishery  and as you can see here  it peaked in the   s where they were killing       sharks a year. And it declined very fast    a classic boom and bust fishery  which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates. And they killed about        sharks in this period  literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay at Achill Island. Sharks were still killed up into the mid   s  especially after places like Dunmore East in County Waterford. And about two and a half        sharks were killed up till '    many by Norwegian vessels. The black  you can't really see this  but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels  and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel. The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language. Now I don't pretend to have any Irish  but in Kerry they were often known as  Ainmhide na seolta   the monster with the sails. And another title would be  Liop an da lapa   the unwieldy beast with two fins.  Liabhan mor   suggesting a big animal. Or my favorite   Liabhan chor greine   the great fish of the sun. And that's a lovely  evocative name. On Tory Island  which is a strange place anyway  they were known as muldoons  and no one seems to know why. Hope there's no one from Tory here  lovely place. But more commonly all around the island  they were known as the sunfish. And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out. There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world. Some people say it's not population decline. It might be a change in the distribution of plankton. And it's been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change  because they're basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open. They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN. There's also moves in Europe to try and stop catching them. There's now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally. They're not protected in Ireland. In fact  they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever  despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside. We know very little about them. And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface. And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface. I only found out last year  at a conference on the Isle of Man  just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly  frequently and predictably come to the surface to  bask.  And it's a fantastic opportunity in science to see and experience basking sharks  and they are awesome creatures. And it gives us a fantastic opportunity to actually study them  to get access to them. So what we've been doing a couple of years    but last year was a big year    is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that. So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active. And we tagged them very simply  not very hi tech  with a big  long pole. This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end. Go up in your boat and tag the shark. And we were very effective. We tagged     sharks last summer. We got    in three days off Inishowen Peninsula. Half the challenge is to get access  is to be in the right place at the right time. But it's a very simple and easy technique. I'll show you what they look like. We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark. One is to try and work out the gender of the shark. We also deployed a couple of satellite tags  so we did use hi tech stuff as well. These are archival tags. So what they do is they store the data. A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite. And of course  sharks  fish  are underwater most of the time. So this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun  plus water temperature and depth. And you have to kind of reconstruct the path. What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period  in this case it was eight months  and literally to the day the tag popped off  drifted up  said hello to the satellite and sent  not all the data  but enough data for us to use. And this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water. And here's a couple of maps that we've done. That one  you can see that we tagged both off Kerry. And basically it spent all its time  the last eight months  in Irish waters. Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge. And here's one that we haven't ground truthed it yet with sea surface temperature and water depth  but again  the second shark kind of spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea. Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man all the way out to Nova Scotia in about    days. That's nine and a half thousand kilometers. We never thought that happened. Another colleague in the States tagged about    sharks off Massachusetts  and his tags didn't really work. All he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off. And his tags popped off in the Caribbean and even in Brazil. And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude. But in actual fact  they're obviously crossing the Equator as well. So very simple things like that  we're trying to learn about basking sharks. One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are. Now I'm not a geneticist  so I'm not going to pretend to understand the genetics. And that's why it's great to have collaboration. Whereas I'm a field person  I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on    take me away. So we can work with geneticists who understand that. So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks  they found that the diversity was incredibly low. If you look at the first line really  you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar. I think this means basically that they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry. If you look at nucleotide diversity  which is more genetics that are passed on through parents  you can see that basking sharks  if you look at the first study  was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species. And you see that this work was done in     . Before       we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks. We had no idea  did they distinguish into different populations  Were there subpopulations  And of course  that's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals. So Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really. So he did another study using microsatellites  which are much more expensive  much more time consuming  and  to his surprise  came up with almost identical results. So it does seem to be that basking sharks  for some reason  have incredibly low diversity. And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck  a genetic bottleneck thought to be        years ago  and this has caused a very low diversity. And yet  if you look at whale sharks  which is the other plankton eating large shark  its diversity is much greater. So it doesn't really make sense at all. They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks. So even though basking sharks are found throughout the world  you couldn't tell the difference genetically from one from the Pacific  the Atlantic  New Zealand  or from Ireland  South Africa. They all basically seem the same. But again  it's kind of surprising. You wouldn't really expect that. I don't understand this. I don't pretend to understand this. And I suspect most geneticists don't understand it either  but they produce the numbers. So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics. And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size        animals. That's it.       animals in the world. You're thinking   That's just ridiculous. No way.  So Les did a finer study and he found out it came out about      . And using different microsatellites gave the different results. But the average of all these studies came out    the mean is about        which I personally don't believe  but then I am a skeptic. But even if you toss a few numbers around  you're probably talking of an effective population of about        animals. Do you remember how many they killed off Achill there in the   s and the   s  So what it tells us actually is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small. In fact  of those               were thought to be females. There's only       basking shark females in the world  I don't know. I don't believe it. The problem with this is they were constrained with samples. They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail. So where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis  Well one obvious source is dead sharks  Dead sharks washed up. We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year  if we're kind of lucky. Another source would be fisheries bycatch. We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets. That's banned now  and that'll be good news for the sharks. And some are caught in nets  in trawls. This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas  illegally  because you're not allowed to do that under E.U. law  and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak. They even put a recipe up on the wall  until they were told this was illegal. And they actually did get a fine for that. So if you look at all those studies I showed you  the total number of samples worldwide is    at present. So it's very important work  and they can ask some really good questions  and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure  but they're constrained by lack of samples. Now when we were out tagging our sharks  this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB    get in there fast    occasionally the sharks do react. And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal  a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail  more  I think  in startle to the fact that a boat came near it  rather than the tag going in. And that was fine. We got wet. No problem. And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head  to the pier  I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat. And I remembered    I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats    I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind. So I was thinking that must have come from the shark. Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable. And we would use conventional methods    I have a crossbow  you see the crossbow in my hand there  which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well. So I tried that  I tried many techniques. All it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong. There was no way we were going to get a sample from that. So that wasn't going to work. So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat  I thought   If you take what you're given in this world ...  So I scraped it off. And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists. So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen. And I said   You might try that.  And they sat on it for months actually. It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man. But I kept emailing  saying   Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet   And he was like   Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Later  later  later.  Anyway he thought he'd better do it  because I never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him. And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime. And they amplified it and they tested it and they found  yes  this was actually basking shark DNA  which was got from the slime. And so he was all very excited. It became known as Simon's shark slime. And I thought   Hey  you know  I can build on this.  So we thought  okay  we're going to try to get out and get some slime. So having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags  I then thought I'd invest  .      the price is still on it    in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle and even less money on some oven cleaners. And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the end of the mop handle and was desperate  desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks. Now this was into August now  and normally sharks peak at June  July. And you rarely see them. You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August. So we were desperate. So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks. So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat    you see  here's a shark that's running under the boat here    we managed to collect slime. And here it is. Look at that lovely  black shark slime. And in about half an hour  we got five samples  five individual sharks  were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system. I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for    years now  and they're kind of a bit more dramatic. You probably saw the humpback whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off County Wexford. And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind. And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins. But hey  sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come. So this is possibly going to be my legacy    Simon's shark slime. So we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples. And one thing that is kind of very useful is that we use a pole cameras    this is my colleague Joanne with a pole camera    where you can actually look underneath the shark. And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers  which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark. So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark. So if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it  we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female. Because at the moment  they actually have no way genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female  which I found absolutely staggering  because they don't know what primers to look for. And being able to tell the gender of a shark has got very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through societies  because it is illegal to trade any sharks. And they are caught and they are on the market. So as a field biologist  you just want to get encounters with these animals. You want to learn as much as you can. They're often quite brief. They're often very seasonally constrained. And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can. But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines  such as geneticists  who can gain so much more from that. So as I said  these things are sent to you in strange ways. Grab them while you can. I'll take that as my scientific legacy. Hopefully I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die. But for the time being  thank you for that. And keep an eye out for sharks. If you're more interested  we have a basking shark website now just set up. So thank you and thank you for listening. The humanitarian model has barely changed since the early   th century. Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age. And there is a major shift coming on the horizon. The catalyst for this change was the major earthquake that struck Haiti on the   th of January in     . Haiti was a game changer. The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port au Prince  claiming the lives of some         people  rendering homeless about  .  million people. Government institutions were completely decapitated  including the presidential palace. I remember standing on the roof of the Ministry of Justice in downtown Port au Prince. It was about two meters high  completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake. For those of us on the ground in those early days  it was clear for even the most disaster hardened veterans that Haiti was something different. Haiti was something we hadn't seen before. But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented. Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future of what disaster response might look like in a hyper connected world where people have access to mobile smart devices. Because out of the urban devastation in Port au Prince came a torrent of SMS texts    people crying for help  beseeching us for assistance  sharing data  offering support  looking for their loved ones. This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered. We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet  but    percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands. And we were unprepared for this  and they were shaping the aid effort. Outside Haiti also  things were looking different. Tens of thousands of so called digital volunteers were scouring the Internet  converting tweets that had already been converted from texts and putting these into open source maps  layering them with all sorts of important information    people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map    and putting these on the Web for everybody    the media  the aid organizations and the communities themselves    to participate in and to use. Back in Haiti  people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS. People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress  were signaling their need for help. On street sides all over Port au Prince  entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations. They understood more than we did people's innate need to be connected. Never having been confronted with this type of situation before  we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource  how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology. We started talking with a local telecom provider called Voil   which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International. We had basically three requirements. We wanted to communicate in a two way form of communication. We didn't want to shout  we needed to listen as well. We wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities. We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time. And we wanted it to be easy to use. Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA    the Trilogy Emergency Response Application    which has been used to support the aid effort ever since. It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters. It has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters. It's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera. And it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender based violence. But does it work  We have just published an evaluation of this program  and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable. Some    percent of people received the data. Those who were intended to receive the data     percent of them received it.    percent of them found it useful.    percent of them took action    evidence that it is indeed empowering. And    percent of them shared it. The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region. It is a user appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect. Technology is transformational. Right across the developing world  citizens and communities are using technology to enable them to bring about change  positive change  in their own communities. The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models  the old analog models of control and command. One illustration of the transformational power of technology is in Kibera. Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums. It's on the outskirts of Nairobi  the capital city of Kenya. It's home to an unknown number of people    some say between         and  .  million. If you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map  Kibera is represented as a lush  green national park devoid of human settlement. Young people living in Kibera in their community  with simple handheld devices  GPS handheld devices and SMS enabled mobile phones  have literally put themselves on the map. They have collated crowd sourced data and rendered the invisible visible. People like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information  real time information  Tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use. You can find out about the latest impromptu music session. You can find out about the latest security incident. You can find out about places of worship. You can find out about the health centers. You can feel the dynamism of this living  breathing community. They also have their own news network on YouTube with        viewers at the moment. They're showing us what can be done with mobile  digital technologies. They're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible. And they are giving a voice to themselves. They are telling their own story  bypassing the official narrative. And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories. In Mongolia for instance  where    percent of the people are nomadic  SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns. SMS is even used to hold herder summits from remote participation. And if people are migrating into urban  unfamiliar  concrete environments  they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge. In Nigeria  open source SMS tools are being used by the Red Cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria. My colleague  Jason Peat  who runs this program  tells me it's    times faster and    times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things. And not only is it empowering to the communities  but really importantly  this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long term health polices. We are on a planet of seven billion people  five billion mobile subscriptions. By       there will be three billion smartphones in the world. The U.N. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in    percent of the Developing World  compared to    percent today. We are hurtling towards a hyper connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart  fast mobile devices. People are understanding  from Cairo to Oakland  that there are new ways to come together  there are new ways to mobilize  there are new ways to influence. A transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models. The collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing. We need to  for example  embrace the big data  the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data. One idea that I'd like you to consider  for instance  is to take a look at our IT departments. They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers  but they need to be elevated to software strategists. We need people in our organizations who know what it's like to work with big data. We need technology as a core organizational principle. We need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question   What would Amazon or Google do with all of this data   and convert it to humanitarian good. The possibilities that new digital technologies are bringing can help humanitarian organizations  not only ensure that people's right to information is met  or that they have their right to communicate  but I think in the future  humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard  that they're truly participating  that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world. It has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort. We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities. There are no more reasons not to do it. I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world from analog to digital. Thank you very much. The world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world  Canada's boreal forest. It stretches right across northern Canada  in Labrador  it's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world  the George River caribou herd  numbering approximately         animals. Unfortunately  when I was there I couldn't find one of them  but you have the antlers as proof. All across the boreal  we're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems. They're absolutely critical ecosystems  they clean air  they clean water  they sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases  and they're home to a huge diversity of species. In the boreal  they are also the home where almost    percent of the     bird species found in North America migrate north to breed and raise their young. In Ontario  the boreal marches down south to the north shore of Lake Superior. And these incredibly beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history  the Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape  and so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage  but also an important part of our cultural heritage. In Manitoba  this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg  and this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site. In Saskatchewan  as across all of the boreal  home to some of our most famous rivers  an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school age child learns about  the Peace  the Athabasca  the Churchill here  the Mackenzie  and these networks were the historical routes for the voyageur and the coureur des bois  the first non Aboriginal explorers of northern Canada that  taking from the First Nations people  used canoes and paddled to explore for a trade route  a Northwest Passage for the fur trade. In the North  the boreal is bordered by the tundra  and just below that  in Yukon  we have this incredible valley  the Tombstone Valley. And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd. Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Well  the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected  and is potentially  could be potentially  exploited for gas and mineral rights. The western border of the boreal in British Columbia is marked by the Coast Mountains  and on the other side of those mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world  the Great Bear Rainforest  and we'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail. All across the boreal  it's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples  and a rich and varied culture. And I think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past  know their native languages  the songs  the dances  the traditions  I think part of that reason is because of the remoteness  the span and the wilderness of this almost    percent intact ecosystem. And I think particularly now  as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis  we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over        years. In the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we've been talking about  and I think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be Canadians. This is the Alberta tar sands  the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia. Trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern Alberta are these vast reserves of this sticky  tar like bitumen. And the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before. I want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this. If you look at that truck there  it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet. It is a     ton capacity dump truck and its dimensions are    feet long by    feet wide and    feet high. If I stand beside that truck  my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap. Within the dimensions of that truck  you could build a       square foot two story home quite easily. I did the math. So instead of thinking of that as a truck  think of that as a       square foot home. That's not a bad size home. And line those trucks homes back and forth across there from the bottom all the way to the top. And then think of how large that very small section of one mine is. Now  you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well. Now  here you see    of course  as you go further on  these trucks become like a pixel. Again  imagine those all back and forth there. How large is that one portion of a mine  That would be a huge  vast metropolitan area  probably much larger than the city of Victoria. And this is just one of a number of mines     mines so far right now. This is one section of one mining complex  and there are about another    or    in the approval process. No tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval  so it is essentially a rubber stamp. The other method of extraction is what's called the in situ. And here  massive amounts of water are super heated and pumped through the ground  through these vasts networks of pipelines  seismic lines  drill paths  compressor stations. And even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines  it's even more damaging in some ways. It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness  where there is    percent reduction of key species  like woodland caribou and grizzly bears  and it consumes even more energy  more water  and produces at least as much greenhouse gas. So these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines. The oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil. This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil. It's also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest growing single source of carbon in Canada  and it is also a reason why Canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person. The tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet. Oil sands    or rather I should say tar sands     oil sands  is a P.R. created term so that the oil companies wouldn't be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar like substance that's the world's dirtiest oil. So they decided to call it oil sands. The tar sands consume more water than any other oil process  three to five barrels of water are taken  polluted and then returned into tailings ponds  the largest toxic impoundments on the planet. SemCrude  just one of the licensees  in just one of their tailings ponds  dumps         tons of this toxic gunk every single day. That's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet. So far  this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Eerie a foot deep. And the tailings ponds range in size up to       acres. That's two thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan. That's like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan up to maybe    th Street. So this is an absolutely    this is one of the larger tailings ponds. This might be  what  I don't know  half the size of Manhattan. And you can see in the context  it's just a relatively small section of one of    mining complexes and another    to    on stream to be approved soon. And of course  these tailings ponds    well  you can't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these  so maybe we should stop calling them ponds    these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River. And the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of Aboriginal communities. In Fort Chippewa  the     people there  are finding toxins in the food chain  this has been scientifically proven. The tar sands toxins are in the food chain  and this is causing cancer rates up to    times what they are in the rest of Canada. In spite of that  people have to live  have to eat this food in order to survive. The incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern Aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival. And not that many years ago  I was lent a boat by a First Nations man. And he said   When you go out on the river  do not under any circumstances eat the fish. It's carcinogenic.  And yet  on the front porch of that man's cabin  I saw four fish. He had to feed his family to survive. And as a parent  I just can't imagine what that does to your soul. And that's what we're doing. The boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change. The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem. And this is absolutely key. So what we're doing is  we're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink  twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests. And what we're doing is we're destroying this carbon sink  turning it into a carbon bomb. And we're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world  which is producing the most high carbon greenhouse gas emitting oil in the world. And we're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet. This is one of the reasons why Canada  originally a climate change hero    we were one of the first signatories of the Kyoto Accord. Now we're the country that has full time lobbyists in the European Union and Washington  D.C. threatening trade wars when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high carbon fuels  of greenhouse gas emissions  anything like this  at international conferences  whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun  international conferences on climate change  we're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue. Just    miles downstream is the world's largest freshwater delta  the Peace Athabasca Delta  the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways. This is a globally significant wetland  perhaps the greatest on the planet. Incredible habitat for half the bird species you find in North America  migrating here. And also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison  and also  of course  critical habitat for another whole range of other species. But it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca  which feeds these wetlands  and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet  which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream. So as bad as all that is  things are going to get much worse  much  much worse. This is the infrastructure as we see it about now. This is what's planned for     . And you can see here the Keystone Pipeline  which would take tar sands raw down to the Gulf Coast  punching a pipeline through the heart  the agricultural heart of North America  of the United States  and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world by consumption of the United States  and promoting a huge disincentive to a sustainable clean energy future for America. Here you see the route down the Mackenzie Valley. This would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world  and the only one which is    percent intact. And building a pipeline with an industrial highway would change forever this incredible wilderness  which is a true rarity on the planet today. So the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there  within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of     year old trees  maybe    inches across  and soon we're in the coastal temperate rainforest  rain drenched        year old trees     feet across  a completely different ecosystem. And the Great Bear Rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world. Some of the greatest densities of  some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet  and yet there's a proposal  of course  to build a pipeline to take huge tankers     times the size of the Exxon Valdez  through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world  where only just a few years ago  a B.C. ferry ran aground. When one of these tar sands tankers  carrying the dirtiest oil     times as much as the Exxon Valdez  eventually hits a rock and goes down  we're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen. And here we have the plan out to     . What they're proposing is an almost four times increase in production  and that would industrialize an area the size of Florida. In doing so  we'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high greenhouse gas emission oil in the future. The world does not need any more tar mines. The world does not need any more pipelines to wed our addiction to fossil fuels. And the world certainly does not need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities. And let's face it  we all live downstream in an era of global warming and climate change. What we need  is we all need to act to ensure that Canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country. We need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected  and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere. And we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands. And we can do that. There is a huge network all over the world fighting to stop this project. And I quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in Canada. Everyone in this room  everyone across Canada  everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and  I think  a responsibility. Because what we do here is going to change our history  it's going to color our possibility to survive  and for our children to survive and have a rich future. We have an incredible gift in the boreal  an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming  but we could let that slip away. The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal. It compromises the life and the health of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people  the Aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us. It could destroy the Athabasca Delta  the largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet. It could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest  the largest temperate rainforest in the world. And it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland of North America. I hope that you will all  if you've been moved by this presentation  join with the growing international community to get Canada to step up to its responsibilities  to convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion instead of a climate change villain  and to say no to the tar sands  and yes to a clean energy future for all. Thank you so much. The things we make have one supreme quality    they live longer than us. We perish  they survive  we have one life  they have many lives  and in each life they can mean different things. Which means that  while we all have one biography  they have many. I want this morning to talk about the story  the biography    or rather the biographies    of one particular object  one remarkable thing. It doesn't  I agree  look very much. It's about the size of a rugby ball. It's made of clay  and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape  covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun. And as you can see  it's been knocked about a bit  which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in     . But today  this thing is  I believe  a major player in the politics of the Middle East. And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet. The story begins in the Iran Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces  the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change. And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with  Belshazzar's feast    because we're talking about the Iran Iraq war of     BC. And the parallels between the events of     BC and      and in between are startling. What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting  now in the National Gallery in London  illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures. And you all know roughly the story. Belshazzar  the son of Nebuchadnezzar  Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel  sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon. Not only the Jews  he'd taken the temple vessels. He'd ransacked  desecrated the temple. And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon. Belshazzar  his son  decides to have a feast. And in order to make it even more exciting  he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun  and he brings out the temple vessels. He's already at war with the Iranians  with the king of Persia. And that night  Daniel tells us  at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall   You are weighed in the balance and found wanting  and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians.  And that very night Cyrus  king of the Persians  entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell. It is  of course  a great moment in the history of the Jewish people. It's a great story. It's story we all know.  The writing on the wall  is part of our everyday language. What happened next was remarkable  and it's where our cylinder enters the story. Cyrus  king of the Persians  has entered Babylon without a fight    the great empire of Babylon  which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean  falls to Cyrus. And Cyrus makes a declaration. And that is what this cylinder is  the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people. In ringing Babylonian    it was written in Babylonian    he says   I am Cyrus  king of all the universe  the great king  the powerful king  king of Babylon  king of the four quarters of the world.  They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see. This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we've got. And it's written  as we'll see in due course  by very skilled P.R. consultants. So the hyperbole is not actually surprising. And what is the great king  the powerful king  the king of the four quarters of the world going to do  He goes on to say that  having conquered Babylon  he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians    Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar    have captured and enslaved go free. He'll let them return to their countries. And more important  he will let them all recover the gods  the statues  the temple vessels that had been confiscated. All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home  and they'll take with them their gods. And they'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way  in their own place. This is the decree  this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews  after the exile in Babylon  the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon  weeping when they remembered Jerusalem  those Jews were allowed to go home. They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple. It's a central document in Jewish history. And the Book of Chronicles  the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms. This is the Jewish version of the same story.  Thus said Cyrus  king of Persia  'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee  and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem. Who is there among you of his people  The Lord God be with him  and let him go up.'   Go up     aaleh. The central element  still  of the notion of return  a central part of the life of Judaism. As you all know  that return from exile  the second temple  reshaped Judaism. And that change  that great historic moment  was made possible by Cyrus  the king of Persia  reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay. Two great texts  what about the politics  What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history. The empire of Iran  the Medes and the Persians  united under Cyrus  became the first great world empire. Cyrus begins in the    s BC. And by the time of his son Darius  the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control. This empire is  in fact  the Middle East as we now know it  and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it. It was the largest empire the world had known until then. Much more important  it was the first multicultural  multifaith state on a huge scale. And it had to be run in a quite new way. It had to be run in different languages. The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing. And it had to recognize their different habits  different peoples  different religions  different faiths. All of those are respected by Cyrus. Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational  multifaith  multicultural society. And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen  and which survived for     years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander. It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit  and a unit where people of different faiths could live together. The Greek invasions ended that. And of course  Alexander couldn't sustain a government and it fragmented. But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central. The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book  Cyropaedia  promoting Cyrus as the great ruler. And throughout European culture afterward  Cyrus remained the model. This is a   th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was. And Xenophon's book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. Jefferson was a great admirer    the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those   th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state. Meanwhile  back in Babylon  things had not been going well. After Alexander  the other empires  Babylon declines  falls into ruins  and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost    until      when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon. And it enters now another story. It enters that great debate in the middle of the   th century  Are the scriptures reliable  Can we trust them  We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures. No other evidence. Suddenly  this appeared. And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution  by geology  here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true. It's a great   th century moment. But    and this  of course  is where it becomes complicated    the facts were true  hurrah for archeology  but the interpretation was rather more complicated. Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect. The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon  Marduk. And  not surprisingly  they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.  Marduk  we hold  called Cyrus by his name.  Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand  calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon. Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great  generous things of setting the people free. And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk. The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament  you will not be surprised to learn  take a rather different view of this. For them  of course  it can't possibly by Marduk that made all this happen. It can only be Jehovah. And so in Isaiah  we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this  not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel    the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name  also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people. It's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event  two different religious takeovers of a political fact. God  we know  is usually on the side of the big battalions. The question is  which god was it  And the debate unsettles everybody in the   th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion. And it's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah  and yet  Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk. And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this  because he says  this is God speaking  of course   I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me.  I think it's recognized that Cyrus doesn't realize that he's acting under orders from Jehovah. And equally  he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk. Because interestingly  of course  Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts. That's     .    years on and we're in       and the cylinder enters a different world. This time  the real politics of the contemporary world    the year of the Balfour Declaration  the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East  Britain  decides that it will declare a Jewish national home  it will allow the Jews to return. And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic. And across Eastern Europe  Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side    the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem. And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in      is part of a divine plan. You all know what happened. The state of Israel is setup  and    years later  in the late   s  it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over. And another story of the cylinder begins. The region  the U.K. and the U.S. decide  has to be kept safe from communism  and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran  the Shah. And so the Shah invents an Iranian history  or a return to Iranian history  that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder. When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis  he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum  goes to Tehran  and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty. Cyrus cylinder  guarantor of the Shah.    years later  another story  Iranian Revolution      . Islamic revolution  no more Cyrus  we're not interested in that history  we're interested in Islamic Iran    until Iraq  the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region  attacks. Then another Iran Iraq war. And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past  their great past when they fought Iraq and won. It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians    Muslims and non Muslims  Christians  Zoroastrians  Jews living in Iran  people who are devout  not devout. And the obvious emblem is Cyrus. So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together  as we've been doing  the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan. It's the only object they want. They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder. And last year  the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time. It's shown being presented here  put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran  one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions  Mrs. Ardakani. It was a huge event. This is the other side of that same picture. It's seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months. This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West. And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means  what Cyrus means  but above all  Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder    Cyrus as the defender of the homeland  the champion  of course  of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples  tolerant of all faiths. And in the current Iran  Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament  something to be very  very proud of. To see this object in Tehran  thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it. It became a great emblem  a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad. Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed  Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated  This is heady national rhetoric  and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return. Here you see this out sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran. It was a narrative presented by the president himself. And for me  to take this object to Iran  to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is  what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today. It's a debate that's still continuing  and it will continue to rumble  because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration. It stands with the American constitution. It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta. It is a document that can mean so many things  for Iran and for the region. A replica of this is at the United Nations. In New York this autumn  it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place. And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures. It will appear  certainly  in many more Middle Eastern stories. And what story of the Middle East  what story of the world  do you want to see reflecting what is said  what is expressed in this cylinder  The right of peoples to live together in the same state  worshiping differently  freely    a Middle East  a world  in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate. In the world of the Middle East at the moment  the debates are  as you know  shrill. But I think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing  the Cyrus cylinder. Thank you. Gabriel Garc a M rquez is one of my favorite writers  for his storytelling  but even more  I think  for the beauty and precision of his prose. And whether it's the opening line from  One Hundred Years of Solitude  or the fantastical stream of consciousness in  Autumn of the Patriarch   where the words rush by  page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal South American jungle  reading M rquez is a visceral experience. Which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when I realized that I was being swept along on this remarkable  vivid journey in translation. Now I was a comparative literature major in college  which is like an English major  only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months  we got to read great literature in translation from around the world. And as great as these books were  you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect. But not so with M rquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own  which is an astonishing compliment. So when I heard that the translator  Gregory Rabassa  had written his own book on the subject  I couldn't wait to read it. It's called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward   If This Be Treason.  And it's a charming read. It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art. But the reason that I mention it is that early on  Rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight   Every act of communication is an act of translation.  Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time  but for me  as often as I'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis  I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light. Ever since I can remember thinking consciously about such things  communication has been my central passion. Even as a child  I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else. So no ego problems. It's funny  my wife  Daisy  whose family is littered with schizophrenics    and I mean littered with them    once said to me   Chris  I already have a brother who thinks he's God. I don't need a husband who wants to be.  Anyway  as I plunged through my   s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was  it was that second part  being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge I was gaining  where the futility of my quest really set in. Time after time  whenever I set out to share some great truth with a soon to be grateful recipient  it had the opposite effect. Interestingly  when your opening line of communication is   Hey  listen up  because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you   it's amazing how quickly you'll discover both ice and the firing squad. Finally  after about    years of alienating friends and strangers alike  I finally got it  a new personal truth all my own  that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that I was gaining  I'd better find a different way of going about it. And that's when I discovered comedy. Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language. If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum  I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies. And I'm not talking about all comedy here  because  clearly  there's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel. What I want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives    comedy as the philosopher's stone. It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world. Because that's what I take from the theme of this conference  Gained in Translation. That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual  but leads to real change. Which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self interest. Now I'm big on speaking to people's self interest because we're all wired for that. It's part of our survival package  and that's why it's become so important for us  and that's why we're always listening at that level. And also because that's where  in terms of our own self interest  we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond  our responsibility to the rest of the world. Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire  I mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity. Now if you think back on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin  they were devastating. Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness  cementing an impression that the majority of the American public still holds today. And the key detail of this is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her and they weren't written by the SNL writers. They were lifted verbatim from Palin's own remarks. Here was a Palin impersonator quoting Palin word for word. Now that's honesty and integrity  and it's also why Fey's performances left such a lasting impression. On the other side of the political spectrum  the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl I knew that he'd made a direct hit. Now it's not often that I'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh  but it's really hard to argue with that punchline. The description perfectly captured Edwards' personal vanity. And guess what  That ended up being the exact personality trait that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career. Now The Daily Show with John Stewart is by far the most    it's by far the most well documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy. Survey after survey  from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy  has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows. Now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers  the larger point remains that Stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts    not because his intent is to inform. It's not. His intent is to be funny. It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true. And the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media. Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection. A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick  where you think it's going over here and then all of a sudden you're transported over here. And there's this mental delight that's followed by the physical response of laughter  which  not coincidentally  releases endorphins in the brain. And just like that  you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses. This is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic  all of the flight or fight responses  operate. Flight or fight releases adrenalin  which throws our walls up sky high. And the comedy comes along  dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest    race  religion  politics  sexuality    only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin  we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows  revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view. Now let me give you an example from my act. I have some material about the so called radical gay agenda  which starts off by asking  how radical is the gay agenda  Because from what I can tell  the three things gay Americans seem to want most are to join the military  get married and start a family. Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life. Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours. And that's followed by these lines about gay adoption  What is the problem with gay adoption  Why is this remotely controversial  If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay  you should be allowed to put it up for adoption. You have given birth to an abomination. Remove it from your household. Now by taking the biblical epithet  abomination  and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence  a baby  this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity  through their laughter  to question its validity. Misdirection isn't the only trick that comedy has up its sleeve. Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy. There are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline. Bill Hicks    and if you don't know his work  you should really Google him    Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground  where finally the other kid says to him   Huh  Well my dad can beat up your dad   to which Hicks replies   Really  How soon   That's an entire childhood in three words. Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them. And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it's inherently viral. People can't wait to pass along that new great joke. And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world. Comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the Internet  social media  even cable TV. Back in      when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident  I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that. And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts    something about the Ignited Negro College Fund. Clearly  it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue. And my guess here    and I have no research on this    is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it  you'd find out that comedy is the second oldest viral profession. First there were drums and then knock knock jokes. But it's when you put all of these elements together    when you get the viral appeal of a great joke with a powerful punchline that's crafted from honesty and integrity  it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation. Now I have a close friend  Joel Pett  who's the editorial cartoonist for the Lexington Herald Leader. And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy. I was visiting with Joel the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened in December of     . And Joel was explaining to me that  because USA Today was one of America's four papers of record  it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference  which meant that  if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on Monday  the opening day of the conference  it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision makers. So we started talking about climate change. And it turned out that Joel and I were both bothered by the same thing  which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or wasn't  which  to both of us  seems somewhat intentionally off point. Because first of all  there's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists. Now Governor Perry of my newly adopted state of Texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops fated campaign for the Republican presidential nomination  proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete at the same time that     out of     counties in the state of Texas were on fire. And Perry's policy solution was to ask the people of Texas to pray for rain. Personally  I was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science. But back in       the question Joel and I kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science. So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this. Cartoon   What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing   You've got to love that idea. How about that  How about we create a better world for nothing  Not for God  not for country  not for profit    just as a basic metric for global decision making. And this cartoon hit the bull's eye. Shortly after the conference was over  Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on. And not long after that  he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year. And it didn't stop there. To date  Joel's gotten requests from over    environmental groups  in the United States  Canada and Europe. And earlier this year  he got a request from the Green Party in Australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the Australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world. That is a lot of punch for    words. So my suggestion to those of you out here who are seriously focused on creating a better world is to take a little bit of time each day and practice thinking funny  because you might just find the question that you've been looking for. Thank you. My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago. I was in the desert  under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali. And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic  The Mahabharata.  So back in the day  when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. Now we do the same with airplanes. Back then  when Arjuna  the great Indian warrior prince  when he was thirsty  he'd take out a bow  he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out. Now we do the same with drills and machines. The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery. And this made me really sad. I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me  without tweeting it to my friends. And it felt like technology should enable magic  not kill it. When I was a little girl  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch. And this piece of    year old technology became the most magical thing to me. It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination. So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming. They stopped us from being inspired. And so I jumped in  I jumped into this world of technology  to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it. I've been illustrating books since I was   . And so when I saw the iPad  I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world. It can know how we're holding it. It can know where we are. It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch. Storytelling is becoming more and more multi sensorial. But what are we doing with it  So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya  an interactive app for the iPad. So it says   Place your fingers upon each light.  And so    It says   This box belongs to ...   And so I type in my name. And actually I become a character in the book. At various points  a little letter drops down to me    and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS    which is actually addressed to me. The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities. Now I've been talking a lot about magic. And I don't mean wizards and dragons  I mean the kind of childhood magic  those ideas that we all harbored as children. This idea of fireflies in a jar  for some reason  was always really exciting to me. And so over here you need to tilt your iPad  take the fireflies out. And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble. And so over here  each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device. And it opens up a map. All along  all fantasy books have always had maps  but these maps have been static. This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book. It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well. So I'm just going to enter in. Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary. Over here  these are the Apsaras. So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs  but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts  the Apsaras  These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book. And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children. And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis. Speaking of the environmental crisis  I think a big problem has been in the last    years is that children have been locked inside their rooms  glued to their PCs  they haven't been able to get out. But now with mobile technology  we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology. One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside  take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects. When I was a child  I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells. And somehow kids don't do that anymore. So in bringing back this childhood ritual  you need to go out and  in one chapter  take a picture of a flower and then tag it. In another chapter  you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that. And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online. A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says   Oh  I saw a fox today.  A child in India says   I saw a monkey today.  And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken. In the possibilities of linking together magic  the earth and technology  there are multiple possibilities. In the next book  we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality  you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house. At one point  your screen is filled up with leaves. And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book. We're moving  we're all moving here  to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology  and magic and technology can come closer together. We're harnessing energy from the sun. We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story. Thank you. I'm going to talk today about saving more  but not today  tomorrow. I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow. It's a program that Richard Thaler from the University of Chicago and I devised maybe    years ago. The program  in a sense  is an example of behavioral finance on steroids    how we could really use behavioral finance. Now you might ask  what is behavioral finance  So let's think about how we manage our money. Let's start with mortgages. It's kind of a recent topic  at least in the U.S. A lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford  and actually slightly bigger than that. And then they foreclose. And then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages. Let's also think about how we manage risks    for example  investing in the stock market. Two years ago  three years ago  about four years ago  markets did well. We were risk takers  of course. Then market stocks seize and we're like   Wow. These losses  they feel  emotionally  they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up.  So we're probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking. How many of you have iPhones  Anyone  Wonderful. I would bet many more of you insure your iPhone    you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty. What if you lose your iPhone  What if you do this  How many of you have kids  Anyone  Keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance. I see a lot of hands coming down. I would predict  if you're a representative sample  that many more of you insure your iPhones than your lives  even when you have kids. We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance. The average American household spends       dollars a year on lotteries. And I know it sounds crazy. How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries  No one. So that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand to get the average to a thousand. Low income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries. So where does it take us  We're not doing a great job managing money. Behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics  trying to understand the money mistakes people make. And I can keep standing here for the    minutes and    seconds that I have left and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money  and at the end you're going to ask   How can we help people   And that's what I really want to focus on today. How do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make  and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions  And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow. I want to address the issue of savings. We have on the screen a representative sample of     Americans. And we're going to look at their saving behavior. First thing to notice is  half of them do not even have access to a     k  plan. They cannot make savings easy. They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a     k  plan before they see it  before they can touch it. What about the remaining half of the people  Some of them elect not to save. They're just too lazy. They never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing    clicks to join the     k  plan. And then they have to decide how they're going to invest in their    choices  and they never heard about what is a money market fund. And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join. How many people end up saving to a     k  plan  One third of Americans. Two thirds are not saving now. Are they saving enough  Take out those who say they save too little. One out of    are saving enough. Nine out of    either cannot save through their     k  plan  decide not to save    or don't decide    or save too little. We think we have a problem of people saving too much. Let's look at that. We have one person    well  actually we're going to slice him in half because it's less than one percent. Roughly half a percent of Americans feel that they save too much. What are we going to do about it  That's what I really want to focus on. We have to understand why people are not saving  and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions  and then see how powerful it might be. So let me divert for a second as we're going to identify the problems  the challenges  the behavioral challenges  that prevent people from saving. I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate. Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week. And during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate. How many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical TED event next week  Who would go for bananas  Wonderful. I predict scientifically    percent of you will go for bananas. Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted. And then count down the days and see what people ended up eating. The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later. Self control is not a problem in the future. It's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us. What does it have to do with time and savings  this issue of immediate gratification  Or as some economists call it  present bias. We think about saving. We know we should be saving. We know we'll do it next year  but today let us go and spend. Christmas is coming  we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know. So this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving  but end up spending. Let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia. But again  a little diversion to the topic of organ donation. Wonderful study comparing different countries. We're going to look at two similar countries  Germany and Austria. And in Germany  if you would like to donate your organs    God forbid something really bad happens to you    when you get your driving license or an I.D.  you check the box saying   I would like to donate my organs.  Not many people like checking boxes. It takes effort. You need to think. Twelve percent do. Austria  a neighboring country  slightly similar  slightly different. What's the difference  Well  you still have choice. You will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not. But when you get your driving license  you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ. Nobody checks boxes. That's kind of too much effort. One percent check the box. The rest do nothing. Doing nothing is very common. Not many people check boxes. What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available  In Germany     percent check the box. Twelve percent are organ donors. Huge shortage of organs  God forbid  if you need one. In Austria  again  nobody checks the box. Therefore     percent of people are organ donors. Inertia  lack of action. What is the default setting if people do nothing  if they keep procrastinating  if they don't check the boxes  Very powerful. We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their     k  choices. Are we going to make them automatically join the plan  or are they going to be left out  In too many     k  plans  if people do nothing  it means they're not saving for retirement  if they don't check the box. And checking the box takes effort. So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges. One more before we flip the challenges into solutions  having to do with monkeys and apples. No  no  no  this is a real study and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics. One group of monkeys gets an apple  they're pretty happy. The other group gets two apples  one is taken away. They still have an apple left. They're really mad. Why have you taken our apple  This is the notion of loss aversion. We hate losing stuff  even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk. You would hate to go to the ATM  take out     dollars and notice that you lost one of those     bills. It's very painful  even though it doesn't mean anything. Those    dollars might have been a quick lunch. So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too  because people  mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending. So we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with savings eventually. Whether you think about immediate gratification  and the chocolates versus bananas  it's just painful to save now. It's a lot more fun to spend now. We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box. If people have to check a lot of boxes to join a     k  plan  they're going to keep procrastinating and not join. And last  we talked about loss aversion  and the monkeys and the apples. If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss  they're not going to be saving for retirement. So we've got these challenges  and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by    take behavioral finance  make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance  .  or behavioral finance in action    flip the challenges into solutions. And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called Save More  not today  Tomorrow. How is it going to solve the challenges we chatted about  If you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates  we think we're going to eat bananas next week. We think we're going to save more next year. Save More Tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year    sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas  volunteering more in the community  exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet. Now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action. Save More Tomorrow makes it easy. It's an autopilot. Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future  let's say every January you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the     k  plan before you see it  before you touch it  before you get the issue of immediate gratification. But what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion  Next January comes and people might feel that if they save more  they have to spend less  and that's painful. Well  maybe it shouldn't be just January. Maybe we should make people save more when they make more money. That way  when they make more money  when they get a pay raise  they don't have to cut their spending. They take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more    take a little bit of the increase and put it in a     k  plan. So that is the program  embarrassingly simple  but as we're going to see  extremely powerful. We first implemented it  Richard Thaler and I  back in     . Mid sized company in the Midwest  blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away. Saving more today is not an option. We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise. And here are the results. We're seeing here a three and a half year period  four pay raises  people who were struggling to save  were saving three percent of their paycheck  three and a half years later saving almost four times as much  almost    percent. And there's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because I don't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum. I want  really  to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford. It's real. It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. Whereas with saving three percent  people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk  because they won't be able to afford anything else  when they save    percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive. This is a real difference. By now  about    percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place. It's been part of the Pension Protection Act. And needless to say that Thaler and I have been blessed to be part of this program and make a difference. Let me wrap with two key messages. One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful. This is just one example. Message two is there's still a lot to do. This is really the tip of the iceberg. If you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it  we need to think about that. If you're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they're taking or taking too little risk  we need to think about that. If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets  we need to think about that. The average actually  the record is in Singapore. The average household spends        a year on lottery tickets. We've got a lot to do  a lot to solve  also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement. One last question  How many of you feel comfortable that as you're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan when you're going to retire  when you're going to claim Social Security benefits  what lifestyle to expect  how much to spend every month so you're not going to run out of money  How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post retirement decisions. One  two  three  four. Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience. Behavioral finance has a long way. There's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again. Thank you. How can I speak in    minutes about the bonds of women over three generations  about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four year old girl huddled with her young sister  her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than    years ago  bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go    that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today  This is not a finished story. It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together. Let me tell you about some of the pieces. Imagine the first piece  a man burning his life's work. He is a poet  a playwright  a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom. Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon  confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste. Words  for so long his friends  now mocked him. He retreated into silence. He died broken by history. He is my grandfather. I never knew him in real life. But our lives are much more than our memories. My grandmother never let me forget his life. My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain  and my lesson was to learn that  yes  history tried to crush us  but we endured. The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea. My mother  Mai  was    when her father died    already in an arranged marriage  already with two small girls. For her  life had distilled itself into one task  the escape of her family and a new life in Australia. It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed. So after a four year saga that defies fiction  a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel. All the adults knew the risks. The greatest fear was of pirates  rape and death. Like most adults on the boat  my mother carried a small bottle of poison. If we were captured  first my sister and I  then she and my grandmother would drink. My first memories are from the boat    the steady beat of the engine  the bow dipping into each wave  the vast and empty horizon. I don't remember the pirates who came many times  but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat  or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died  the journey's end too much for him  and the first apple I tasted  given to me by the men on the rig. No apple has ever tasted the same. After three months in a refugee camp  we landed in Melbourne. And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together. We settled in Footscray  a working class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants. Unlike the settled middle class suburbs  whose existence I was oblivious of  there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray. The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world. And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common  they were starting again. My mother worked on farms  then on a car assembly line  working six days  double shifts. Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications. We were poor. All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out  which was usually new clothes  they were always secondhand. Two pairs of stockings for school  each to hide the holes in the other. A school uniform down to the ankles  because it had to last for six years. And there were rare but searing chants of  slit eye  and the occasional graffiti   Asian  go home.  Go home to where  Something stiffened inside me. There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying   I will bypass you.  My mother  my sister and I slept in the same bed. My mother was exhausted each night  but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house. My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat. And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her. She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business. And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition  angry and inflexible  and troubled children caught between two worlds. Grants and sponsors were sought. Centers were established. I lived in parallel worlds. In one  I was the classic Asian student  relentless in the demands that I made on myself. In the other  I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious  tragically scarred by violence  drug abuse and isolation. But so many over the years were helped. And for that work  when I was a final year law student  I was chosen as the young Australian of the year. And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another  and their edges didn't fit. Tan Le  anonymous Footscray resident  was now Tan Le  refugee and social activist  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined. I didn't know the protocols. I didn't know how to use the cutlery. I didn't know how to talk about wine. I didn't know how to talk about anything. I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb    a grandmother  a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost    years  telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep  the three of us still in the same bed. I told my mother I couldn't do it. She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. No had never been an option.  Just do it   she said   and don't be what you're not.  So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. And the more candidly I spoke  the more I was asked to speak. I met people from all walks of life  so many of them doing the thing they loved  living on the frontiers of possibility. And even though I finished my degree  I realized I could not settle into a career in law. There had to be another piece of the jigsaw. And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider  a recent arrival  new on the scene    and not just okay  but something to be thankful for  perhaps a gift from the boat. Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons  can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province. I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that  yes  the world does fall apart  but not in the way that you fear. Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged. There was an energy there  an implacable optimism  a strange mixture of humility and daring. So I followed my hunches. I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label  It can't be done  was an irresistible challenge. For a year we were penniless. At the end of each day  I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared. We worked well into each night. Most of our ideas were crazy  but a few were brilliant  and we broke through. I made the decision to move to the U.S. after only one trip. My hunches again. Three months later I had relocated  and the adventure has continued. Before I close though  let me tell you about my grandmother. She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered. Life hadn't changed for centuries. Her father died soon after she was born. Her mother raised her alone. At    she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her. With no support from her husband  she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case  and a far greater sensation when she won.  It can't be done  was shown to be wrong. I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died     miles away in Melbourne. I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side. I knew she had come to say goodbye. My mother phoned minutes later. A few days later  we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket. We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her. At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket. My mother asked us to feel her hand. She asked the monk   Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold    Because you have been holding it since this morning   he said.  You have not let it go.  If there is a sinew in our family  it runs through the women. Given who we were and how life had shaped us  we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us. Defeat would have come too easily. Now I would like to have my own children  and I wonder about the boat. Who could ever wish it on their own  Yet I am afraid of privilege  of ease  of entitlement. Can I give them a bow in their lives  dipping bravely into each wave  the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine  the vast horizon that guarantees nothing  I don't know. But if I could give it and still see them safely through  I would. Trevor Neilson  And also  Tan's mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row. I'm a computer science professor  and my area of expertise is computer and information security. When I was in graduate school  I had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother describing to one of her fellow senior citizens what I did for a living. Apparently  I was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university.  Laughter  And  you know  that's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think  because I told her I was working in computer security  and it was interesting to get her perspective. But that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard anyone say about my work. The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is  I was at a dinner party  and a woman heard that I work in computer security  and she asked me if    she said her computer had been infected by a virus  and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it  that she could get this virus.  Laughter  And I'm not a doctor  but I reassured her that it was very  very unlikely that this would happen  but if she felt more comfortable  she could be free to use latex gloves when she was on the computer  and there would be no harm whatsoever in that. I'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer  in a serious way. What I'm going to talk to you about today are some hacks  some real world cyberattacks that people in my community  the academic research community  have performed  which I don't think most people know about  and I think they're very interesting and scary  and this talk is kind of a greatest hits of the academic security community's hacks. None of the work is my work. It's all work that my colleagues have done  and I actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk. So the first one I'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices. Now medical devices have come a long way technologically. You can see in      the first pacemaker was invented.       the first internal pacemaker was implanted  hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there  and the technology has continued to move forward. In       we hit an important milestone from the perspective of computer security. And why do I say that  Because that's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities. One thing that brings us close to home is we look at Dick Cheney's device  he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart  and as you can see at the bottom there  it was controlled by a computer controller  and if you ever thought that software liability was very important  get one of these inside of you. Now what a research team did was they got their hands on what's called an ICD. This is a defibrillator  and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm  and these have saved many lives. Well  in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it  they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly  and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol  and they built the device you see pictured here  with a little antenna  that could talk the protocol to the device  and thus control it. In order to make their experience real    they were unable to find any volunteers  and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being's area where the device would go  and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically. They launched many  many successful attacks. One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name. I don't know why you would want to do that  but I sure wouldn't want that done to me. And they were able to change therapies  including disabling the device    and this is with a real  commercial  off the shelf device    simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it. There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs could actually have their performance disrupted simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them. Now  wireless and the Internet can improve health care greatly. There's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside of people  and all of these devices now  it's standard that they communicate wirelessly  and I think this is great  but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing  and without understanding what attackers can do and the security risks from the beginning  there's a lot of danger in this. Okay  let me shift gears and show you another target. I'm going to show you a few different targets like this  and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles. This is a car  and it has a lot of components  a lot of electronics in it today. In fact  it's got many  many different computers inside of it  more Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college  and they're connected by a wired network. There's also a wireless network in the car  which can be reached from many different ways. So there's Bluetooth  there's the FM and XM radio  there's actually wi fi  there's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board. The modern car is a sophisticated multi computer device. And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this  Well  that's what the researchers that I'm going to talk about today did. They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network. Now  they have two areas they can attack. One is short range wireless  where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby  either through Bluetooth or wi fi  and the other is long range  where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network  or through one of the radio stations. Think about it. When a car receives a radio signal  it's processed by software. That software has to receive and decode the radio signal  and then figure out what to do with it  even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio  and that software that does that decoding  if it has any bugs in it  could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car. The way that the researchers did this work is  they read the software in the computer chips that were in the car  and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did  and then they found vulnerabilities in that software  and then they built exploits to exploit those. They actually carried out their attack in real life. They bought two cars  and I guess they have better budgets than I do. The first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got access to the internal network on the car. Okay  so think of that as  someone gets to go to your car  they get to mess around with it  and then they leave  and now  what kind of trouble are you in  The other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular  or something like that  never having actually gotten physical access to your car. This is what their setup looks like for the first model  where you get to have access to the car. They put a laptop  and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network  and they did all kinds of silly things  like here's a picture of the speedometer showing     miles an hour when the car's in park. Once you have control of the car's computers  you can do anything. Now you might say   Okay  that's silly.  Well  what if you make the car always say it's going    miles an hour slower than it's actually going  You might produce a lot of speeding tickets. Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars  the target victim car and the chase car  and they launched a bunch of other attacks. One of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car  simply by hacking the computer. They were able to disable the brakes. They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like going over    miles an hour  or something like that. The results are astonishing  and when they gave this talk  even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers  everybody was gasping. They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car  the brakes computer  the lighting computer  the engine  the dash  the radio  etc.  and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network. They were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car. All of these were implemented successfully. How would you steal a car in this model  Well  you compromise the car by a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software  something like that. You use the GPS in the car to locate it. You remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that  start the engine  bypass anti theft  and you've got yourself a car. Surveillance was really interesting. The authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car  and listening in on the car while tracking it via GPS on a map  and so that's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening. Am I scaring you yet  I've got a few more of these interesting ones. These are ones where I went to a conference  and my mind was just blown  and I said   I have to share this with other people.  This was Fabian Monrose's lab at the University of North Carolina  and what they did was something intuitive once you see it  but kind of surprising. They videotaped people on a bus  and then they post processed the video. What you see here in number one is a reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone that they're typing in. They wrote software to stabilize    even though they were on a bus and maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle    to stabilize the phone  process it  and you may know on your smartphone  when you type a password  the keys pop out a little bit  and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing  and had a language model for detecting typing. What was interesting is  by videotaping on a bus  they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing  and then they had a surprising result  which is that their software had not only done it for their target  but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture  they were able to produce what those people had been typing  and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their software was doing. I'll show you two more. One is P   radios. P   radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate  and there's an encryption option on these phones. This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone. It's more of a two way radio. Motorola makes the most widely used one  and you can see that they're used by Secret Service  they're used in combat  it's a very  very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere. So one question the researchers asked themselves is  could you block this thing  right  Could you run a denial of service  because these are first responders  So  would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency  They found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the P    and they built what they called My First Jammer.  Laughter  If you look closely at this device  it's got a switch for encryption or cleartext. Let me advance the slide  and now I'll go back. You see the difference  This is plain text. This is encrypted. There's one little dot that shows up on the screen  and one little tiny turn of the switch. And so the researchers asked themselves   I wonder how many times very secure  important  sensitive conversations are happening on these two way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt   So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the P    and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in. If they found encrypted communication  they stayed on that channel and they wrote down  that's a channel that these people communicate in  these law enforcement agencies  and they went to    metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies. They found that in every metropolitan area  they would capture over    minutes a day of cleartext communication. And what kind of things were people talking about  Well  they found the names and information about confidential informants. They found information that was being recorded in wiretaps  a bunch of crimes that were being discussed  sensitive information. It was mostly law enforcement and criminal. They went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies  after anonymizing it  and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn't good enough. If you're talking about something really secure and sensitive  it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted. That one's pretty easy to fix. The last one I thought was really  really cool  and I just had to show it to you  it's probably not something that you're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators  but it's stealing keystrokes. Now  we've all looked at smartphones upside down. Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone  and we tend to look at the USB port  the GPS for tracking  the camera  the microphone  but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer. The accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical orientation of the smartphone. And so they had a simple setup. They put a smartphone next to a keyboard  and they had people type  and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing to measure the change in the accelerometer reading to determine what the person had been typing. Now  when they tried this on an iPhone  GS  this is a graph of the perturbations that were created by the typing  and you can see that it's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing  but the iPhone   greatly improved the accelerometer  and so the same measurement produced this graph. Now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing  and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning to have a training phase  and so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things  and to learn  to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer. And then there's the attack phase  where you get somebody to type something in  you don't know what it was  but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing. They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today. They typed in   The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago    see  I tied it in to the last talk    and ordered him to stay on the ballot.  Now  the system is interesting  because it produced  Illinois Supreme  and then it wasn't sure. The model produced a bunch of options  and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques  is that computers are good at some things  humans are good at other things  take the best of both and let the humans solve this one. Don't waste computer cycles. A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might. It's the Supreme Court  right  And so  together we're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer. Why does this matter  Well  in the Android platform  for example  the developers have a manifest where every device on there  the microphone  etc.  has to register if you're going to use it so that hackers can't take over it  but nobody controls the accelerometer. So what's the point  You can leave your iPhone next to someone's keyboard  and just leave the room  and then later recover what they did  even without using the microphone. If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone  they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard. There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately I don't have time to go into  but the one that I wanted to point out was a group from the University of Michigan which was able to take voting machines  the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that were going to be used in New Jersey in the election that were left in a hallway  and put Pac Man on it. So they ran the Pac Man game. What does this all mean  Well  I think that society tends to adopt technology really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget. But it's very important  and these researchers are showing  that the developers of these things need to take security into account from the very beginning  and need to realize that they may have a threat model  but the attackers may not be nice enough to limit themselves to that threat model  and so you need to think outside of the box. What we can do is be aware that devices can be compromised  and anything that has software in it is going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs. Thank you very much.  Applause  Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca  I'm the trends manager at YouTube  and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars    celebrities  singers  comedians    and when I was younger  that seemed so very  very hard to do. But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture. Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday. But there are over    hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. And of that  only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. So how does it happen  Three things  tastemakers  communities of participation and unexpectedness. All right  let's go. Oh  my God  Wooo  Ohhhhh  wowwww  KA  Last year  Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In       it was viewed    million times. This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer. But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video  Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January. So what happened here  Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.   Everybody's looking forward to the weekend  weekend.     Friday  Friday. Gettin' down on Friday.   KA  So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope. Rebecca Black's  Friday  is one of the most popular videos of the year. It's been seen nearly     million times this year. This is a chart of what it looked like. And similar to  Double Rainbow   it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. So what happened on this day  Well it was a Friday  this is true. And if you're wondering about those other spikes  those are also Fridays. But what about this day  this one particular Friday  Well Tosh.  picked it up  a lot of blogs starting writing about. Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience  accelerating the process. And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it. And now there are        parodies of  Friday  on YouTube. Even in the first seven days  there was one parody for every other day of the week. Unlike the one way entertainment of the   th century  this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon    either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. So  Nyan Cat  is a looped animation with looped music. It's this  just like this. It's been viewed nearly    million times this year. And if you think that that is weird  you should know that there is a three hour version of this that's been viewed four million times. Even cats were watching this video. Cats were watching other cats watch this video. But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie  geeky Internet culture. There were remixes. Someone made an old timey version. And then it went international. An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of. Because we don't just enjoy now  we participate. And who could have predicted any of this  Who could have predicted  Double Rainbow  or Rebecca Black or  Nyan Cat   What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it  In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute  only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have. When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City  I admit I wasn't very interested. but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. KA  By being totally surprising and humorous  Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times. And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively. And so it all brings us to one big question ... Ohhhh. KA  What does it mean  Tastemakers  creative participating communities  complete unexpectedness  these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity. I mean  as mentioned earlier  one of the biggest stars in the world right now  Justin Bieber  got his start on YouTube. No one has to green light your idea. And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture. And these are not characteristics of old media  and they're barely true of the media of today  but they will define the entertainment of the future. Thank you. The oceans cover some    percent of our planet. And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet Planet Ocean. And the oceans are hugely productive  as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis  the production of new life. In fact  the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe. In addition to that  it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth  and much of it we don't know about. But I'll tell you some of that today. That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean. That's about    percent of our global needs and     percent of some island nations. If you were to descend into the    percent of the biosphere that's livable  it would quickly become pitch black  interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms. And if you turn the lights on  you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by  because those are the denizens of the deep  the things that live in the deep ocean. And eventually  the deep sea floor would come into view. This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined. And yet  we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat  despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food  a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies. And so    years ago  an international program began called the Census of Marine Life  which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans. It involved    different projects around the world. As you can see  these are the footprints of the different projects. And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve. It all began when two scientists  Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel  met in Woods Hole  Massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute. And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it. Well  from that discussion grew this program that involved       scientists from more than    countries around the world who engaged in     ocean expeditions at a combined cost of     million dollars to study the distribution  diversity and abundance of life in the global ocean. And so what did we find  We found spectacular new species  the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked    from the shoreline to the abyss  form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between. And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life  but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step. They  in fact  are an endangered species themselves. There are actually four to five new species described everyday for the oceans. And as I say  it could be a much larger number. Now  I come from Newfoundland in Canada    It's an island off the east coast of that continent    where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters in human history. And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish. It's around     . Now  when I was a boy of about his age  I would go out fishing with my grandfather and we would catch fish about half that size. And I thought that was the norm  because I had never seen fish like this. If you were to go out there today     years after this fishery collapsed  if you could catch a fish  which would be a bit of a challenge  it would be half that size still. So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines. Our expectations of what the oceans can produce is something that we don't really appreciate because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes. Now most of us  and I would say me included  think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last    to  perhaps      years or so. The census actually tried to look back in time  using every source of information they could get their hands on. And so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships' logs to see what the oceans looked like. Because science data really goes back to  at best  World War II  for the most part. And so what they found  in fact  is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans. And so at that time  of course  there was no refrigeration. So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day. But the Romans developed salting. And with salting  it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances. And so began industrial fishing. And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have of what sort of loss we've had relative to pre human impacts on the ocean. They range from    to    percent for these major groups of organisms  as shown in the dark blue bars. Now for those species the we managed to leave alone  that we protect    for example  marine mammals in recent years and sea birds    there is some recovery. So it's not all hopeless. But for the most part  we've gone from salting to exhausting. Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one. It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida. And so this is a photograph from the     s. I want you to notice the scale on the slide  because when you see the same picture from the     s  we see the fish are much smaller and we're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish. By       the catch was actually laughable in terms of the size for a trophy fish. But this is no laughing matter. The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we're responsible for it. So what's left  Actually quite a lot. There's a lot of exciting things  and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them. And I want to start with a bit on technology  because  of course  this is a TED Conference and you want to hear something on technology. So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles. So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom. So a couple of years ago  I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict. But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet  a cup of tea in my hand  and I could tell the pilot   I want a sample right there.  And that's exactly what the pilot did for me. That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago. So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light. And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics  or sound waves. And the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water  unlike light. And so we can send out sound waves  they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back. And so in this example  a census scientist took out two ships. One would send out sound waves that would bounce back. They would be received by a second ship  and that would give us very precise estimates  in this case  of     billion herring in a period of about a minute. And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island. And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool  because knowing how many fish are there is really critical. We can also use satellite tags to track animals as they move through the oceans. And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe  such as this elephant seal  it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean. And so from that we can produce these tracks. For example  the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific. Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind  this slide is not very helpful  but stick with me nonetheless. For animals that don't surface  we have something called pop up tags  which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets. And then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and  again  relays that data back to shore. Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools. And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways  these hot spots in the ocean  that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation. Now one of the other things that you may think about is that  when you go to the supermarket and you buy things  they're scanned. And so there's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is. Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding. And what barcoding does is use a specific gene called CO  that's consistent within a species  but varies among species. And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify which species are which even if they look similar to each other  but may be biologically quite different. Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this is the story of two young women  high school students in New York City  who worked with the census. They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City and they barcoded it. Well what they found was mislabeled fish. So for example  they found something which was sold as tuna  which is very valuable  was in fact tilapia  which is a much less valuable fish. They also found an endangered species sold as a common one. So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with and also what we're eating. The Ocean Biogeographic Information System is the database for all the census data. It's open access  you can all go in and download data as you wish. And it contains all the data from the census plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute. And so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans. What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand. This is where our sampling effort has concentrated. Now what you can see is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic  in the North Sea in particular  and also the east coast of North America fairly well. That's the warm colors which show a well sampled region. The cold colors  the blue and the black  show areas where we have almost no data. So even after a    year census  there are large areas that still remain unexplored. Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas  working in the Gulf of Mexico who decided really as a labor of love to pull together all the knowledge they could about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico. And so they put this together  a list of all the species  where they're known to occur  and it really seemed like a very esoteric  scientific type of exercise. But then  of course  there was the Deep Horizon oil spill. So all of a sudden  this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover  how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi billion dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved. So what did we find  Well  I could stand here for hours  but  of course  I'm not allowed to do that. But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census. So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity  Where do we find the most species of ocean life  And what we find if we plot up the well known species is this sort of a distribution. And what we see is that for coastal tags  for those organisms that live near the shoreline  they're most diverse in the tropics. This is something we've actually known for a while  so it's not a real breakthrough. What is really exciting though is that the oceanic tags  or the ones that live far from the coast  are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes. This is the sort of data  again  that managers could use if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve. You can do this on a global scale  but you can also do it on a regional scale. And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable. Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see  that certainly wasn't always the case. For example  while it's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists  it did until a few years ago when South African fishermen requested an export permit and scientists realized that this was something new to science. Similarly this Golden V kelp collected in Alaska just below the low water mark is probably a new species. Even though it's three meters long  it actually  again  eluded science. Now this guy  this bigfin squid  is seven meters in length. But to be fair  it lives in the deep waters of the Mid Atlantic Ridge  so it was a lot harder to find. But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things. This particular shrimp  we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp  it's thought to have gone extinct    years ago    at least it was  until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia. And it shows that the ocean  because of its vastness  can hide secrets for a very long time. So  Steven Spielberg  eat your heart out. If we look at distributions  in fact distributions change dramatically. And so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater  which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from New Zealand all the way up to Alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles. We also talked about the White Shark Cafe. This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge. We don't know why they converge there  we simply don't know. That's a question for the future. One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive. Now this little critter  it's only about half a millimeter in size  not terribly charismatic. But it was only discovered in the early     s. But the really interesting thing about it is that  a few years ago  census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea. So now they know that  in fact  animals can live without oxygen  at least some of them  and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions. If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean  this is what you'd be left behind with  and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor. Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between. We found life in the extremes. And so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice based food web. And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island. And this particular species really captured the public's attention. We also found the deepest vents known yet          meters    the hottest vents at     degrees Celsius    vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic where none had been found before. So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable. Now in terms of the unknowns  there are many. And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you. First of all  we might ask  how many fishes in the sea  We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean other than marine mammals. And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we're likely to discover. And from that  we actually calculate that we know about        marine species and there are probably another       to       left to go. So we've done pretty well. We've got about    percent of the fish  maybe as much as    percent. But the fishes  as I say  are the best known. So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms. Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology. And what is does is predict how many more species there are on land and in the ocean. And what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean. That means    percent  even after the census  still remain to be discovered. And so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done. So we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns. Now this bacterium is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile. And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece. And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye. But you can imagine the biomass that represents. But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are. A single drop of seawater could contain     different types of microbes. And the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types. So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there  We actually don't know. The most exciting thing  I would say  about this census is the role of global science. And so as we see in this image of light during the night  there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less  but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean. The other point I'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected. Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries  they move where they will. And so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important. We've lost a lot of paradise. For example  these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea are now effectively gone. There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean  which collected more garbage than they did animals. And that's the deep sea  that's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on Earth. And there are a lot of other pressures. Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with  as well as ocean warming  and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs. On the scale of decades  in our lifetimes  we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs. And I could spend the rest of my time  which is getting very limited  going through this litany of concerns about the ocean  but I want to end on a more positive note. And so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left  because there is still spectacular beauty. And the oceans are so productive  there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans that we really need to  even from a selfish perspective  try to do better than we have in the past. So we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them. When we look at pictures like this  they take our breath away  in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide. Census scientists worked in the rain  they worked in the cold  they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery  the still vast unknown  the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life. So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile  whether you're a stockbroker in New York City or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh  the oceans matter. And as the oceans go so shall we. Thanks for listening. I'm going to speak about a tiny  little idea. And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute  I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time. And the first story is about Charles Darwin  one of my heroes. And he was here  as you well know  in '  . And you'd think he was chasing finches  but he wasn't. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them as very  common.  This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it until the '  s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story  we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places  so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is  we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say it is untouched. So what happens here  The second story  also to illustrate another concept  is called shifting waistline. Because I was there in '    studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn  and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn. And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees  as you can see  and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia about    centimeters  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana. When I went there    years later  the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed  but everything has changed. My third little story is that I was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in Southeast Asia. In the '  s    well  beginning in the '  s    Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already         fishers to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat  quite ugly  is called the Mutiara  . And I went sailing on it  and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught  we didn't have words for it. What we caught  I know now  is the bottom of the sea. And    percent of our catch were sponges  other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish  they are a little spot on the debris  the piles of debris  were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down. And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid. Within a year  you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed from  in this case  a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten  they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented. We transform the world  but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline to the new level  and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this  something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing  biodiversity  numbers of orca  the greenness of your country  the water supply. And over time it changes    it changes because people do things  or naturally. Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then  they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers. And that  to a large extent  is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were. Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies  they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations. Because  obviously  an animal that is very abundant  before it gets extinct  it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss. Over time  we concentrate on large animals  and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline. And the question is  why do people accept this  Well because they don't know that it was different. And in fact  lots of people  scientists  will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented. For example  the anecdote that some present  as Captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists  because it's not  scientific.  So you have a situation where people don't know the past  even though we live in literate societies  because they don't trust the sources of the past. And hence  the enormous role that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas  we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low. That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides  which enables them to reset their baseline. How about the people who can't do that because they have no access    the people in the Midwest for example  There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap  and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago        years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like  Avatar.  And if you think about  Avatar   if you think of why people were so touched by it    never mind the Pocahontas story    why so touched by the imagery  Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation  it's the only one I will provide  is for Cameron to do  Avatar II  underwater. Thank you very much. Let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week  four words that will come to define this century. Here they are  The Earth is full. It's full of us  it's full of our stuff  full of our waste  full of our demands. Yes  we are a brilliant and creative species  but we've created a little too much stuff    so much that our economy is now bigger than its host  our planet. This is not a philosophical statement  this is just science based in physics  chemistry and biology. There are many science based analyses of this  but they all draw the same conclusion    that we're living beyond our means. The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network  for example  calculate that we need about  .  Earths to sustain this economy. In other words  to keep operating at our current level  we need    percent more Earth than we've got. In financial terms  this would be like always spending    percent more than you earn  going further into debt every year. But of course  you can't borrow natural resources  so we're burning through our capital  or stealing from the future. So when I say full  I mean really full    well past any margin for error  well past any dispute about methodology. What this means is our economy is unsustainable. I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant or that it's bad for polar bears or forests  though it certainly is. What I'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable. In other words  thanks to those pesky laws of physics  when things aren't sustainable  they stop. But that's not possible  you might think. We can't stop economic growth. Because that's what will stop  economic growth. It will stop because of the end of trade resources. It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources  all the capacity  all the systems of the Earth  which is now having economic damage. When we think about economic growth stopping  we go   That's not possible   because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned. Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits  it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around. Even though it has delivered many benefits  it is based on a crazy idea    the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet. And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes. That the crazy idea is just that  it is crazy  and with the Earth full  it's game over. Come on  you're thinking. That's not possible. Technology is amazing. People are innovative. There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things. We can surely sort this out. That's all true. Well  it's mostly true. We are certainly amazing  and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity. So if our problem was to get the human economy down from     percent to     percent of the Earth's capacity  we could do that. The problem is we're just warming up this growth engine. We plan to take this highly stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big    not in some distant future  but in less than    years  in the life time of most of you. China plans to be there in just    years. The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible. In response  some people argue  but we need growth  we need it to solve poverty. We need it to develop technology. We need it to keep social stability. I find this argument fascinating  as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs. It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need. Mother nature doesn't negotiate  she just sets rules and describes consequences. And these are not esoteric limits. This is about food and water  soil and climate  the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives. So the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly efficient  solar powered  knowledge based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in      a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion. It's not that it's not possible to feed  clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives. It certainly is. But the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong  and it's dangerously wrong  because it means we're not getting ready for what's really going to happen. See what happens when you operate a system past its limits and then keep on going at an ever accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down. And that's what will happen to us. Many of you will be thinking  but surely we can still stop this. If it's that bad  we'll react. Let's just think through that idea. Now we've had    years of warnings. We've had science proving the urgency of change. We've had economic analysis pointing out that  not only can we afford it  it's cheaper to act early. And yet  the reality is we've done pretty much nothing to change course. We're not even slowing down. Last year on climate  for example  we had the highest global emissions ever. The story on food  on water  on soil  on climate is all much the same. I actually don't say this in despair. I've done my grieving about the loss. I accept where we are. It is sad  but it is what it is. But it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we're not acting  we're not close to acting and we're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy. And that's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for. So when does this transition begin  When does this breakdown begin  In my view  it is well underway. I know most people don't see it that way. We tend to look at the world  not as the integrated system that it is  but as a series of individual issues. We see the Occupy protests  we see spiraling debt crises  we see growing inequality  we see money's influence on politics  we see resource constraint  food and oil prices. But we see  mistakenly  each of these issues as individual problems to be solved. In fact  it's the system in the painful process of breaking down    our system  of debt fueled economic growth  of ineffective democracy  of overloading planet Earth  is eating itself alive. I could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this  but I won't because  if you want to see it  that evidence is all around you. I want to talk to you about fear. I want to do so because  in my view  the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question. The crisis is now inevitable. This issue is  how will we react  Of course  we can't know what will happen. The future is inherently uncertain. But let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen. Imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts  when the financial markets recognize that  to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control  the oil and coal industries are finished. Imagine China  India and Pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water. Imagine the Middle East without oil income  but with collapsing governments. Imagine our highly tuned  just in time food industry and our highly stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying. Imagine    percent unemployment in America as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty. Now imagine what that means for you  your family  your friends  your personal financial security. Imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen. Imagine what you'll tell your children when they ask you   So  in       Mom and Dad  what was it like when you'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row  when every scientific body in the world was saying you've got a major problem  when the oceans were acidifying  when oil and food prices were spiking  when they were rioting in the streets of London and occupying Wall Street  When the system was so clearly breaking down  Mom and Dad  what did you do  what were you thinking   So how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your mind  when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges  Just take a moment and take a breath and think  what do you feel at this point  Perhaps denial. Perhaps anger. Maybe fear. Of course  we can't know what's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty. But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint  we should feel a bit of fear. We are in danger  all of us  and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response  to help us bravely face a threat. But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth. You can't see the danger at your door. But if you look  you can see it at the door of your civilization. That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on  because if we wait until the crisis takes hold  we may panic and hide. If we feel it now and think it through  we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself. Yes  things will get ugly  and it will happen soon    certainly in our lifetime    but we are more than capable of getting through everything that's coming. You see  those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem  that technology is limitless  that markets can be a force for good  are in fact right. The only thing they're missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going. When we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things. Think about war. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor  it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry  and from there to rationing of food and energy. Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done. Think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy. We are smart  in fact  we really are quite amazing  but we do love a good crisis. And the good news  this one's a monster. Sure  if we get it wrong  we could face the end of this civilization  but if we get it right  it could be the beginning of civilization instead. And how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that  There's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way. Scientists like James Hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net CO  emissions from the economy in just a few decades. I wanted to know what that would take  so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway to find the answer. We developed a plan called  The One Degree War Plan     so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required. To my surprise  eliminating net CO  emissions from the economy in just    years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap  not very cheap  but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization. We didn't calculate that precisely  but we understand that's very expensive. You can read the details  but in summary  we can transform our economy. We can do it with proven technology. We can do it at an affordable cost. We can do it with existing political structures. The only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel. And this is where you come in. When we think about the future I paint  of course we should feel a bit of fear. But fear can be paralyzing or motivating. We need to accept the fear and then we need to act. We need to act like the future depends on it. We need to act like we only have one planet. We can do this. I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth  more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do. They're wrong. We can be more  we can be much more. We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some        years ago. We've built a powerful foundation of science  knowledge and technology    more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent  meaningful and satisfying lives. The Earth can support that if we choose the right path. We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution    like  what do we want to be when we grow up  when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality  Well it's time to grow up  to be wiser  to be calmer  to be more considered. Like generations before us  we'll be growing up in war    not a war between civilizations  but a war for civilization  for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age. We can choose life over fear. We can do what we need to do  but it will take every entrepreneur  every artist  every scientist  every communicator  every mother  every father  every child  every one of us.

Peter Diamandis  So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months    could have easily been the last six days or the last six years. The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to. And there's a very good reason for that. Every second of every day  our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains. And because nothing is more important to us than survival  the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala. Now the amygdala is our early warning detector  our danger detector. It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. So given a dozen news stories  we will preferentially look at the negative news. And that old newspaper saying   If it bleeds it leads   is very true. So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week     hours a day  it's no wonder that we're pessimistic. It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse. But perhaps that's not the case. Perhaps instead  it's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on. Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are  in fact  accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance. Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems    climate crisis  species extinction  water and energy shortage    we surely do. And as humans  we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance  but ultimately we knock them down. So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going. Over the last hundred years  the average human lifespan has more than doubled  average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled. Childhood mortality has come down a factor of   . Add to that the cost of food  electricity  transportation  communication have dropped    to       fold. Steve Pinker has showed us that  in fact  we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history. And Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from    percent to over    percent in the last     years. We truly are living in an extraordinary time. And many people forget this. And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. In fact  we redefine what poverty means. Think of this  in America today  the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity  water  toilets  refrigerators  television  mobile phones  air conditioning and cars. The wealthiest robber barons of the last century  the emperors on this planet  could have never dreamed of such luxuries. Underpinning much of this is technology  and of late  exponentially growing technologies. My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve  on Moore's Law  and experiences price performance doubling every    to    months. That's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '  s. Now look at this curve. This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. I want you to notice two things from this curve. Number one  how smooth it is    through good time and bad time  war time and peace time  recession  depression and boom time. This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers. It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. And also  even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left  it's curving upwards. The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster. And on this curve  riding on Moore's Law  are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us. Cloud computing  what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing  sensors and networks  robotics   D printing  which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet  synthetic biology  fuels  vaccines and foods  digital medicine  nanomaterials  and A.I. I mean  how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson  I mean  that was epic. In fact  I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. And I love this   Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents.  Jeopardy's not an easy game. It's about the nuance of human language. And imagine if you would A.I.'s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone. Four years ago here at TED  Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University. And we teach our students all of these technologies  and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges. And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade. Think about that  the fact that  literally  a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.    years ago that would have sounded ludicrous. Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that. When I think about creating abundance  it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet  it's about creating a life of possibility. It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant. You see  scarcity is contextual  and technology is a resource liberating force. Let me give you an example. So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid     s. He's the dude on the left. He invited over to dinner the king of Siam. All of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils  Napoleon himself with gold utensils. But the King of Siam  he was fed with aluminum utensils. You see  aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet  worth more than gold and platinum. It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. You see  even though aluminum is  .  percent of the Earth by mass  it doesn't come as a pure metal. It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw away mentality. So let's project this analogy going forward. We think about energy scarcity. Ladies and gentlemen  we are on a planet that is bathed with       times more energy than we use in a year.    terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface every    minutes. It's not about being scarce  it's about accessibility. And there's good news here. For the first time  this year the cost of solar generated electricity is    percent that of diesel generated electricity in India     .  rupees versus    rupees. The cost of solar dropped    percent last year. Last month  MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade  in the sunny parts of the United States  solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to    cents as a national average. And if we have abundant energy  we also have abundant water. Now we talk about water wars. Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth  in      after it just passed Saturn  He took a famous photo. What was it called   A Pale Blue Dot.  Because we live on a water planet. We live on a planet    percent covered by water. Yes    .  percent is saltwater  two percent is ice  and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet  but here too there is hope. And there is technology coming online  not        years from now  right now. There's nanotechnology coming on  nanomaterials. And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning  one of the great DIY innovators  I'd like to share with you    he gave me permission to do so    his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of  it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source    saltwater  polluted water  latrine    at less than two cents a liter. The chairman of Coca Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world. And if that pans out  which I have every confidence it will  Coca Cola will deploy this globally to     countries around the planet. This is the kind of innovation  empowered by this technology  that exists today. And we've seen this in cellphones. My goodness  we're going to hit    percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of     . Think about it  that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did    years ago. And if they're on a smartphone on Google  they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did    years ago. They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted. Better than that  the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for    GPS  HD video and still images  libraries of books and music  medical diagnostic technology    are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone. Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health. Last month  I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the     million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to  because it's got A.I.  you can cough on it  you can do a finger blood prick. And to win  it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors. So literally  imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors     percent of the disease burden and  .  percent of the health care workers. When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize  it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place. But here  here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance. I call it the rising billion. So the white lines here are population. We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth. And by the way  the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy. In       we had just short of two billion people online  connected. By       that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users. Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation. What will these people want  What will they consume  What will they desire  And rather than having economic shutdown  we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever. These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy. And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder  and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy  and by literally being able to use  D printing and infinite computing  become  more productive than ever before. So what could three billion rising  healthy  educated  productive members of humanity bring to us  How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. What about giving the oppressed  wherever they might be  the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever  What will these three billion people bring  What about contributions we can't even predict  The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things  things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past. Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited. There is a program that some of you might have heard of. It's a game called Foldit. It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle. And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold. And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. And it's very important for research in medicine. And up until now  it's been a supercomputer problem. And this game has been played by university professors and so forth. And it's literally  hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it. And it showed that  in fact  today  the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers. And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world  it wasn't an MIT professor  it wasn't a CalTech student  it was a person from England  from Manchester  a woman who  during the day  was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and  at night  was the world's best protein folder. Ladies and gentlemen  what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet. We have the tools with this exponential technology. We have the passion of the DIY innovator. We have the capital of the techno philanthropist. And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges  to do that which we must do. We are living into extraordinary decades ahead. Thank you. Good morning. I'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls. No  agile aerial robots like this one. I'd like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these  and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology. So these robots are related to unmanned aerial vehicles. However  the vehicles you see here are big. They weigh thousands of pounds  are not by any means agile. They're not even autonomous. In fact  many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews that can include multiple pilots  operators of sensors  and mission coordinators. What we're interested in is developing robots like this    and here are two other pictures    of robots that you can buy off the shelf. So these are helicopters with four rotors  and they're roughly a meter or so in scale  and weigh several pounds. And so we retrofit these with sensors and processors  and these robots can fly indoors. Without GPS. The robot I'm holding in my hand is this one  and it's been created by two students  Alex and Daniel. So this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound. It consumes about    watts of power. And as you can see  it's about eight inches in diameter. So let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work. So it has four rotors. If you spin these rotors at the same speed  the robot hovers. If you increase the speed of each of these rotors  then the robot flies up  it accelerates up. Of course  if the robot were tilted  inclined to the horizontal  then it would accelerate in this direction. So to get it to tilt  there's one of two ways of doing it. So in this picture  you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower. And when that happens  there's a moment that causes this robot to roll. And the other way around  if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one  then the robot pitches forward. And then finally  if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair  then the robot yaws about the vertical axis. So an on board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions  and figures out what commands to send to the motors        times a second. That's basically how this thing operates. So one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down  the robot naturally becomes agile. So here  R is the characteristic length of the robot. It's actually half the diameter. And there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce R. The one that's most important is the inertia  or the resistance to motion. So it turns out the inertia  which governs angular motion  scales as a fifth power of R. So the smaller you make R  the more dramatically the inertia reduces. So as a result  the angular acceleration  denoted by the Greek letter alpha here  goes as   over R. It's inversely proportional to R. The smaller you make it  the more quickly you can turn. So this should be clear in these videos. On the bottom right  you see a robot performing a     degree flip in less than half a second. Multiple flips  a little more time. So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board  and calculating  like I said before  commands at     times a second  to stabilize this robot. So on the left  you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air  and it shows you how robust the control is. No matter how you throw it  the robot recovers and comes back to him. So why build robots like this  Well  robots like this have many applications. You can send them inside buildings like this  as first responders to look for intruders  maybe look for biochemical leaks  gaseous leaks. You can also use them for applications like construction. So here are robots carrying beams  columns and assembling cube like structures. I'll tell you a little bit more about this. The robots can be used for transporting cargo. So one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity. So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads. This is a picture of a recent experiment we did    actually not so recent anymore    in Sendai  shortly after the earthquake. So robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings  to assess the damage after natural disasters  or sent into reactor buildings  to map radiation levels. So one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous  is essentially figuring out how to get from point A to point B. So this gets a little challenging  because the dynamics of this robot are quite complicated. In fact  they live in a    dimensional space. So we use a little trick. We take this curved    dimensional space  and transform it into a flat  four dimensional space. And that four dimensional space consists of X  Y  Z  and then the yaw angle. And so what the robot does  is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory. So to remind you of physics  You have position  derivative  velocity  then acceleration  and then comes jerk  and then comes snap. So this robot minimizes snap. So what that effectively does  is produce a smooth and graceful motion. And it does that avoiding obstacles. So these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated    dimensional space  which the robot must do for control and then execution. So let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like. And in the first video  you'll see the robot going from point A to point B  through an intermediate point. So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory. So these are circular trajectories  where the robot pulls about two G's. Here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is     times a second. It also tells the robot where these obstacles are. And the obstacles can be moving. And here  you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air  while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop  and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop. So as an academic  we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs  and we get our robots to do that. So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre programmed. So here  you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum  and then changes its orientation and then recovers. So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot. So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum  and then does this pirouette  this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers  this robot is basically doing that. So it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks. So I want change gears. So one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size. And I told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size. So one difficulty is  How do you coordinate lots of these robots  And so here  we looked to nature. So I want to show you a clip of Aphaenogaster desert ants  in Professor Stephen Pratt's lab  carrying an object. So this is actually a piece of fig. Actually you take any object coated with fig juice  and the ants will carry it back to the nest. So these ants don't have any central coordinator. They sense their neighbors. There's no explicit communication. But because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object  they have implicit coordination across the group. So this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have. So when we have a robot which is surrounded by neighbors    and let's look at robot I and robot J    what we want the robots to do  is to monitor the separation between them  as they fly in formation. And then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels. So again  the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands     times a second  which then translates into motor commands      times a second. So this also has to be done in a decentralized way. Again  if you have lots and lots of robots  it's impossible to coordinate all this information centrally fast enough in order for the robots to accomplish the task. Plus  the robots have to base their actions only on local information    what they sense from their neighbors. And then finally  we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are. So this is what we call anonymity. So what I want to show you next is a video of    of these little robots  flying in formation. They're monitoring their neighbors' positions. They're maintaining formation. The formations can change. They can be planar formations  they can be three dimensional formations. As you can see here  they collapse from a three dimensional formation into planar formation. And to fly through obstacles  they can adapt the formations on the fly. So again  these robots come really close together. As you can see in this figure eight flight  they come within inches of each other. And despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades  they're able to maintain stable flight. So once you know how to fly in formation  you can actually pick up objects cooperatively. So this just shows that we can double  triple  quadruple the robots' strength  by just getting them to team with neighbors  as you can see here. One of the disadvantages of doing that is  as you scale things up    so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing  you're essentially increasing the inertia  and therefore you pay a price  they're not as agile. But you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity. Another application I want to show you    again  this is in our lab. This is work done by Quentin Lindsey  who's a graduate student. So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss like elements. So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up  when  and where to place it. So in this video you see    and it's sped up        times    you see three different structures being built by these robots. And again  everything is autonomous  and all Quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build. So all these experiments you've seen thus far  all these demonstrations  have been done with the help of motion capture systems. So what happens when you leave your lab  and you go outside into the real world  And what if there's no GPS  So this robot is actually equipped with a camera  and a laser rangefinder  laser scanner. And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment. What that map consists of are features    like doorways  windows  people  furniture    and it then figures out where its position is  with respect to the features. So there is no global coordinate system. The coordinate system is defined based on the robot  where it is and what it's looking at. And it navigates with respect to those features. So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael  that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time  and creating this map on the fly. So the robot then figures out what the features are  it builds the map  it figures out where it is with respect to the features  and then estimates its position     times a second  allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier. So this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank  but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own. So suppose I were to send this into a building  and I had no idea what this building looked like. I can ask this robot to go in  create a map  and then come back and tell me what the building looks like. So here  the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map  but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time. So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information  and that's how it populates this map. So I want to leave you with one last application. And there are many applications of this technology. I'm a professor  and we're passionate about education. Robots like this can really change the way we do K    education. But we're in Southern California  close to Los Angeles  so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment. I want to conclude with a music video. I want to introduce the creators  Alex and Daniel  who created this video. So before I play this video  I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days  after getting a call from Chris. And the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous. You will see nine robots play six different instruments. And of course  it's made exclusively for TED     . Let's watch. When I was nine years old  I went off to summer camp for the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books  which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do. Because in my family  reading was the primary group activity. And this might sound antisocial to you  but for us it was really just a different way of being social. You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you  but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind. And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this  but better. I had a vision of    girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns. Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol. And on the very first day  our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit. And it went like this   R O W D I E  that's the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie  rowdie  let's get rowdie.  Yeah. So I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy  or why we had to spell this word incorrectly. But I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else. I did my best. And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books. But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase  the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me   Why are you being so mellow      mellow  of course  being the exact opposite of R O W D I E. And then the second time I tried it  the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing. And so I put my books away  back in their suitcase  and I put them under my bed  and there they stayed for the rest of the summer. And I felt kind of guilty about this. I felt as if the books needed me somehow  and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them. But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer. Now  I tell you this story about summer camp. I could have told you    others just like it    all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go  that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert. And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were. But for years I denied this intuition  and so I became a Wall Street lawyer  of all things  instead of the writer that I had always longed to be    partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too. And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends. And I made these self negating choices so reflexively  that I wasn't even aware that I was making them. Now this is what many introverts do  and it's our loss for sure  but it is also our colleagues' loss and our communities' loss. And at the risk of sounding grandiose  it is the world's loss. Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership  we need introverts doing what they do best. A third to a half of the population are introverts    a third to a half. So that's one out of every two or three people you know. So even if you're an extrovert yourself  I'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now    all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society. We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing. Now  to see the bias clearly  you need to understand what introversion is. It's different from being shy. Shyness is about fear of social judgment. Introversion is more about  how do you respond to stimulation  including social stimulation. So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation  whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and their most capable when they're in quieter  more low key environments. Not all the time    these things aren't absolute    but a lot of the time. So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us. But now here's where the bias comes in. Our most important institutions  our schools and our workplaces  they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation. And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink  which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place. So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays  When I was going to school  we sat in rows. We sat in rows of desks like this  and we did most of our work pretty autonomously. But nowadays  your typical classroom has pods of desks    four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other. And kids are working in countless group assignments. Even in subjects like math and creative writing  which you think would depend on solo flights of thought  kids are now expected to act as committee members. And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone  those kids are seen as outliers often or  worse  as problem cases. And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert  even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable  according to research. Okay  same thing is true in our workplaces. Now  most of us work in open plan offices  without walls  where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership  introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions  even though introverts tend to be very careful  much less likely to take outsize risks    which is something we might all favor nowadays. And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do  because when they are managing proactive employees  they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas  whereas an extrovert can  quite unwittingly  get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things  and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface. Now in fact  some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts. I'll give you some examples. Eleanor Roosevelt  Rosa Parks  Gandhi    all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft spoken and even shy. And they all took the spotlight  even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to. And this turns out to have a special power all its own  because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at  they were there because they had no choice  because they were driven to do what they thought was right. Now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts. I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts  including my beloved husband. And we all fall at different points  of course  along the introvert extrovert spectrum. Even Carl Jung  the psychologist who first popularized these terms  said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert. He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum  if he existed at all. And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum  and we call these people ambiverts. And I often think that they have the best of all worlds. But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other. And what I'm saying is that culturally  we need a much better balance. We need more of a yin and yang between these two types. This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity  because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people  what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas  but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them. And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity. So Darwin  he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations. Theodor Geisel  better known as Dr. Seuss  he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla  California. And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona. Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett Packard where he was working at the time. And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up. Now  of course  this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating    and case in point  is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer    but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe. And in fact  we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude. It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it. If you look at most of the world's major religions  you will find seekers    Moses  Jesus  Buddha  Muhammad    seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness  where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community. So  no wilderness  no revelations. This is no surprise  though  if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology. It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring  mimicking their opinions. Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to  you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that's what you're doing. And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room  even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas    I mean zero. So    You might be following the person with the best ideas  but you might not. And do you really want to leave it up to chance  Much better for everybody to go off by themselves  generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics  and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well managed environment and take it from there. Now if all this is true  then why are we getting it so wrong  Why are we setting up our schools this way  and our workplaces  And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time  One answer lies deep in our cultural history. Western societies  and in particular the U.S.  have always favored the man of action over the  man  of contemplation. But in America's early days  we lived in what historians call a culture of character  where we still  at that point  valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude. And if you look at the self help books from this era  they all had titles with things like  Character  the Grandest Thing in the World.  And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln  who was praised for being modest and unassuming. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him  A man who does not offend by superiority.  But then we hit the   th century  and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality. What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business. And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities. And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives  now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers. So  quite understandably  qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough  the self help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like  How to Win Friends and Influence People.  And they feature as their role models really great salesmen. So that's the world we're living in today. That's our cultural inheritance. Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant  and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all. The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust. And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together. But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves  the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems. So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today. Guess what  Books. I have a suitcase full of books. Here's Margaret Atwood   Cat's Eye.  Here's a novel by Milan Kundera. And here's  The Guide for the Perplexed  by Maimonides. But these are not exactly my books. I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors. My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up  partly because it was filled with his very gentle  very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books. I mean literally every table  every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books. Just like the rest of my family  my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read. But he also loved his congregation  and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the    years that he was a rabbi. He would takes the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought. And people would come from all over to hear him speak. But here's the thing about my grandfather. Underneath this ceremonial role  he was really modest and really introverted    so much so that when he delivered these sermons  he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for    years. And even away from the podium  when you called him to say hello  he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time. But when he died at the age of     the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him. And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way. So I just published a book about introversion  and it took me about seven years to write. And for me  that seven years was like total bliss  because I was reading  I was writing  I was thinking  I was researching. It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library. But now all of a sudden my job is very different  and my job is to be out here talking about it  talking about introversion. And that's a lot harder for me  because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now  this is not my natural milieu. So I prepared for moments like these as best I could. I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get. And I call this my  year of speaking dangerously.  And that actually helped a lot. But I'll tell you  what helps even more is my sense  my belief  my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude  we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change. I mean  we are. And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision. Number one  Stop the madness for constant group work. Just stop it. Thank you. And I want to be clear about what I'm saying  because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual  chatty cafe style types of interactions    you know  the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas. That is great. It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts. But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work. School  same thing. We need to be teaching kids to work together  for sure  but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own. This is especially important for extroverted children too. They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part. Okay  number two  Go to the wilderness. Be like Buddha  have your own revelations. I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again  but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often. Number three  Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there. So extroverts  maybe your suitcases are also full of books. Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment. Whatever it is  I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy. But introverts  you being you  you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase. And that's okay. But occasionally  just occasionally  I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see  because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry. So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me. I spend most of my time in jails  in prisons  on death row. I spend most of my time in very low income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness. And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation  hearing it  has been very  very energizing to me. And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity. And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world. And sometimes when it comes through TED  it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't. And I mention that because I think identity is really important. And we've had some fantastic presentations. And I think what we've learned is that  if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful  but if you're a compassionate teacher  they can be especially meaningful. If you're a doctor you can do some good things  but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things. And so I want to talk about the power of identity. And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do. I actually learned about this from my grandmother. I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch  and that matriarch was my grandmother. She was tough  she was strong  she was powerful. She was the end of every argument in our family. She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family. She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved. Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the     's. She was born in the     's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world. And my grandmother was tough  but she was also loving. When I would see her as a little boy  she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs. And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go. And an hour or two later  if I saw her  she'd come over to me and she'd say   Bryan  do you still feel me hugging you   And if I said   No   she'd assault me again  and if I said   Yes   she'd leave me alone. And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her. And the only challenge was that she had    children. My mom was the youngest of her    kids. And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her  it would be difficult to get her time and attention. My cousins would be running around everywhere. And I remember  when I was about eight or nine years old  waking up one morning  going into the living room  and all of my cousins were running around. And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me. And at first I thought we were playing a game. And I would look at her and I'd smile  but she was very serious. And after about    or    minutes of this  she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said   Come on  Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk.  And I remember this just like it happened yesterday. I never will forget it. She took me out back and she said   Bryan  I'm going to tell you something  but you don't tell anybody what I tell you.  I said   Okay  Mama.  She said   Now you make sure you don't do that.  I said   Sure.  Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said   I want you to know I've been watching you.  And she said   I think you're special.  She said   I think you can do anything you want to do.  I will never forget it. And then she said   I just need you to promise me three things  Bryan.  I said   Okay  Mama.  She said   The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom.  She said   That's my baby girl  and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her.  Well I adored my mom  so I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  Then she said   The second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing.  And I thought about it and I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  Then finally she said   The third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol.  Well I was nine years old  so I said   Yes  Mama. I'll do that.  I grew up in the country in the rural South  and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger. When I was about    or     one day my brother came home and he had this six pack of beer    I don't know where he got it    and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods. And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did. And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some  and they offered it to me. I said   No  no  no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer.  My brother said   Come on. We're doing this today  you always do what we do. I had some  your sister had some. Have some beer.  I said   No  I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead.  And then my brother started staring at me. He said   What's wrong with you  Have some beer.  Then he looked at me real hard and he said   Oh  I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you.  I said   Well  what are you talking about   He said   Oh  Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special.  I was devastated. And I'm going to admit something to you. I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't. I know this might be broadcast broadly. But I'm    years old  and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol. I don't say that because I think that's virtuous  I say that because there is power in identity. When we create the right kind of identity  we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense. We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do. When I thought about my grandmother  of course she would think all her grandkids were special. My grandfather was in prison during prohibition. My male uncles died of alcohol related diseases. And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to. Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system. This country is very different today than it was    years ago. In       there were         people in jails and prisons. Today  there are  .  million. The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. We have seven million people on probation and parole. And mass incarceration  in my judgment  has fundamentally changed our world. In poor communities  in communities of color there is this despair  there is this hopelessness  that is being shaped by these outcomes. One out of three black men between the ages of    and    is in jail  in prison  on probation or parole. In urban communities across this country    Los Angeles  Philadelphia  Baltimore  Washington       to    percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole. Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race  they're also distorted by poverty. We have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. Wealth  not culpability  shapes outcomes. And yet  we seem to be very comfortable. The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems. We've been disconnected. It's interesting to me. We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work. My state of Alabama  like a number of states  actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction. Right now in Alabama    percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote. We're actually projecting in another    years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. And there is this stunning silence. I represent children. A lot of my clients are very young. The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence    year old children to die in prison. We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country. And we're actually doing some litigation. The only country in the world. I represent people on death row. It's interesting  this question of the death penalty. In many ways  we've been taught to think that the real question is  do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed  And that's a very sensible question. But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity. The other way of thinking about it is not  do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit  but do we deserve to kill  I mean  it's fascinating. Death penalty in America is defined by error. For every nine people who have been executed  we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row. A kind of astonishing error rate    one out of nine people innocent. I mean  it's fascinating. In aviation  we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash. But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem. It's not our problem. It's not our burden. It's not our struggle. I talk a lot about these issues. I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill. And it's interesting  when I teach my students about African American history  I tell them about slavery. I tell them about terrorism  the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II. We don't really know very much about it. But for African Americans in this country  that was an era defined by terror. In many communities  people had to worry about being lynched. They had to worry about being bombed. It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives. And these older people come up to me now and they say   Mr. Stevenson  you give talks  you make speeches  you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after     .  They tell me to say   No  tell them that we grew up with that.  And that era of terrorism  of course  was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid. And yet  we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems. We don't like to talk about our history. And because of that  we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically. We're constantly running into each other. We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts. We have a hard time talking about race  and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation. In South Africa  people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation. In Rwanda  even after the genocide  there was this commitment  but in this country we haven't done that. I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty. It was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said   Well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about.  He said   We don't have the death penalty in Germany. And of course  we can never have the death penalty in Germany.  And the room got very quiet  and this woman said   There's no way  with our history  we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings. It would be unconscionable for us to  in an intentional and deliberate way  set about executing people.  And I thought about that. What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people  especially if they were disproportionately Jewish  I couldn't bear it. It would be unconscionable. And yet  in this country  in the states of the Old South  we execute people    where you're    times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black     times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white    in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched. And yet  there is this disconnect. Well I believe that our identity is at risk. That when we actually don't care about these difficult things  the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated. We love innovation. We love technology. We love creativity. We love entertainment. But ultimately  those realities are shadowed by suffering  abuse  degradation  marginalization. And for me  it becomes necessary to integrate the two. Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful  more committed  more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world. And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor  the disadvantaged  those who will never get to TED. But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives. You know ultimately  we all have to believe things we haven't seen. We do. As rational as we are  as committed to intellect as we are. Innovation  creativity  development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone. They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart. And it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things  but also the dark and difficult things. Vaclav Havel  the great Czech leader  talked about this. He said   When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression  we wanted all kinds of things  but mostly what we needed was hope  an orientation of the spirit  a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness.  Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in. There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering  to poverty  to exclusion  to unfairness  to injustice. Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this. It will get to you. I had the great privilege  when I was a young lawyer  of meeting Rosa Parks. And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then  and she would get together with two of her dearest friends  these older women  Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott    amazing African American woman    and Virginia Durr  a white woman  whose husband  Clifford Durr  represented Dr. King. And these women would get together and just talk. And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me  and she'd say   Bryan  Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk. Do you want to come over and listen   And I'd say   Yes  Ma'am  I do.  And she'd say   Well what are you going to do when you get here   I said   I'm going to listen.  And I'd go over there and I would  I would just listen. It would be so energizing and so empowering. And one time I was over there listening to these women talk  and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said   Now Bryan  tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is. Tell me what you're trying to do.  And I began giving her my rap. I said   Well we're trying to challenge injustice. We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted. We're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice. We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children. We're trying to do something about the death penalty. We're trying to reduce the prison population. We're trying to end mass incarceration.  I gave her my whole rap  and when I finished she looked at me and she said   Mmm mmm mmm.  She said   That's going to make you tired  tired  tired.  And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward  she put her finger in my face  she said   That's why you've got to be brave  brave  brave.  And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous. We need to find ways to embrace these challenges  these problems  the suffering. Because ultimately  our humanity depends on everyone's humanity. I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do. It's just taught me very simple things. I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. I believe that for every person on the planet. I think if somebody tells a lie  they're not just a liar. I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them  they're not just a thief. I think even if you kill someone  you're not just a killer. And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law. I also believe that in many parts of this country  and certainly in many parts of this globe  that the opposite of poverty is not wealth. I don't believe that. I actually think  in too many places  the opposite of poverty is justice. And finally  I believe that  despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating  we will ultimately not be judged by our technology  we won't be judged by our design  we won't be judged by our intellect and reason. Ultimately  you judge the character of a society  not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged  but by how they treat the poor  the condemned  the incarcerated. Because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are. I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story. I sometimes push too hard. I do get tired  as we all do. Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important. And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences. And I go to the jail and I see my client who's    and     and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult. I start thinking  well  how did that happen  How can a judge turn you into something that you're not  And the judge has certified him as an adult  but I see this kid. And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking  well gosh  if the judge can turn you into something that you're not  the judge must have magic power. Yeah  Bryan  the judge has some magic power. You should ask for some of that. And because I was up too late  wasn't thinking real straight  I started working on a motion. And I had a client who was    years old  a young  poor black kid. And I started working on this motion  and the head of the motion was   Motion to try my poor     year old black male client like a privileged  white    year old corporate executive.  And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct. There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county  it's all misconduct. And the next morning  I woke up and I thought  now did I dream that crazy motion  or did I actually write it  And to my horror  not only had I written it  but I had sent it to court. A couple months went by  and I had just forgotten all about it. And I finally decided  oh gosh  I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case. And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed    overwhelmed. And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse. And I was thinking  this is going to be so difficult  so painful. And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse. And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse  there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse. When this man saw me  he came over to me and he said   Who are you   I said   I'm a lawyer.  He said   You're a lawyer   I said   Yes  sir.  And this man came over to me and he hugged me. And he whispered in my ear. He said   I'm so proud of you.  And I have to tell you  it was energizing. It connected deeply with something in me about identity  about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community  to a perspective that is hopeful. Well I went into the courtroom. And as soon as I walked inside  the judge saw me coming in. He said   Mr. Stevenson  did you write this crazy motion   I said   Yes  sir. I did.  And we started arguing. And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things. And police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers. And before I knew it  the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race  that we were talking about poverty  that we were talking about inequality. And out of the corner of my eye  I could see this janitor pacing back and forth. And he kept looking through the window  and he could hear all of this holler. He kept pacing back and forth. And finally  this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me  almost at counsel table. About    minutes later the judge said we would take a break. And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court. And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man. He said   Jimmy  what are you doing in this courtroom   And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said   I came into this courtroom to tell this young man  keep your eyes on the prize  hold on.  I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long  but it bends toward justice. That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity. That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone. That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity  compassion and justice. And more than anything  for those of you who share that  I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize  hold on. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience  this community  to help you on your way and to do something on this issue. Other than writing a check  what could we do  BS  Well there are opportunities all around us. If you live in the state of California  for example  there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment. For example  here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years    one billion dollars. And yet     percent of all homicide cases don't result in arrest.    percent of all rape cases don't result. So there's an opportunity to change that. And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety. And I think that opportunity exists all around us. CA  There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades. And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates. What would you say to someone who believed that  BS  Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable. The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories. It was this misguided war on drugs. That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population. And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment. And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle  for low level property crimes  rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized. I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime  not do less. And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one. And I think that's the orientation that we have to change. CA  Bryan  you've struck a massive chord here. You're an inspiring person. Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you. A tourist is backpacking through the highlands of Scotland  and he stops at a pub to get a drink. And the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer. And he orders a pint  and they sit in silence for a while. And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes   You see this bar  I built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county. Gave it more love and care than my own child. But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder  No.  Points out the window.  You see that stone wall out there  I built that stone wall with my bare hands. Found every stone  placed them just so through the rain and the cold. But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder  No.  Points out the window.  You see that pier on the lake out there  I built that pier with my bare hands. Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand  plank by plank. But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder  No. But you fuck one goat ...   Storytelling    is joke telling. It's knowing your punchline  your ending  knowing that everything you're saying  from the first sentence to the last  is leading to a singular goal  and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings. We all love stories. We're born for them. Stories affirm who we are. We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning. And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories. It can cross the barriers of time  past  present and future  and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others  real and imagined. The children's television host Mr. Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said   Frankly  there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story.  And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment  which is  Make me care     please  emotionally  intellectually  aesthetically  just make me care. We all know what it's like to not care. You've gone through hundreds of TV channels  just switching channel after channel  and then suddenly you actually stop on one. It's already halfway over  but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care. That's not by chance  that's by design. So it got me thinking  what if I told you my history was story  how I was born for it  how I learned along the way this subject matter  And to make it more interesting  we'll start from the ending and we'll go to the beginning. And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story  it would go something like this  And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story. And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in     . The film is  John Carter.  It's based on a book called  The Princess of Mars   which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie  and as the narrator. And he's summoned by his rich uncle  John Carter  to his mansion with a telegram saying   See me at once.  But once he gets there  he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property. Thing only opens from the inside. He insisted  no embalming  no open coffin  no funeral. You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us  huh  Come  let's go inside. AS  What this scene is doing  and it did in the book  is it's fundamentally making a promise. It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time. And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning  is they should give you a promise. You could do it an infinite amount of ways. Sometimes it's as simple as  Once upon a time ...   These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it. And I always thought it was such a fantastic device. It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire  or somebody in a bar saying   Here  let me tell you a story. It didn't happen to me  it happened to somebody else  but it's going to be worth your time.  A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end. In       I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project.   And that is all     that love's about     And we'll recall     when time runs out     That it only   AS  Storytelling without dialogue. It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling. It's the most inclusive approach you can take. It confirmed something I really had a hunch on  is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal. They just don't want to know that they're doing that. That's your job as a storyteller  is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal. We're born problem solvers. We're compelled to deduce and to deduct  because that's what we do in real life. It's this well organized absence of information that draws us in. There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy. It's not just that they're damn cute  it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are. And it's like a magnet. We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in. I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on  Finding Nemo.  And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two. Make the audience put things together. Don't give them four  give them two plus two. The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience. Editors and screenwriters have known this all along. It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story. I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science  it's not. That's what's so special about stories  they're not a widget  they aren't exact. Stories are inevitable  if they're good  but they're not predictable. I took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named Judith Weston. And I learned a key insight to character. She believed that all well drawn characters have a spine. And the idea is that the character has an inner motor  a dominant  unconscious goal that they're striving for  an itch that they can't scratch. She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone  Al Pacino's character in  The Godfather   and that probably his spine was to please his father. And it's something that always drove all his choices. Even after his father died  he was still trying to scratch that itch. I took to this like a duck to water. Wall E's was to find the beauty. Marlin's  the father in  Finding Nemo   was to prevent harm. And Woody's was to do what was best for his child. And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices. Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them. I'm really blessed to be a parent  and watching my children grow  I really firmly believe that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way  and you don't have any say about it  and there's no changing it. All you can do is learn to recognize it and own it. And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive  some are negative. But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it. As parents  you're always learning who your children are. They're learning who they are. And you're still learning who you are. So we're all learning all the time. And that's why change is fundamental in story. If things go static  stories die  because life is never static. In       I had finished writing  Toy Story  and  A Bug's Life  and I was completely hooked on screenwriting. So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could. So I researched everything I possibly could. And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright  William Archer   Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty.  It's an incredibly insightful definition. When you're telling a story  have you constructed anticipation  In the short term  have you made me want to know what will happen next  But more importantly  have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long term  Have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be  An example would be in  Finding Nemo   in the short tension  you were always worried  would Dory's short term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin. But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge  vast ocean  In our earliest days at Pixar  before we truly understood the invisible workings of story  we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut  going on our instincts. And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good. You've got to remember that in this time of year        what was considered a successful animated picture was  The Little Mermaid    Beauty and the Beast    Aladdin    Lion King.  So when we pitched  Toy Story  to Tom Hanks for the first time  he walked in and he said   You don't want me to sing  do you   And I thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time. But we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation. We didn't have any influence then  so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves. And they were  No songs  no  I want  moment  no happy village  no love story. And the irony is that  in the first year  our story was not working at all and Disney was panicking. So they privately got advice from a famous lyricist  who I won't name  and he faxed them some suggestions. And we got a hold of that fax. And the fax said  there should be songs  there should be an  I want  song  there should be a happy village song  there should be a love story and there should be a villain. And thank goodness we were just too young  rebellious and contrarian at the time. That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story. And a year after that  we did conquer it. And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines  not hard  fast rules. Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character. And we had naively thought  well Woody in  Toy Story  has to become selfless at the end  so you've got to start from someplace. So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get. Off the bed. Hey  off the bed  Mr. Potato Head  You going to make us  Woody  Woody  No  he is. Slinky  Slink ... Slinky  Get up here and do your job. Are you deaf  I said  take care of them. Slinky  I'm sorry  Woody  but I have to agree with them. I don't think what you did was right. Woody  What  Am I hearing correctly  You don't think I was right  Who said your job was to think  Spring Wiener  AS  So how do you make a selfish character likable  We realized  you can make him kind  generous  funny  considerate  as long as one condition is met for him  is that he stays the top toy. And that's what it really is  is that we all live life conditionally. We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along  as long as certain conditions are met. After that  all bets are off. And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career  I can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story. In       I truly understood the notion of story having a theme. And that was the year that they restored and re released  Lawrence of Arabia.  And I saw that thing seven times in one month. I couldn't get enough of it. I could just tell there was a grand design under it    in every shot  every scene  every line. Yet  on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on. Yet  there was something more being said. What exactly was it  And it wasn't until  on one of my later viewings  that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert and he's reached the Suez Canal  and I suddenly got it. Cyclist  Who are you  Who are you  AS  That was the theme  Who are you  Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him  but underneath it was a constant  a guideline  a road map. Everything Lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world. A strong theme is always running through a well told story. When I was five  I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that I feel a story should have  but is rarely invoked. And this is what my mother took me to when I was five. Look. The water's stiff. Bambi  Yippee  Thumper  Some fun  huh  Bambi  Come on. Get up. Like this. Ha ha. No  no  no. AS  I walked out of there wide eyed with wonder. And that's what I think the magic ingredient is  the secret sauce  is can you invoke wonder. Wonder is honest  it's completely innocent. It can't be artificially evoked. For me  there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling    to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder. When it's tapped  the affirmation of being alive  it reaches you almost to a cellular level. And when an artist does that to another artist  it's like you're compelled to pass it on. It's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you  like a call to Devil's Tower. Do unto others what's been done to you. The best stories infuse wonder. When I was four years old  I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were. And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head  but I couldn't see them because of my hair. And he explained that when I was born  I was born premature  that I came out much too early  and I wasn't fully baked  I was very  very sick. And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth  he looked straight at my mom and said   He's not going to live.  And I was in the hospital for months. And many blood transfusions later  I lived  and that made me special. I don't know if I really believe that. I don't know if my parents really believe that  but I didn't want to prove them wrong. Whatever I ended up being good at  I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given. Marlin  There  there  there. It's okay  daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise  I will never let anything happen to you  Nemo. AS  And that's the first story lesson I ever learned. Use what you know. Draw from it. It doesn't always mean plot or fact. It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it  expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core. And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTalk today. Thank you. What do I know that would cause me  a reticent  Midwestern scientist  to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting  And what would you do if you knew what I know  Let's start with how I got to this point. I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university. And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites. Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus  that there was intense microwave radiation. Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere  Or was Venus extremely hot  The right answer  confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft  was that Venus was very hot        degrees Fahrenheit. And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus. Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus  which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid. But while our instrument was being built  I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth  because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing. Eventually  I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important. Its changes will affect all of humanity. The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century. British physicist John Tyndall  in the     's  made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation  which is heat. And he showed that gasses such as CO  absorb heat  thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface. I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations. In       we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of  .  degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO . That Earth would likely warm in the     's  and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century. We also said that the   st century would see shifting climate zones  creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia  erosion of ice sheets  rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage. All of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way. That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the     's  testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle. Heatwaves and droughts on one hand  directly from the warming  but also  because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy  rainfall will become in more extreme events. There will be stronger storms and greater flooding. Global warming hoopla became time consuming and distracted me from doing science    partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony. So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others. By    years later  evidence of global warming was much stronger. Most of the things mentioned in our      paper were facts. I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force. But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels. By then we had two grandchildren  Sophie and Connor. I decided that I did not want them in the future to say   Opa understood what was happening  but he didn't make it clear.  So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy. I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in      and at the      meeting of the American Geophysical Union. This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters. After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions  NASA was forced to end the censorship. But there were consequences. I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement   To understand and protect the home planet   to justify my talks. Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted  never to appear again. Over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies  while still researching the physics of climate change. Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics    first  from Earth's energy balance and  second  from Earth's climate history. Adding CO  to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed. It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space  so there's a temporary energy imbalance. More energy is coming in than going out  until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun. So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance. Is there more energy coming in than going out  If so  more warming is in the pipeline. It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses. Now finally  we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs. The biggest reservoir  the ocean  was the least well measured  until more than       Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean. These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate. The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate  and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet. And the land  to depths of tens of meters  is also warming. The total energy imbalance now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter. That may not sound like much  but when added up over the whole world  it's enormous. It's about    times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity. It's equivalent to exploding         Hiroshima atomic bombs per day     days per year. That's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day. This imbalance  if we want to stabilize climate  means that we must reduce CO  from     ppm  parts per million  back to     ppm. That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming. Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change. But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record  when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least. Yet  there was more energy coming in than going out. This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses  mainly from burning fossil fuels. Now consider Earth's climate history. These curves for global temperature  atmospheric CO  and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores  from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over         years forming a two mile thick ice sheet. As you see  there's a high correlation between temperature  CO  and sea level. Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO  changes by a few centuries. Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying   Look  the temperature causes CO  to change  not vice versa.  But that lag is exactly what is expected. Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth. When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer  ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker  so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO   just as a warm Coca Cola does. And more CO  causes more warming. So CO   methane  and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge  even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing. The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms  now because of extra CO  we put in the atmosphere  ice will melt  and CO  and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur  it is certain they will occur  unless we stop the warming. There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by GRACE  the gravity satellite  reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass  several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost. What sea level rise can we look forward to  The last time CO  was     ppm  today's value  sea level was higher by at least    meters     feet. Where you are sitting now would be under water. Most estimates are that  this century  we will get at least one meter. I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels  perhaps even five meters  which is    feet  this century or shortly thereafter. The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries. There would be no stable shoreline. The economic consequences are almost unthinkable. Hundreds of New Orleans like devastations around the world. What may be more reprehensible  if climate denial continues  is extermination of species. The monarch butterfly could be one of the    to    percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use. Global warming is already affecting people. The Texas  Oklahoma  Mexico heatwave and drought last year  Moscow the year before and Europe in       were all exceptional events  more than three standard deviations outside the norm. Fifty years ago  such anomalies covered only two  to three tenths of one percent of the land area. In recent years  because of global warming  they now cover about    percent    an increase by a factor of    to   . So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural  they were caused by global warming. An important impact  if global warming continues  will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world  the Midwest and Great Plains  which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts  worse than the Dust Bowl  within just a few decades  if we let global warming continue. How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate  giving talks in    countries  getting arrested  burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over    years  More grandchildren helped me along. Jake is a super positive  enthusiastic boy. Here at age two and a half years  he thinks he can protect his two and a half day old little sister. It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control. Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple  honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed     percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis  with the government not keeping one dime. Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they'd pay in increased prices. This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations  creating millions of jobs. It is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future. Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition. Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly   Transparent. Market based. Does not enlarge government. Leaves energy decisions to individual choices. Sounds like a conservative climate plan.  But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society  our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by     to     billion dollars per year worldwide  thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel    mountaintop removal  longwall mining  fracking  tar sands  tar shale  deep ocean Arctic drilling. This path  if continued  guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations. A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction. And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world  causing massive famines and economic decline. Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth. That is the equivalent of what we face now. Yet  we dither  taking no action to divert the asteroid  even though the longer we wait  the more difficult and expensive it becomes. If we had started in       it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century. If we start next year  it is six percent per year. If we wait    years  it is    percent per year    extremely difficult and expensive  perhaps impossible. But we aren't even starting. So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm. Clearly  I haven't gotten this message across. The science is clear. I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively. We owe it to our children and grandchildren. Thank you. So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate  we have them work in government. The program is called Code for America  and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments. Instead of sending them off into the Third World  we send them into the wilds of City Hall. And there they make great apps  they work with city staffers. But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today. So meet Al. Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston. Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow. Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner  We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program. They were there in February  and it snowed a lot in February last year. And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants. But one fellow in particular  a guy named Erik Michaels Ober  noticed something else  and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things. So he did what any good developer would do  he wrote an app. It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant. So you agree to dig it out when it snows. If you do  you get to name it  and he called the first one Al. And if you don't  someone can steal it from you. So it's got cute little game dynamics on it. This is a modest little app. It's probably the smallest of the    apps that the fellows wrote last year. But it's doing something that no other government technology does. It's spreading virally. There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it  not for snow  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens. It's very important that these tsunami sirens work  but people steal the batteries out of them. So he's getting citizens to check on them. And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains. And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this. And this has spread just frictionlessly  organically  naturally. If you know anything about government technology  you know that this isn't how it normally goes. Procuring software usually takes a couple of years. We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months. It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids. We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels  it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars. And that's nothing. There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars  and it doesn't work. And there are projects like this at every level of government. So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally  that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government. It suggests how government could work better    not more like a private company  as many people think it should. And not even like a tech company  but more like the Internet itself. And that means permissionless  it means open  it means generative. And that's important. But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government    not as the problem of an ossified institution  but as a problem of collective action. And that's great news  because  it turns out  we're very good at collective action with digital technology. Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively. It's not just Code for America fellows  there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities. They haven't given up on government. They are frustrated as hell with it  but they're not complaining about it  they're fixing it. And these folks know something that we've lost sight of. And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we're really mad about  government is  at its core  in the words of Tim O'Reilly   What we do together that we can't do alone.  Now a lot of people have given up on government. And if you're one of those people  I would ask that you reconsider  because things are changing. Politics is not changing  government is changing. And because government ultimately derives its power from us    remember  We the people      how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens. Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program. And like a lot of people  I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. Well after two years  I've come to the conclusion that  especially local government  is about opossums. This is the call center for the services and information line. It's generally where you will get if you call     in your city. If you should ever have the chance to staff your city's call center  as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program    in fact  they all do that    you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues  including having an opossum stuck in your house. So Scott gets this call. He types  Opossum  into this official knowledge base. He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control. And finally  he says   Look  can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves   So that worked. So booya for Scott. But that wasn't the end of the opossums. Boston doesn't just have a call center. It has an app  a Web and mobile app  called Citizens Connect. Now we didn't write this app. This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston. So one day    this is an actual report    this came in   Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead. How do I get this removed   But what happens with Citizens Connect is different. So Scott was speaking person to person. But on Citizens Connect everything is public  so everybody can see this. And in this case  a neighbor saw it. And the next report we got said   I walked over to this location  found the trashcan behind the house. Opossum  Check. Living  Yep. Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. Goodnight sweet opossum.  Pretty simple. So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical. And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd sourcing game. But it's also a great example of government as a platform. And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here. I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others. So one citizen helped another citizen  but government played a key role here. It connected those two people. And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services. When one neighbor helps another  we strengthen our communities. We call animal control  it just costs a lot of money. Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics. And most people get that  but they think that one is the input to the other. That our input to the system of government is voting. Now how many times have we elected a political leader    and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected    and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs  and then not that much changes  That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six inch layer on top. And what's under that is what we call bureaucracy. And we say that word with such contempt. But it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us  this other thing  and then we're disempowering ourselves. People seem to think politics is sexy. If we want this institution to work for us  we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy. Because that's where the real work of government happens. We have to engage with the machinery of government. So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done. Have you seen these guys  It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed     page report that's a response to the SEC's request for comment on the Financial Reform Bill. That's not being politically active  that's being bureaucratically active. Now for those of us who've given up on government  it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children. You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face. Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us  We can't do without government  but we do need it to be more effective. The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society. And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet  and they know that it's not that hard to do things together  you just have to architect the systems the right way. Now the average age of our fellows is     so I am  begrudgingly  almost a generation older than most of them. This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak  they all get to speak. They can express their opinion on any channel at any time  and they do. So when they're faced with the problem of government  they don't care as much about using their voices. They're using their hands. They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better. And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better. That could be shoveling out a hydrant  pulling a weed  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it. And certainly  we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along  and many people do. But these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers  and we're not just consumers of government  putting in our taxes and getting back services. We're more than that  we're citizens. And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship. So the question I have for all of you here  When it comes to the big  important things that we need to do together  all of us together  are we just going to be a crowd of voices  or are we also going to be a crowd of hands  Thank you. I want to discuss with you this afternoon why you're going to fail to have a great career. I'm an economist. I do dismal. End of the day  it's ready for dismal remarks. I only want to talk to those of you who want a great career. I know some of you have already decided you want a good career. You're going to fail  too. Because    goodness  you're all cheery about failing. Canadian group  undoubtedly. Those trying to have good careers are going to fail  because  really  good jobs are now disappearing. There are great jobs and great careers  and then there are the high workload  high stress  bloodsucking  soul destroying kinds of jobs  and practically nothing in between. So people looking for good jobs are going to fail. I want to talk about those looking for great jobs  great careers  and why you're going to fail. First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you   If you want a great career  you have to pursue your passion  you have to pursue your dreams  you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life   you hear it again and again  and then you decide not to do it. It doesn't matter how many times you download Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address  you still look at it and decide not to do it. I'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it. You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard. You're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it  you'll feel like you're an idiot  so then you make excuses about why you're not going to look for your passion. They are excuses  ladies and gentlemen. We're going to go through a whole long list    your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career. So  for example  one of your great excuses is   Well  great careers are really and truly  for most people  just a matter of luck. So I'm going to stand around  I'm going to try to be lucky  and if I'm lucky  I'll have a great career. If not  I'll have a good career.  But a good career is an impossibility  so that's not going to work. Then  your other excuse is   Yes  there are special people who pursue their passions  but they are geniuses. They are Steven J. I'm not a genius. When I was five  I thought I was a genius  but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since.   And now I know I am completely competent.  Now  you see  if this was       being completely competent    that would have given you a great career. But guess what  This is almost       and saying to the world   I am totally  completely competent   is damning yourself with the faintest of praise. And then  of course  another excuse   Well  I would do this  I would do this  but  but    well  after all  I'm not weird. Everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive. A little strange. Hmm  Hmm  Okay  You know  a fine line between madness and genius.  I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography. Oh my goodness    I'm not that person. I am nice. I am normal. I'm a nice  normal person  and nice  normal people    don't have passion.   Ah  but I still want a great career. I'm not prepared to pursue my passion  so I know what I'm going to do  because I have a solution. I have a strategy. It's the one Mommy and Daddy told me about. Mommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard  I'd have a good career. So  if you work hard and have a good career  if you work really  really  really hard  you'll have a great career. Doesn't that  like  mathematically make sense   Hmm. Not. But you've managed to talk yourself into that. You know what  Here's a little secret  You want to work  You want to work really  really  really hard  You know what  You'll succeed. The world will give you the opportunity to work really  really  really  really hard. But  are you so sure that that's going to give you a great career  when all the evidence is to the contrary  So let's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion. You actually understand that you really had better do it  never mind the excuses. You're trying to find your passion    and you're so happy. You found something you're interested in.  I have an interest  I have an interest   You tell me. You say   I have an interest   I say   That's wonderful  And what are you trying to tell me    Well  I have an interest.  I say   Do you have passion    I have an interest   you say.  Your interest is compared to what    Well  I'm interested in this.   And what about the rest of humanity's activities    I'm not interested in them.   You've looked at them all  have you    No. Not exactly.  Passion is your greatest love. Passion is the thing that will help you create the highest expression of your talent. Passion  interest    it's not the same thing. Are you really going to go to your sweetie and say   Marry me  You're interesting.  Won't happen. Won't happen  and you will die alone. What you want  what you want  what you want  is passion. It is beyond interest. You need    interests  and then one of them  one of them might grab you  one of them might engage you more than anything else  and then you may have found your greatest love  in comparison to all the other things that interest you  and that's what passion is. I have a friend  proposed to his sweetie. He was an economically rational person. He said to his sweetie   Let us marry. Let us merge our interests.  Yes  he did.  I love you truly   he said.  I love you deeply. I love you more than any other woman I've ever encountered. I love you more than Mary  Jane  Susie  Penelope  Ingrid  Gertrude  Gretel    I was on a German exchange program then. I love you more than     All right. She left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her. After he got over his surprise at being  you know  turned down  he concluded he'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person. Although  he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed  it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part. But the point stands. You must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny  or are you afraid of the word  destiny   Does the word  destiny  scare you  That's what we're talking about. And if you don't find the highest expression of your talent  if you settle for  interesting   what the hell ever that means  do you know what will happen at the end of your long life  Your friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery  and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone  and inscribed on that tombstone it will say   Here lies a distinguished engineer  who invented Velcro.  But what that tombstone should have said  in an alternative lifetime  what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent  was   Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics  who formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive.  Velcro  indeed  One was a great career. One was a missed opportunity. But then  there are some of you who  in spite of all these excuses  you will find  you will find your passion. And you'll still fail. You're going to fail  because    because you're not going to do it  because you will have invented a new excuse  any excuse to fail to take action  and this excuse  I've heard so many times   Yes  I would pursue a great career  but  I value human relationships    more than accomplishment. I want to be a great friend. I want to be a great spouse. I want to be a great parent  and I will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment.  What do you want me to say  Now  do you really want me to say now  tell you   Really  I swear I don't kick children.  Look at the worldview you've given yourself. You're a hero no matter what. And I  by suggesting ever so delicately that you might want a great career  must hate children. I don't hate children. I don't kick them. Yes  there was a little kid wandering through this building when I came here  and no  I didn't kick him. Course  I had to tell him the building was for adults only  and to get out. He mumbled something about his mother  and I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway. Last time I saw him  he was on the stairs crying. What a wimp. But what do you mean  That's what you expect me to say. Do you really think it's appropriate that you should actually take children and use them as a shield  You know what will happen someday  you ideal parent  you  The kid will come to you someday and say   I know what I want to be. I know what I'm going to do with my life.  You are so happy. It's the conversation a parent wants to hear  because your kid's good in math  and you know you're going to like what comes next. Says your kid   I have decided I want to be a magician. I want to perform magic tricks on the stage.  And what do you say  You say  you say   That's risky  kid. Might fail  kid. Don't make a lot of money at that  kid. I don't know  kid  you should think about that again  kid. You're so good at math  why don't you     The kid interrupts you and says   But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this.  And what are you going to say  You know what you're going to say   Look kid. I had a dream once  too  but    But     So how are you going to finish the sentence with your  but    But. I had a dream too  once  kid  but I was afraid to pursue it.  Or are you going to tell him this   I had a dream once  kid. But then  you were born.  Do you really want to use your family  do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid  and see your jailers  There was something you could have said to your kid  when he or she said   I have a dream.  You could have said    looked the kid in the face and said   Go for it  kid  Just like I did.  But you won't be able to say that  because you didn't. So you can't. And so the sins of the parents are visited on the poor children. Why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse not to find and pursue your passion  You know why. In your heart of hearts  you know why  and I'm being deadly serious. You know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships. It is because you are    you know what you are. You're afraid to pursue your passion. You're afraid to look ridiculous. You're afraid to try. You're afraid you may fail. Great friend  great spouse  great parent  great career. Is that not a package  Is that not who you are  How can you be one without the other  But you're afraid. And that's why you're not going to have a great career. Unless     unless   that most evocative of all English words     unless.  But the  unless  word is also attached to that other  most terrifying phrase   If only I had ...   If only I had ...  If you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain  it will hurt a lot. So  those are the many reasons why you are going to fail to have a great career. Unless    Unless. Thank you. I have a question for you  Are you religious  Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person. Let's see  I'd say about three or four percent. I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference. Okay  here's another question  Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way  shape or form  Raise your hand. Okay  that's the majority. My Talk today is about the main reason  or one of the main reasons  why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way  shape or form. My Talk today is about self transcendence. It's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away. And when that happens  the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings. We talk about being uplifted or elevated. Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor. So here's the metaphor I'm offering today. Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms  most of which we're very familiar with. But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase. We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness. In       the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience. He collected all kinds of case studies. He quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences. One of the most exciting to me is this young man  Stephen Bradley  had an encounter  he thought  with Jesus in     . And here's what Bradley said about it. for about one second in the room  with arms extended  appearing to say to me   Come.  The next day I rejoiced with trembling. My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die. This world had no place in my affections. Previous to this time  I was very selfish and self righteous. But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could  with a feeling heart  forgive my worst enemies. JH  So note how Bradley's petty  moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase. And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving. The world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase. Some shut down the self using meditation. Others use psychedelic drugs. This is from a   th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god. Others use dancing  spinning and circling to promote self transcendence. But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase. Lots of people find self transcendence in nature. Others overcome their self at raves. But here's the weirdest place of all  war. So many books about war say the same thing  that nothing brings people together like war. And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self transcendent experiences. I'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray. Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II. And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle. Here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase. that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives.  I  passes insensibly into a  we    my  becomes  our  and individual faith loses its central importance. I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy. I may fall  but I do not die  for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life. JH  So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out  or melt away  and it feels good  it feels really good  in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives. It feels somehow uplifting. This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim. Durkheim even called us Homo duplex  or two level man. The lower level he called the level of the profane. Now profane is the opposite of sacred. It just means ordinary or common. And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals. We want to satisfy our individual desires. We pursue our individual goals. But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change. Individuals unite into a team  a movement or a nation  which is far more than the sum of its parts. Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group  into a moral community. Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness. And once people circle around some sacred object or value  they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it. Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum  of making a group out of individuals. Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended. Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square  which brought down a dictator. And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt  that brought us all together  after     . So let me summarize where we are. I'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human. I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind. I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred. When we climb that staircase  self interest fades away  we become just much less self interested  and we feel as though we are better  nobler and somehow uplifted. So here's the million dollar question for social scientists like me  Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design  Is it a product of natural selection  like our hands  Or is it a bug  a mistake in the system    this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain    Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience  it's just a mistake  Well many scientists who study religion take this view. The New Atheists  for example  argue that religion is a set of memes  sort of parasitic memes  that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff  self destructive stuff  like suicide bombing. And after all  how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves  How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self interest  Well let me show you. In  The Descent of Man   Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality    where did it come from  why do we have it. Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves  but they're of great use to our groups. He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition. He said   If the one tribe included a great number of courageous  sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other  this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other.  He went on to say that  Selfish and contentious people will not cohere  and without coherence nothing can be effected.  In other words  Charles Darwin believed in group selection. Now this idea has been very controversial for the last    years  but it's about to make a major comeback this year  especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April  making a very strong case that we  and several other species  are products of group selection. But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection. So look at it this way  You've got competition going on within groups and across groups. So here's a group of guys on a college crew team. Within this team there's competition. There are guys competing with each other. The slowest rowers  the weakest rowers  are going to get cut from the team. And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport. Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics. So within the team  their interests are actually pitted against each other. And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys. Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach. But while that competition is going on within the boat  this competition is going on across boats. And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat  now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat. They can only win if they all pull together as a team. I mean  these things sound trite  but they are deep evolutionary truths. The main argument against group selection has always been that  well sure  it would be nice to have a group of cooperators  but as soon as you have a group of cooperators  they're just going to get taken over by free riders  individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others. Let me illustrate this for you. Suppose we've got a group of little organisms    they can be bacteria  they can be hamsters  it doesn't matter what    and let's suppose that this little group here  they evolved to be cooperative. Well that's great. They graze  they defend each other  they work together  they generate wealth. And as you'll see in this simulation  as they interact they gain points  as it were  they grow  and when they've doubled in size  you'll see them split  and that's how they reproduce and the population grows. But suppose then that one of them mutates. There's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy. It takes advantage of the others. And so when a green interacts with a blue  you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller. So here's how things play out. We start with just one green  and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food. And in short order  the cooperators are done for. The free riders have taken over. If a group cannot solve the free rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started. But there are solutions to the free rider problem. It's not that hard a problem. In fact  nature has solved it many  many times. And nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat. For example  why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA  totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus  It's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism. Somehow or other    maybe one swallowed another  we'll never know exactly why    but once they got a membrane around them  they were all in the same membrane  now all the wealth created division of labor  all the greatness created by cooperation  stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism. And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders  of defectors  of cheaters and look what happens. A superorganism can basically take what it wants. It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens  from the defectors  the cheaters. And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms. What I've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history. Darwin's laws don't change  but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different. Now this transition was not a one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria. It happened again about     or a     million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple  primitive nests  or hives. Once several wasps were all together in the same hive  they had no choice but to cooperate  because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives. And the most cohesive hives won  just as Darwin said. These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere. And it happened again  even more spectacularly  in the last half million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures  they came together around a hearth or a campfire  they divided labor  they began painting their bodies  they spoke their own dialects  and eventually they worshiped their own gods. Once they were all in the same tribe  they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside. And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet  which is human cooperation    a force for construction and destruction. Of course  human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives. Human groups may look like hives for brief moments  but they tend to then break apart. We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are. In fact  often  as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts  often those divisions are along religious lines. Nonetheless  when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement  they can move mountains. Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you. Do you think they're there pursuing their self interest  Or are they pursuing communal interest  which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole  Okay  so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way. And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full spectrum sort of way. of religious experience  as William James explained. One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves. The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred  or deeply interconnected. We are Homo duplex  as Durkheim explained. And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection  as Darwin explained. I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug  but if it is an adaptation  then the implications are profound. If it is an adaptation  then we evolved to be religious. I don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions. Those things came along too recently. I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects  people and ideas. This is why politics is so tribal. Politics is partly profane  it's partly about self interest  but politics is also about sacredness. It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas. It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil  and we all believe we're on the good team. And most importantly  if the staircase is real  it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life. Because human beings are  to some extent  hivish creatures like bees. We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment. We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed. We unleashed Earth changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort. Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom. But sometimes we wonder  Is this all there is  What should I do with my life  What's missing  What's missing is that we are Homo duplex  but modern  secular society was built to satisfy our lower  profane selves. It's really comfortable down here on the lower level. Come  have a seat in my home entertainment center. One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top. I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia. They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into. They're all searching for their staircase. And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish. Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger. And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly     years ago.  No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent  a part of the main.  JH  Thank you. The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. And I think some dispassionate  quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. I'd therefore like to propose that we employ  we enlist  the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject. For instance  just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses    billion dollars a year to copyright theft. Now rather than just argue about this number  a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin  and then to Mars ... ... if we use pennies. Now this is obviously a powerful  some might say dangerously powerful  insight. But it's also a morally important one. Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about  but this is actual economic losses. This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops  as well as wheat  tobacco  rice  sorghum    whatever sorghum is    losing sorghum. But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. But total movie revenues across theaters  home video and pay per view are up. And TV  satellite and cable revenues are way up. Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. So this small missing chunk here is puzzling. Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms  it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented  but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms    one that didn't exist in the   's. What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.    billion dollars of it a year  which is enough  at    seconds a ringtone  that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. It's true. I have Excel. The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over         jobs to content theft  which is quite a lot when you consider that  back in '    the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing         people. Other data has the music industry at about        people. And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft  have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. And this is just one of the many mind blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. And some people think that string theory is tough. Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. Some people think this number's a little bit large  but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year. Now when this law first passed  the world's hottest MP  player could hold just    songs. And it was a big Christmas hit. Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks worth of stolen goods in his pocket. These days an iPod Classic can hold        songs  which is to say eight billion dollars worth of stolen media. Or about        jobs. Now you might find copyright math strange  but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. So that's it for now. I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk. I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life. And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days. The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch. And when I walked in  she was already at the table. I sat down  and she said   God  you look like hell.  I said   Thanks. I feel really    I'm not functioning.  And she said   What's going on   And I said   I just told     people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability. And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data  as absolutely essential to whole hearted living  I told these     people that I had a breakdown. I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.' At what point did I think that was a good idea   And she said   I saw your talk live streamed. It was not really you. It was a little different than what you usually do. But it was great.  And I said   This can't happen. YouTube  they're putting this thing on YouTube. And we're going to be talking about          people.  And she said   Well  I think it's too late.  And I said   Let me ask you something.  And she said   Yeah.  I said   Do you remember when we were in college  really wild and kind of dumb   She said   Yeah.  I said   Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex boyfriend's answering machine  Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape   And she goes   Uh... no.  Of course  the only thing I could say at that point was   Yeah  me neither. Yeah    me neither.  And I'm thinking to myself   Bren   what are you doing  Why did you bring this up  Have you lost your mind  Your sisters would be perfect for this.  So I looked back up and she said   Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube   And I said   I'm just thinking about it a little bit.  She said   You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever.  Then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic  but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.  If     turns into       or        my life is over.  I had no contingency plan for four million. And my life did end when that happened. And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself  and that was that  as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world  there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small  staying right under the radar. But I want to talk about what I've learned. There's two things that I've learned in the last year. The first is  vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous. Let me ask you honestly    and I'll give you this warning  I'm trained as a therapist  so I can out wait you uncomfortably    so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome    how many of you honestly  when you're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think   God  vulnerability is weakness.  How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously  The majority of people. Now let me ask you this question  This past week at TED  how many of you  when you saw vulnerability up here  thought it was pure courage  Vulnerability is not weakness. I define vulnerability as emotional risk  exposure  uncertainty. It fuels our daily lives. And I've come to the belief    this is my   th year doing this research    that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage    to be vulnerable  to let ourselves be seen  to be honest. One of the weird things that's happened is  after the TED explosion  I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country    everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune     companies. And so many of the calls went like this   Dr. Brown  we loved your TED talk. We'd like you to come in and speak. We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame.  What would you like for me to talk about  There's three big answers. This is mostly  to be honest with you  from the business sector  innovation  creativity and change. So let me go on the record and say  vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation  creativity and change. To create is to make something that has never existed before. There's nothing more vulnerable than that. Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability. The second thing  in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage  the second thing I learned  is this  We have to talk about shame. And I'm going to be really honest with you. When I became a  vulnerability researcher  and that became the focus because of the TED talk    and I'm not kidding. I'll give you an example. About three months ago  I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store. About from a hundred feet away  this is what I hear   Vulnerability TED  Vulnerability TED   I'm a fifth generation Texan. Our family motto is  Lock and load.  I am not a natural vulnerability researcher. So I'm like  just keep walking  she's on my six. And then I hear   Vulnerability TED   I turn around  I go   Hi.  She's right here and she said   You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown.  At this point  parents are  like  pulling their children close.  Look away.  And I'm so worn out at this point in my life  I look at her and I actually say   It was a fricking spiritual awakening.  And she looks back and does this   I know.  And she said   We watched your TED talk in my book club. Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'  And she said   Our tagline is  'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'  You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting. So when I became Vulnerability TED  like an action figure    Like Ninja Barbie  but I'm Vulnerability TED    I thought  I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind  because I spent six years studying shame before I started writing and talking about vulnerability. And I thought  thank God  because shame is this horrible topic  no one wants to talk about it. It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.  What do you do    I study shame.   Oh.  And I see you. But in surviving this last year  I was reminded of a cardinal rule    not a research rule  but a moral imperative from my upbringing     you've got to dance with the one who brung ya . And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability. I learned about these things from studying shame. And so I want to walk you in to shame. Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul. And we're going to walk in. And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there. It is to put on some galoshes    and walk through and find our way around. Here's why. We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country  and I think globally  around race  right  Yes  We heard that. Yes  Cannot have that conversation without shame. Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege. And when people start talking about privilege  they get paralyzed by shame. We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery  which is  have a checklist. You can't fix that problem without addressing shame  because when they teach those folks how to suture  they also teach them how to stitch their self worth to being all powerful. And all powerful folks don't need checklists. And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here. Myshkin Ingawale  I hope I did right by you. I saw the TED Fellows my first day here. And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia  because people were dying unnecessarily. And he said   I saw this need. So you know what I did  I made it.  And everybody just burst into applause  and they were like  Yes   And he said   And it didn't work. And then I made it    more times  and then it worked.  You know what the big secret about TED is  I can't wait to tell people this. I guess I'm doing it right now. This is like the failure conference. No  it is. You know why this place is amazing  Because very few people here are afraid to fail. And no one who gets on the stage  so far that I've seen  has not failed. I've failed miserably  many times. I don't think the world understands that  because of shame. There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt. A lot of people refer to it as the  Man in the Arena  quote. And it goes like this   It is not the critic who counts. It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles. The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat. But when he's in the arena  at best  he wins  and at worst  he loses  but when he fails  when he loses  he does so daring greatly.  And that's what this conference  to me  is about. Life is about daring greatly  about being in the arena. When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door  and you think   I'm going in and I'm going to try this   shame is the gremlin who says   Uh  uh. You're not good enough. You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you. I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg  he was in Sing Sing. I know those things that happened to you growing up. I know you don't think that you're pretty  smart  talented or powerful enough. I know your dad never paid attention  even when you made CFO.  Shame is that thing. And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say   I'm going to do this   we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing     percent of the time is who  Us. Shame drives two big tapes     never good enough     and  if you can talk it out of that one   who do you think you are   The thing to understand about shame is  it's not guilt. Shame is a focus on self  guilt is a focus on behavior. Shame is  I am bad.  Guilt is  I did something bad.  How many of you  if you did something that was hurtful to me  would be willing to say   I'm sorry. I made a mistake   How many of you would be willing to say that  Guilt  I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Shame  I'm sorry. I am a mistake. There's a huge difference between shame and guilt. And here's what you need to know. Shame is highly  highly correlated with addiction  depression  violence  aggression  bullying  suicide  eating disorders. And here's what you even need to know more. Guilt  inversely correlated with those things. The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive. It's uncomfortable  but it's adaptive. The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender. If shame washes over me and washes over Chris  it's going to feel the same. Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame. We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy. Which means  yes  I have a little shame  no  I'm a sociopath. So I would opt for  yes  you have a little shame. Shame feels the same for men and women  but it's organized by gender. For women  the best example I can give you is Enjoli  the commercial.  I can put the wash on the line  pack the lunches  hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine. I can bring home the bacon  fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man.  For women  shame is  do it all  do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat. I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold  but I guarantee you  it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds. Shame  for women  is this web of unobtainable  conflicting  competing expectations about who we're supposed to be. And it's a straight jacket. For men  shame is not a bunch of competing  conflicting expectations. Shame is one  do not be perceived as what  Weak. I did not interview men for the first four years of my study. It wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing  and said   I love what say about shame  I'm curious why you didn't mention men.  And I said   I don't study men.  And he said   That's convenient.  And I said   Why   And he said   Because you say to reach out  tell our story  be vulnerable. But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters   I said   Yeah.   They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable  we get the shit beat out of us. And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads. Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else.  So I started interviewing men and asking questions. And what I learned is this  You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear  I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work. You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it  she can't do it all anymore  and his first response is not   I unloaded the dishwasher   But he really listens    because that's all we need    I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work. Shame is an epidemic in our culture. And to get out from underneath it    to find our way back to each other  we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting  the way we're working  the way we're looking at each other. Very quickly  some research by Mahalik at Boston College. He asked  what do women need to do to conform to female norms  The top answers in this country  nice  thin  modest and use all available resources for appearance. When he asked about men  what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms  the answers were  always show emotional control  work is first  pursue status and violence. If we're going to find our way back to each other  we have to understand and know empathy  because empathy's the antidote to shame. If you put shame in a Petri dish  it needs three things to grow exponentially  secrecy  silence and judgment. If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy  it can't survive. The two most powerful words when we're in struggle  me too. And so I'll leave you with this thought. If we're going to find our way back to each other  vulnerability is going to be that path. And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena  because I think I did it my whole life  and think to myself  I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect. And that is seductive. But the truth is  that never happens. And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there  that's not what we want to see. We want you to go in. We want to be with you and across from you. And we just want  for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with  to dare greatly. So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it. I'm a believer. I'm a believer in global warming  and my record is good on the subject. But my subject is national security. We have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy. I'm talking about OPEC oil. And let me take you back     years to     . You're probably thinking that was my birth year. It wasn't. It was     . But go back to           years ago  and look at that point what we  our country  was faced with. It's the same energy question that you're looking at today  but it's different sources of fuel. A hundred years ago we were looking at coal  of course  and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil. At that point  we were looking for a fuel that was cleaner  it was cheaper  and it wasn't ours though  it was theirs. So at that point        we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal. But as we moved on to the period now      years later  we're back really at another decision point. What is the decision point  It's what we're going to use in the future. So from here  it's pretty clear to me  we would prefer to have cleaner  cheaper  domestic  ours    and we have that  we have that    which is natural gas. So here you are  that the cost of all this to the world is    million barrels of oil  give or take a few barrels  every day. And the cost annually is three trillion dollars. And one trillion of that goes to OPEC. That has got to be stopped. Now if you look at the cost of OPEC  it cost seven trillion dollars    on the Milken Institute study last year    seven trillion dollars since       is what we paid for oil from OPEC. Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both. But it's the greatest transfer of wealth  from one group to another in the history of mankind. And it continues. Now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth  you can see here that we have the arrows going into the Mid East and away from us. And with that  we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen. We are policing the world  and how are we doing that  I know the response to this. I would bet there aren't    percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world. Raise your hand if you think you know. There are   . One is under construction by the Chinese and the other    belong to us. Why do we have    aircraft carriers  Do we have a corner on the market  Are we smarter than anybody else  I'm not sure. If you look at where they're located    and on this slide it's the red blobs on there    there are five that are operating in the Mid East  and the rest of them are in the United States. They just move back to the Mid East and those come back. So actually most of the    we have are tied up in the Mid East. Why  Why are they in the Mid East  They're there to control  keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available. And the United States uses about    million barrels a day  which is about    percent of all the oil used everyday in the world. And we're doing it with four percent of the population. Somehow that doesn't seem right. That's not sustainable. So where do we go from here  Does that continue  Yes  it's going to continue. The slide you're looking at here is      to     . Over that period you are going to double your demand. And when you look at what we're using the oil for     percent of it is used for transportation fuel. So when somebody says   Let's go more nuclear  let's go wind  let's go solar   fine  I'm for anything American  anything American. But if you're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil  you have to address transportation. So here we are using    million barrels a day    producing eight  importing     and from the     five comes from OPEC. When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user  we use    million barrels and the Chinese use   . The Chinese have a little bit better plan    or they have a plan  we have no plan. In the history of America  we've never had an energy plan. We don't even realize the resources that we have available to us. If you take the last    years and bring forward  you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars. If you go forward the next    years and cap the price of oil at     dollars a barrel  you will pay  .  trillion. That's not sustainable either. But the days of cheap oil are over. They're over. They make it very clear to you  the Saudis do  they have to have    dollars a barrel to make their social commitments. Now I had people in Washington last week told me  he said   The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel. That has nothing to do with it. It's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil.  There is no free market for oil. The oil is priced off the margin. And the OPEC nations are the ones that price the oil. So where are we headed from here  We're headed to natural gas. Natural gas will do everything we want it to do. It's     octane fuel. It's    percent cleaner than oil. It's ours  we have an abundance of it. And it does not require a refinery. It comes out of the ground at     octane. Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it. It's going to be very simple for us to use. It's going to be simple to accomplish this. You're going to find  and I'll tell you in just a minute  what you're looking for to make it happen. But here you can look at the list. Natural gas will fit all of those. It will replace or be able to be used for that. It's for power generation  transportation  it's peaking fuel  it's all those. Do we have enough natural gas  Look at the bar on the left. It's    trillion. It's what we use a year. Go forward and the estimates that you have from the EIA and onto the industry estimates    the industry knows what they're talking about    we've got       trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us. How does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent  It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have. And they claim they have     billion barrels of oil  which I do not believe. I think it's probably     billion barrels. But anyway  whether they say they're right or whatever  we have plenty of natural gas. So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas. And where I've targeted is on the heavy duty trucks. There are eight million of them. You take eight million trucks    these are    wheelers    and take them to natural gas  reduce carbon by    percent  it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels. So you will cut    percent off of OPEC with eight million trucks. There are     million vehicles in America. So what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel  is the way I see it. I don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age. That's your concern. But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas  because you have plenty of natural gas. But as I said  I'm for anything American. Now let me take you    I've been a realist    I went from theorist early to realist. I'm back to theorist again. If you look at the world  you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent. And here you can see methane  if that's the way you're going to go  that there's plenty of methane    natural gas is methane  methane and natural gas are interchangeable    but if you decide that you're going to use some methane    and I'm gone  so it's up to you    but we do have plenty of methane hydrates. So I think I've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in America. If we do    it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil. And yet  we have no energy plan. So there's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan  other than I'm trying to focus on that eight million    wheelers. If we could do that  I think we would take our first step to an energy plan. If we did  we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thanks for that. So from your point of view  you had this great Pickens Plan that was based on wind energy  and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed. What happened  TBP  I lost     million dollars. That'll make you abandon something. No  what happened to us  Chris  is that power  it's priced off the margin. And so the margin is natural gas. And at the time I went into the wind business  natural gas was nine dollars. Today it's two dollars and forty cents. You cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an MCF. CA  So what happened was that  through increased ability to use fracking technology  the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted  which made wind uncompetitive. In a nutshell that's what happened  TBP  That's what happened. We found out that we could go to the source rock  which were the carboniferous shales in the basins. The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York  Pennsylvania  West Virginia  and Haynesville in Louisiana. This stuff is everywhere. We are overwhelmed with natural gas. CA  And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market  TBP  Well you say a big investor. It's my life. I'm a geologist  got out of school in '    and I've been in the industry my entire life. Now I do own stocks. I'm not a big natural gas producer. Somebody the other day said I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States. Don't I wish. But no  I'm not. I own stocks. But I also am in the fueling business. CA  But natural gas is a fossil fuel. You burn it  you release CO . So you believe in the threat of climate change. Why doesn't that prospect concern you  TBP  Well you're going to have to use something. What do you have to replace it  CA  No  no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense  because the amount of CO  per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal  correct  And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas. But if that's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don't get invested in  then  long term  we're screwed anyway  right  TBP  Well I'm not ready to give up  but Jim and I talked there as he left  and I said   How do you feel about natural gas   And he said   Well it's a bridge fuel  is what it is.  And I said   Bridge to what  Where are we headed   See but again  I told you  I don't have to worry with that. You all do. CA  But I don't think that's right  Boone. I think you're a person who believes in your legacy. You've made the money you need. You're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate. Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon  Does that make sense  TBP  I don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program. I can tell you it will be a failure. The government is not successful on these things. They just aren't  it's a bad deal. Look at Solyndra  or whatever it was. I mean  that was told to be a bad idea    times  they went ahead and did it anyway. But that only blew out     million. I think it's closer to a billion. But Chris  I think where we're headed  the long term  I don't mind going back to nuclear. And I can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be. One  don't build a reformer on a fault. And number two  do not build a reformer on the ocean. And now I think reformers are safe. Move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers. There isn't anything wrong with nuke. You're going to have to have energy. There is no question. You can't    okay. CA  One of the questions from the audience is  with fracking and the natural gas process  what about the problem of methane leaking from that  methane being a worse global warming gas than CO   Is that a concern  TBP  Fracking  What is fracking  CA  Fracking. TBP  I'm teasing. CA  We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here  you know. TBP  No  let me tell you  I've told you what my age was. I got out of school in '  . I witnessed my first frack job at border Texas in     . Fracking came out in '    and don't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the Department of Energy    years ago developed fracking. I don't know what in the hell he's talking about. I mean seriously  the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking. The first frack job was in '  . I saw my first one in '  . I've fracked over       wells in my life. Never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else. Now the largest aquifer in North America is from Midland  Texas to the South Dakota border  across eight states    big aquifer  Ogallala  Triassic age. There had to have been         wells fracked in Oklahoma  Texas  Kansas in that aquifer. There's no problems. I don't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania. CA  All right  so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon. Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately  that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive  TBP  Solar and wind  Jim and I agreed on that in    seconds. That is  it's going to be a small part  because you can't rely on it. CA  So how does the world get off fossil fuels  TBP  How do we get there  We have so much natural gas  a day will not come where you say   Well let's don't use that anymore.  You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all. And if you look at California  they use       buses. LAMTA have been on natural gas for    years. The Ft. Worth T has been on it for    years. Why  Air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel. Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California on natural gas  It's because of air quality. I know what you're telling me  and I'm not disagreeing with you. How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point  And I say  that is your problem. CA  All right  so it's the bridge fuel. What is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out. If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution  are you ready to invest in those technologies  even if they aren't maximized for profits  they might be maximized for the future health of the planet  TBP  I lost     million on the wind  okay. Yeah  sure  I'm game for it. Because  again  I'm trying to get energy solved for America. And anything American will work for me. CA  Boone  I really  really appreciate you coming here  engaging in this conversation. I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you. And that was a real gift you gave this audience. Thank you so much.  TBP  You bet  Chris. Thank you.  One out of two of you women will be impacted by cardiovascular disease in your lifetime. So this is the leading killer of women. It's a closely held secret for reasons I don't know. In addition to making this personal    so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women's relationship with their heart    we're going to wax into the politics. Because the personal  as you know  is political. And not enough is being done about this. And as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign  this is what we need to do now with heart. Since       more women die in the U.S. than men. So where we used to think of heart disease as being a man's problem primarily    which that was never true  but that was kind of how everybody thought in the     s and '  s  and it was in all the textbooks. It's certainly what I learned when I was training. If we were to remain sexist  and that was not right  but if we were going to go forward and be sexist  it's actually a woman's disease. So it's a woman's disease now. And one of the things that you see is that male line  the mortality is going down  down  down  down  down. And you see the female line since       the gap is widening. More and more women  two  three  four times more women  dying of heart disease than men. And that's too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change. So what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies  which had been developed in men  by men  for men for the last    years    and they work pretty well in men  don't they     weren't working so well for women. So that was a big wake up call in the     's. Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer. And the breast cancer campaign    again  this is not a competition. We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign. We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis. Now sometimes when people see this  I hear this gasp. We can all think of someone  often a young woman  who has been impacted by breast cancer. We often can't think of a young woman who has heart disease. I'm going to tell you why. Heart disease kills people  often very quickly. So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men  half of the time it's sudden cardiac death    no opportunity to say good bye  no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy  no opportunity to help her pick out a wig. Breast cancer  mortality is down to four percent. And that is the    years that women have advocated. Betty Ford  Nancy Reagan stood up and said   I'm a breast cancer survivor   and it was okay to talk about it. And then physicians have gone to bat. We've done the research. We have effective therapies now. Women are living longer than ever. That has to happen in heart disease  and it's time. It's not happening  and it's time. We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women. As Barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies   Yentl   she portrayed a young woman who wanted an education. And she wanted to study the Talmud. And so how did she get educated then  She had to impersonate a man. She had to look like a man. She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had. Bernadine Healy  Dr. Healy  was a cardiologist. And right around that time  in the     's  that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up  up  up  up  up  she wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine and said  the Yentl syndrome. Women are dying of heart disease  two  three  four times more than men. Mortality is not going down  it's going up. And she questioned  she hypothesized  is this a Yentl syndrome  And here's what the story is. Is it because women don't look like men  they don't look like that male pattern heart disease that we've spent the last    years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics  and therefore  they're not recognized for their heart disease. And they're just passed. They don't get treated  they don't get detected  they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines. Doctor Healy then subsequently became the first female director of our National Institutes of Health. And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research in the world. And it funds a lot of my research. It funds research all over the place. It was a very big deal for her to become director. And she started  in the face of a lot of controversy  the Women's Health Initiative. And every woman in the room here has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative. It told us about hormone replacement therapy. It's informed us about osteoporosis. It informed us about breast cancer  colon cancer in women. So a tremendous fund of knowledge despite  again  that so many people told her not to do it  it was too expensive. And the under reading was women aren't worth it. She was like   Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it.  Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative that went to National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute  which is the cardiology part of the NIH. And we got to do the WISE study    and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation    and I have chaired this study for the last    years. It was a study to specifically ask  what's going on with women  Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease  So in the WISE     years ago  we started out and said   Well wow  there's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that.  And our colleagues in Washington  D.C. had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die  compared to men who have heart attacks and die    and again  this is millions of people  happening every day    women  in their fatty plaque    and this is their coronary artery  so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle    women erode  men explode. You're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology. So I'll describe the male pattern heart attack first. Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh. Horrible chest pain. EKG goes pbbrrhh  so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG. There's a big clot in the middle of the artery. And they go up to the cath lab and boom  boom  boom get rid of the clot. That's a man heart attack. Some women have those heart attacks  but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack  where it erodes  doesn't completely fill with clot  symptoms are subtle  EKG findings are different    female pattern. So what do you think happens to these gals  They're often not recognized  sent home. I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas. So we picked up on that and we said   You know  we now have the ability to look inside human beings with these special catheters called IVUS  intravascular ultrasound.  And we said   We're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different  and deposited differently  than men.  And because of the common knowledge of how women and men get fat. When we watch people become obese  where do men get fat  Right here  it's just a focal    right there. Where do women get fat  All over. Cellulite here  cellulite here. So we said   Look  women look like they're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away  smoothly putting it away. Men just have to dump it in a single area.  So we said   Let's look at these.  And so the yellow is the fatty plaque  and panel A is a man. And you can see  it's lumpy bumpy. He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries. Panel B is the woman  very smooth. She's just laid it down nice and tidy. And if you did that angiogram  which is the red  you can see the man's disease. So    years of honing and crafting these angiograms  we easily recognize male pattern disease. Kind of hard to see that female pattern disease. So that was a discovery. Now what are the implications of that  Well once again  women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem. So we are working now on a non invasive    again  these are all invasive studies. Ideally you would love to do all this non invasively. And again     years of good non invasive stress testing  we're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests. So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We're doing this at the Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in the Women's Heart Center. We selected this for the research. This is not in your community hospital  but we would hope to translate this. And we're about two and a half years into a five year study. This was the only modality that can see the inner lining of the heart. And if you look carefully  you can see that there's a black blush right there. And that is microvascular obstruction. The syndrome  the female pattern now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction  or obstruction. The second reason we really liked MRI is that there's no radiation. So unlike the CAT scans  X rays  thalliums  for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart  every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation  we say   Do we really need that test   So we're very excited about M.R. You can't go and order it yet  but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men. What are the downstream consequences then  when female pattern heart disease is not recognized  This is a figure from an editorial that I published in the European Heart Journal this last summer. And it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease  despite these good treatments that we know and we have work. And when the woman has male pattern disease    so she looks like Barbara in the movie    they get treated. And when you have female pattern and you look like a woman  as Barbara does here with her husband  they don't get the treatment. These are our life saving treatments. And those little red boxes are deaths. So those are the consequences. And that is female pattern and why we think the Yentl syndrome actually is explaining a lot of these gaps. There's been wonderful news also about studying women  finally  in heart disease. And one of the the cutting edge areas that we're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy. If you ask  what is the big difference between women and men physiologically  Why are there women and men  Because women bring new life into the world. That's all stem cells. So we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury  doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs  which is one of the things that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy. These are female and male stem cells. And if you had an injured organ  if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area  do you want those robust  plentiful stem cells on the top  Or do you want these guys  that look like they're out to lunch  And some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female stem cells    and this is in animals and increasingly we're showing this in humans    that female stem cells  when put even into a male body  do better than male stem cells going into a male body. One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology    because again  as much as we're talking about women and heart disease  women do  on average  have better longevity than men    is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women. So this is not a zero sum game in anyway. Okay  so here's where we started. And remember  paths crossed in       and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease. What has happened in the last    years with this work  We are bending the curve. We're bending the curve. So just like the breast cancer story  doing research  getting awareness going  it works  you just have to get it going. Now are we happy with this  We still have two to three more women dying for every man. And I would propose  with the better longevity that women have overall  that women probably should theoretically do better  if we could just get treated. So this is where we are  but we have a long row to hoe. We've worked on this for    years. And I've told you  we've been working on male pattern heart disease for    years. So we're    years behind. And we'd like to think it's not going to take    years. And in fact  it probably won't. But we cannot stop now. Too many lives are at stake. So what do we need to do  You now  hopefully  have a more personal relationship with your heart. Women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns. The women are very good about getting mammograms now. And women do fundraising. Women participate. They have put their money where their mouth is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns. This is what we need to do with heart disease now. And it's political. Women's health  from a federal funding standpoint  sometimes it's popular  sometimes it's not so popular. So we have these feast and famine cycles. So I implore you to join the Red Dress Campaign in this fundraising. Breast cancer  as we said  kills women  but heart disease kills a whole bunch more. So if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge  we have a lot of lives to save. So thank you for your attention. So my name is Taylor Wilson. I am    years old and I am a nuclear physicist  which may be a little hard to believe  but I am. And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point  that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to. So nuclear fusion is our energy future. And the second point  making the case that kids can really change the world. So you may ask    You may ask me  well how do you know what our energy future is  Well I built a fusion reactor when I was    years old. That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor. I started building this project when I was about    or    years old. I decided I wanted to make a star. Now most of you are probably saying  well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion. I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy. Well it doesn't break even. It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in  but it still does some pretty cool stuff. And I assembled this in my garage  and it now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada  Reno. And it slams together deuterium  which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it. So this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun. And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together  and in the process it has some byproducts  and I utilize those byproducts. So this previous year  I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has. For hundreds of dollars  I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars. I built this in my garage. And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes. Instead of requiring multi million dollar facilities I've developed a device that  on a very small scale  can produce these isotopes. So that's my fusion reactor in the background there. That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor. Oh  by the way  I make yellowcake in my garage  so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians. So maybe I don't want to admit to that. This is me at CERN in Geneva  Switzerland  which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world. And this is me with President Obama  showing him my Homeland Security research. So in about seven years of doing nuclear research  I started out with a dream to make a  star in a jar   a star in my garage  and I ended up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world  and I think other kids can too. So thank you very much. I'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry. And the way I'm going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my poems. And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about. Because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act. But when I was United States Poet Laureate    and I love saying that. It's a great way to start sentences. When I was him back then  I was approached by J. Walter Thompson  the ad company  and they were hired sort of by the Sundance Channel. And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them. And I was initially resistant  because I always think poetry can stand alone by itself. Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results  in all cases. And the poem  if it's written with the ear  already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed. And surely  if you're reading a poem that mentions a cow  you don't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow. I mean  let's let the reader do a little work. But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility  and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood. I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers  Merrie Melodies and Loony Tunes cartoons. Bugs Bunny is my muse. And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places. And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places    poetry on buses  poetry on subways  on billboards  on cereal boxes. When I was Poet Laureate  there I go again    I can't help it  it's true    I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines that lasted for a couple of years. So you could tune into poetry as you were flying. And my sense is  it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life. Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you. When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever  it happens to you so suddenly that you don't have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school. So let us start with the first one. It's a little poem called  Budapest   and in it I reveal  or pretend to reveal  the secrets of the creative process. My pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater. I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly  intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day. It wants only to be here tomorrow  dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt  nose pressed against the page  writing a few more dutiful lines while I gaze out the window and imagine Budapest or some other city where I have never been. BC  So that makes it seem a little easier. Writing is not actually as easy as that for me. But I like to pretend that it comes with ease. One of my students came up after class  an introductory class  and she said   You know  poetry is harder than writing   which I found both erroneous and profound. So I like to at least pretend it just flows out. A friend of mine has a slogan  he's another poet. He says that   If at first you don't succeed  hide all evidence you ever tried.  The next poem is also rather short. Poetry just says a few things in different ways. And I think you could boil this poem down to saying   Some days you eat the bear  other days the bear eats you.  And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture. Some days I put the people in their places at the table  bend their legs at the knees  if they come with that feature  and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs. All afternoon they face one another  the man in the brown suit  the woman in the blue dress    perfectly motionless  perfectly behaved. But other days I am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table. Very funny. But how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god  your shoulders in the clouds  or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face  BC  There's a horror movie in there somewhere. The next poem is called forgetfulness  and it's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage. And the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia  in other words  forgetting the things that you have read. The name of the author is the first to go  followed obediently by the title  the plot  the heartbreaking conclusion  the entire novel  which suddenly becomes one you have never read  never even heard of. It is as if  one by one  the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones. Long ago  you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag. And even now  as you memorize the order of the planets  something else is slipping away  a state flower perhaps  the address of an uncle  the capital of Paraguay. Whatever it is you are struggling to remember  it is not poised on the tip of your tongue  not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen. It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall  well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle. No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war. No wonder the Moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart. BC  The next poem is called  The Country  and it's based on  when I was in college I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine. He lived  and still does  in rural Vermont. I lived in New York City. And we would visit each other. And when I would go up to the country  he would teach me things like deer hunting  which meant getting lost with a gun basically    and trout fishing and stuff like that. And then he'd come down to New York City and I'd teach him what I knew  which was largely smoking and drinking. And in that way we traded lore with each other. The poem that's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that I had a very hard time  at first  processing. It's called  The Country.  I wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house  because the mice might get into them and start a fire. But your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches  you said  are always stowed. Who could sleep that night  Who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper  gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth  Who could not see him rounding a corner  the blue tip scratching against rough hewn beam  the sudden flare and the creature  for one bright  shining moment  suddenly thrust ahead of his time    now a fire starter  now a torch bearer in a forgotten ritual  little brown druid illuminating some ancient night  And who could fail to notice  lit up in the blazing insulation  the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice    one time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country  BC  Thank you. Thank you. And the last poem is called  The Dead.  I wrote this after a friend's funeral  but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying  as all eulogists tend to do  which is how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled. And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife  having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified. So the little poem is called  The Dead.  The dead are always looking down on us  they say. While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich  they are looking down through the glass bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity. They watch the tops of our heads moving below on Earth. And when we lie down in a field or on a couch  drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon  they think we are looking back at them  which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes. BC  I'm not sure if other poems will be animated. It took a long time    I mean  it's rather uncommon to have this marriage    a long time to put those two together. But then again  it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together. I mean  we had the wheel for some time. And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art. I just have time to read a more recent poem to you. If it has a subject  the subject is adolescence. And it's addressed to a certain person. It's called  To My Favorite    Year Old High School Girl.   Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon on the day you were born  you would be all done in only one more year  Of course  you couldn't have done that all alone. So never mind  you're fine just being yourself. You're loved for just being you. But did you know that at your age Judy Garland was pulling down         dollars a picture  Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room    no wait  I mean he had invented the calculator  Of course  there will be time for all that later in your life  after you come out of your room and begin to blossom  or at least pick up all your socks. For some reason I keep remembering that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England when she was only   . But then she was beheaded  so never mind her as a role model. A few centuries later  when he was your age  Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family  but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies  four operas and two complete masses as a youngster. But of course  that was in Austria at the height of Romantic lyricism  not here in the suburbs of Cleveland. Frankly  who cares if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at    or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at     We think you're special just being you    playing with your food and staring into space. By the way  I lied about Schubert doing the dishes  but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house.  Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Look  I had second thoughts  really  about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys. Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem  which goes   The truth will set you free  but first it will piss you off.   Laughter  So     Laughter  So with that in mind  I'm going to set about trying to do those things here  and talk about dying in the   st century. Now the first thing that will piss you off  undoubtedly  is that all of us are  in fact  going to die in the   st century. There will be no exceptions to that. There are  apparently  about one in eight of you who think you're immortal  on surveys  but    Unfortunately  that isn't going to happen. While I give this talk  in the next    minutes  a hundred million of my cells will die  and over the course of today        of my brain cells will die and never come back  so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece. Anyway  the second thing I want to say about dying in the   st century  apart from it's going to happen to everybody  is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us  unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on. So there you go. That's the truth. No doubt that will piss you off  and now let's see whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything. Now  as you heard in the intro  I work in intensive care  and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday of intensive care. It's been a ride  man. This has been fantastic. We have machines that go ping. There's many of them up there. And we have some wizard technology which I think has worked really well  and over the course of the time I've worked in intensive care  the death rate for males in Australia has halved  and intensive care has had something to do with that. Certainly  a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that. So we have had tremendous success  and we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit  and we started using expressions like  lifesaving.  I really apologize to everybody for doing that  because obviously  we don't. What we do is prolong people's lives  and delay death  and redirect death  but we can't  strictly speaking  save lives on any sort of permanent basis. And what's really happened over the period of time that I've been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the '  s  '  s  and '  s  are now coming to die in the   st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then. So what's happening now is there's been a big shift in the way that people die  and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when I was doing this in the '  s and '  s. So we kind of got a bit caught up with this  and we haven't really squared with you guys about what's really happening now  and it's about time we did. I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '  s when I met this guy. This guy is called Jim  Jim Smith  and he looked like this. I was called down to the ward to see him. His is the little hand. I was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician. He said   Look  there's a guy down here. He's got pneumonia  and he looks like he needs intensive care. His daughter's here and she wants everything possible to be done.  Which is a familiar phrase to us. So I go down to the ward and see Jim  and his skin his translucent like this. You can see his bones through the skin. He's very  very thin  and he is  indeed  very sick with pneumonia  and he's too sick to talk to me  so I talk to his daughter Kathleen  and I say to her   Did you and Jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation   And she looked at me and said   No  of course not   I thought   Okay. Take this steady.  And I got talking to her  and after a while  she said to me   You know  we always thought there'd be time.  Jim was   .  Laughter  And I realized that something wasn't happening here. There wasn't this dialogue going on that I imagined was happening. So a group of us started doing survey work  and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in Newcastle  in the Newcastle area  and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating. One in a hundred. And only one in     of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill. And I realized  of course  this dialogue is definitely not occurring in the public at large. Now  I work in acute care. This is John Hunter Hospital. And I thought  surely  we do better than that. So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die. And we didn't find a single record of any preference about goals  treatments or outcomes from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient. So we started to realize that we had a problem  and the problem is more serious because of this. What we know is that obviously we are all going to die  but how we die is actually really important  obviously not just to us  but also to how that features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards. How we die lives on in the minds of everybody who survives us  and the stress created in families by dying is enormous  and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else  so dying in intensive care is not your top option if you've got a choice. And  if that wasn't bad enough  of course  all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you  in fact  about one in    of you at this point  will die in intensive care. In the U.S.  it's one in five. In Miami  it's three out of five people die in intensive care. So this is the sort of momentum that we've got at the moment. The reason why this is all happening is due to this  and I do have to take you through what this is about. These are the four ways to go. So one of these will happen to all of us. The ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical interest  sudden death. It's quite likely in an audience this size this won't happen to anybody here. Sudden death has become very rare. The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn't happen anymore. The dying process of those with terminal illness that we've just seen occurs to younger people. By the time you've reached     this is unlikely to happen to you. Only one in    people who are over    will die of cancer. The big growth industry are these. What you die of is increasing organ failure  with your respiratory  cardiac  renal  whatever organs packing up. Each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital  at the end of which  or at some point during which  somebody says  enough is enough  and we stop. And this one's the biggest growth industry of all  and at least six out of    of the people in this room will die in this form  which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty  and frailty's an inevitable part of aging  and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now  and the last few years  or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability  unfortunately. Enjoying it so far   Laughs  Sorry  I just feel such a  I feel such a Cassandra here. What can I say that's positive  What's positive is that this is happening at very great age  now. We are all  most of us  living to reach this point. You know  historically  we didn't do that. This is what happens to you when you live to be a great age  and unfortunately  increasing longevity does mean more old age  not more youth. I'm sorry to say that.  Laughter  What we did  anyway  look  what we did  we didn't just take this lying down at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere. We've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could  in fact  involve people much more in the way that things happen to them. But we realized  of course  that we are dealing with cultural issues  and this is  I love this Klimt painting  because the more you look at it  the more you kind of get the whole issue that's going on here  which is clearly the separation of death from the living  and the fear   Like  if you actually look  there's one woman there who has her eyes open. She's the one he's looking at  and  she's  the one he's coming for. Can you see that  She looks terrified. It's an amazing picture. Anyway  we had a major cultural issue. Clearly  people didn't want us to talk about death  or  we thought that. So with loads of funding from the Federal Government and the local Health Service  we introduced a thing at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices. We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die  and what would they prefer under those circumstances. They loved it. The families and the patients  they loved it. Ninety eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice  and that this is how things should work. And when they expressed wishes  all of those wishes came true  as it were. We were able to make that happen for them. But then  when the funding ran out  we went back to look six months later  and everybody had stopped again  and nobody was having these conversations anymore. So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us  because we thought this was going to really take off. The cultural issue had reasserted itself. So here's the pitch  I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not that's where we all want to end up  particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and ICU has less and less and less to offer us. There has to be a little side road off there for people who don't want to go on that track. And I have one small idea  and one big idea about what could happen. And this is the small idea. The small idea is  let's all of us engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated. Why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this  There are a couple of things you can do. One of them is  you can  just ask this simple question. This question never fails.  In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself  who would you like to speak for you   That's a really important question to ask people  because giving people the control over who that is produces an amazing outcome. The second thing you can say is   Have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do   So that's the little idea. The big idea  I think  is more political. I think we have to get onto this. I suggested we should have Occupy Death. My wife said   Yeah  right  sit ins in the mortuary. Yeah  yeah. Sure.   Laughter  So that one didn't really run  but I was very struck by this. Now  I'm an aging hippie. I don't know  I don't think I look like that anymore  but I had  two of my kids were born at home in the '  s when home birth was a big thing  and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation  so if you just replace all these words of birth  I like  Peace  Love  Natural Death  as an option. I do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which it's going. Now  listen  that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia. I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all  I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow. I don't think euthanasia matters. I actually think that  in places like Oregon  where you can have physician assisted suicide  you take a poisonous dose of stuff  only half a percent of people ever do that. I'm more interested in what happens to the   .  percent of people who don't want to do that. I think most people don't want to be dead  but I do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds. So I'm an opponent of euthanasia  but I do think we have to give people back some control. It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply. I think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia  not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all. This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders  whom I met when I was a medical student. She founded the hospice movement. And she said   You matter because you are  and you matter to the last moment of your life.  And I firmly believe that that's the message that we have to carry forward. Thank you.  Applause  The electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago. Because the way things stand today  electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply. If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage  some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid  the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. But coal plants  nuclear plants can't respond fast enough. A giant battery could. With a giant battery  we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal  gas and nuclear do today. You see  the battery is the key enabling device here. With it  we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn't shine. And that changes everything. Because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings  here to center stage. Today I want to tell you about such a device. It's called the liquid metal battery. It's a new form of energy storage that I invented at MIT along with a team of my students and post docs. Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum. The OED defines spectrum as  The entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation  from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part.  So I'm not here today only to tell you how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world's great problems. I want to go full spectrum and tell you how  in the process of developing this new technology  we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as lessons for innovation  ideas worth spreading. And you know  if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation  we can't just conserve our way out  we can't just drill our way out  we can't bomb our way out. We're going to do it the old fashioned American way  we're going to invent our way out  working together. Now let's get started. The battery was invented about     years ago by a professor  Alessandro Volta  at the University of Padua in Italy. His invention gave birth to a new field of science  electrochemistry  and new technologies such as electroplating. Perhaps overlooked  Volta's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor. Until Volta  nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use. Here's the first battery    a stack of coins  zinc and silver  separated by cardboard soaked in brine. This is the starting point for designing a battery    two electrodes  in this case metals of different composition  and an electrolyte  in this case salt dissolved in water. The science is that simple. Admittedly  I've left out a few details. Now I've taught you that battery science is straightforward and the need for grid level storage is compelling  but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the demanding performance requirements of the grid    namely uncommonly high power  long service lifetime and super low cost. We need to think about the problem differently. We need to think big  we need to think cheap. So let's abandon the paradigm of let's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product. Instead  let's invent to the price point of the electricity market. So that means that certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically off limits. This battery needs to be made out of earth abundant elements. I say  if you want to make something dirt cheap  make it out of dirt    preferably dirt that's locally sourced. And we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don't cost us a fortune. So about six years ago  I started thinking about this problem. And in order to adopt a fresh perspective  I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage. In fact  I looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity  but instead consumes electricity  huge amounts of it. I'm talking about the production of aluminum. The process was invented in      by a couple of    year olds    Hall in the United States and Heroult in France. And just a few short years following their discovery  aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material. You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter. It's about    feet wide and recedes about half a mile    row after row of cells that  inside  resemble Volta's battery  with three important differences. Volta's battery works at room temperature. It's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water. The Hall Heroult cell operates at high temperature  a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid. The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water  but rather salt that's melted. It's this combination of liquid metal  molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing. Today  we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than    cents a pound. That's the economic miracle of modern electrometallurgy. It is this that caught and held my attention to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale. And I did. I made the battery all liquid    liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte. I'll show you how. So I put low density liquid metal at the top  put a high density liquid metal at the bottom  and molten salt in between. So now  how to choose the metals  For me  the design exercise always begins here with the periodic table  enunciated by another professor  Dimitri Mendeleyev. Everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here. And that includes our own bodies. I recall the very moment one day when I was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance  different  opposite density and high mutual reactivity. I felt the thrill of realization when I knew I'd come upon the answer. Magnesium for the top layer. And antimony for the bottom layer. You know  I've got to tell you  one of the greatest benefits of being a professor  colored chalk. So to produce current  magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion  which then migrates across the electrolyte  accepts two electrons from the antimony  and then mixes with it to form an alloy. The electrons go to work in the real world out here  powering our devices. Now to charge the battery  we connect a source of electricity. It could be something like a wind farm. And then we reverse the current. And this forces magnesium to de alloy and return to the upper electrode  restoring the initial constitution of the battery. And the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature. It's pretty cool  at least in theory. But does it really work  So what to do next  We go to the laboratory. Now do I hire seasoned professionals  No  I hire a student and mentor him  teach him how to think about the problem  to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose. This is that student  David Bradwell  who  in this image  appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work. What I didn't tell David at the time was I myself wasn't convinced it would work. But David's young and he's smart and he wants a Ph.D.  and he proceeds to build    He proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry. And based on David's initial promising results  which were paid with seed funds at MIT  I was able to attract major research funding from the private sector and the federal government. And that allowed me to expand my group to    people  a mix of graduate students  post docs and even some undergraduates. And I was able to attract really  really good people  people who share my passion for science and service to society  not science and service for career building. And if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery  their answer would hearken back to President Kennedy's remarks at Rice University in      when he said    and I'm taking liberties here     We choose to work on grid level storage  not because it is easy  but because it is hard.  So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery. We start here with our workhorse one watt hour cell. I called it the shotglass. We've operated over     of these  perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries    not just magnesium and antimony. Along the way we scaled up to the    watt hour cell. I call it the hockey puck. And we got the same remarkable results. And then it was onto the saucer. That's     watt hours. The technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable. But the pace wasn't fast enough for us. So a year and a half ago  David and I  along with another research staff member  formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress and the race to manufacture product. So today at LMBC  we're building cells    inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt hour          times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell. We call that the pizza. And then we've got a four kilowatt hour cell on the horizon. It's going to be    inches in diameter. We call that the bistro table  but it's not ready yet for prime time viewing. And one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules  aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a    foot shipping container for placement in the field. And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt hours    two million watt hours. That's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of     American households. So here you have it  grid level storage  silent  emissions free  no moving parts  remotely controlled  designed to the market price point without subsidy. So what have we learned from all this  So what have we learned from all this  Let me share with you some of the surprises  the heterodoxies. They lie beyond the visible. Temperature  Conventional wisdom says set it low  at or near room temperature  and then install a control system to keep it there. Avoid thermal runaway. Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation. Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges. Scaling  Conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many. Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer  but they'll be larger. And finally  human resources  Conventional wisdom says hire battery experts  seasoned professionals  who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge. To develop liquid metal battery  I hired students and post docs and mentored them. In a battery  I strive to maximize electrical potential  when mentoring  I strive to maximize human potential. So you see  the liquid metal battery story is more than an account of inventing technology  it's a blueprint for inventing inventors  full spectrum. You should be nice to nerds. In fact  I'd go so far as to say  if you don't already have a nerd in your life  you should get one. I'm just saying. Scientists and engineers change the world. I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure. Now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize  because when you remove the fear of failure  impossible things suddenly become possible. If you want to know how  ask yourself this question  What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail  If you really ask yourself this question  you can't help but feel uncomfortable. I feel a little uncomfortable. Because when you ask it  you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you  how it keeps us from attempting great things  and life gets dull  amazing things stop happening. Sure  good things happen  but amazing things stop happening. Now I should be clear  I'm not encouraging failure  I'm discouraging fear of failure. Because it's not failure itself that constrains us. The path to truly new  never been done before things always has failure along the way. We're tested. And in part  that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great. Clemenceau said   Life gets interesting when we fail  because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves.  In       Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible. In October of       the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in    million years we could build an aircraft that would fly. And two months later on December   th  Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina. The flight lasted    seconds and covered     feet. That was     . One year later  the next declarations of impossibilities began. Ferdinand Foch  a French army general credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army  said   Airplanes are interesting toys  but of no military value.     years later  aero experts coined the term transonic. They debated  should it have one S or two  You see  they were having trouble in this flight regime  and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound. In       there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach  .  . And yet  on Tuesday  October   th        Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X   and he flew towards an unknown possibility  and in so doing  he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound. Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad. After    complete mission failures  we got our first images from space. And on that first flight we got more data than in all U   missions combined. It took a lot of failures to get there. Since we took to the sky  we have wanted to fly faster and farther. And to do so  we've had to believe in impossible things. And we've had to refuse to fear failure. That's still true today. Today  we don't talk about flying transonically  or even supersonically  we talk about flying hypersonically    not Mach   or Mach    Mach   . At Mach     we can fly from New York to Long Beach in    minutes and    seconds. At that speed  the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel          degrees Fahrenheit    like a blast furnace. We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it. And we are flying it  or trying to. DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built. It's boosted to near space atop a Minotaur IV rocket. Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse  so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an    degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory. That's an unnatural act for a rocket. The third stage has a camera. We call it rocketcam. And it's pointed at the hypersonic glider. This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight one. Now to conceal the shape  we changed the aspect ratio a little bit. But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth. We've flown twice. In the first flight  no aerodynamic control of the vehicle. But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in    years of ground based testing combined. And in the second flight  three minutes of fully controlled  aerodynamic flight at Mach   . We must fly again  because amazing  never been done before things require that you fly. You can't learn to fly at Mach    unless you fly. And while there's no substitute for speed  maneuverability is a very close second. If a Mach    glider takes    minutes and    seconds to get from New York to Long Beach  a hummingbird would take  well  days. You see  hummingbirds are not hypersonic  but they are maneuverable. In fact  the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards. It can fly up  down  forwards  backwards  even upside down. And so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can't go  we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so. This is a hummingbird drone. It can fly in all directions  even backwards. It can hover and rotate. This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera. It weighs less than one AA battery. It does not eat nectar. In       it flew for a whopping    seconds  a year later  two minutes  then six  eventually   . Many prototypes crashed    many. But there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly. It's beautiful  isn't it. Wow. It's great. Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot. Failure is part of creating new and amazing things. We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things    like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain  or maybe even ice  a robot that can run like a cheetah  or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human. Or perhaps  Spider Man will one day be Gecko Man. A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe. One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad has        hair like structures called setae. They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces. Today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot. The result  a four by four inch artificial nano gecko adhesive. can support a static load of     pounds. That's enough to stick six    inch plasma TV's to your wall  no nails. So much for Velcro  right  And it's not just passive structures  it's entire machines. This is a spider mite. It's one millimeter long  but it looks like Godzilla next to these micromachines. In the world of Godzilla spider mites  we can make millions of mirrors  each one fifth the diameter of a human hair  moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second to make large screen displays  so that we can watch movies like  Godzilla  in high def. And if we can build machines at that scale  what about Eiffel Tower like trusses at the microscale  Today we are making metals that are lighter than Styrofoam  so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air    so light that you can make a car that two people can lift  but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV. From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms. There are    lightning strikes per second around the globe. Each lightning bolt heats the air to        degrees Fahrenheit    hotter than the surface of the Sun. What if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons  beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters  Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS. Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains. Using a grid the size of your thumb  with    electrodes on the surface of his brain  Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm. And his thoughts made him reach for Katie. This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone. And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years. That moment mattered to Tim and Katie  and this green goo may someday matter to you. This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life. It was made in tobacco plants. Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months  and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever. And if it seems far fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy  what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve  Last September  the gamers of Foldit solved the three dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys. Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments. For    years  it was unsolved in the scientific community. The gamers of Foldit solved it in    days. Now they were able to do so by working together. They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet. And others  also connected to the Internet  used it as an instrument of democracy. And together they changed the fate of their nation. The Internet is home to two billion people  or    percent of the world's population. It allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals. It allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group. But it too had humble beginnings. In       the internet was but a dream  a few sketches on a piece of paper. And then on October   th  the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI. The first two letters of the word  Login   that's all that made it through    an L and an O    and then a buffer overflow crashed the system. Two letters  an L and an O  now a worldwide force. So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA  They are nerds  and they are heroes among us. They challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions. They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure. They remind us that we all have nerd power. Sometimes we just forget. You see  there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure  when you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing  you were good at math  you could build things  you were an astronaut  an adventurer  Jacques Cousteau  you could jump higher  run faster  kick harder than anyone. You believed in impossible things and you were fearless. You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero. Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world. So can you. You were born to. So go ahead  ask yourself  what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail  Now I want to say  this is not easy. It's hard to hold onto this feeling  really hard. I guess in some way  I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard. Doubt and fear always creep in. We think someone else  someone smarter than us  someone more capable  someone with more resources will solve that problem. But there isn't anyone else  there's just you. And if we're lucky  in that moment  someone steps into that doubt and fear  takes a hand and says   Let me help you believe.  Jason Harley did that for me. Jason started at DARPA on March   th      . He was with our transportation team. I saw Jason nearly every day  sometimes twice a day. And more so than most  he saw the highs and the lows  the celebrations and the disappointments. And on one particularly dark day for me  Jason sat down and he wrote an email. He was encouraging  but firm. And when he hit send  he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make. It mattered to me. In that moment and still today when I doubt  when I feel afraid  when I need to reconnect with that feeling  I remember his words  they were so powerful. Text   There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you.    Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.     Superhero  superhero.   Voice  Because that's what being a superhero is all about. RD   There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you.  And remember  be nice to nerds. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Regina  thank you. I have a couple of questions. So that glider of yours  the Mach    glider  the first one  no control  it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere. RD  Yeah  yeah. It did.  CA  What happened on that second flight   Yeah  it also went into the Pacific.  CA  But this time under control   We didn't fly it into the Pacific. No  there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed. And so in the second flight  we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it. CA  I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach anytime soon. RD  It might be a little warm. CA  What do you picture that glider being used for  RD  Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this. How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military. Now the purpose of the vehicle though  the purpose of the technology  is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than    minutes. CA  And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds   RD  Yeah.  Like what's the payload it could carry  RD  Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be  right. We've got to fly it first. CA  But not necessarily just a camera  RD  No  not necessarily just a camera. CA  It's amazing. The hummingbird  RD  Yeah  CA  I'm curious  you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings and failing horribly  and there haven't been that many planes built since that flap wings. Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird  Isn't that a very expensive solution for a small maneuverable flying object  RD  So I mean  in part  we wondered if it was possible to do it. And you have to revisit these questions over time. The folks at AeroVironment tried     or more different wing designs     different forms of the avionics. It took them    full prototypes to get something that would actually fly. But there's something really interesting about a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize. So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing  but when things looks just natural  you also don't see them. CA  Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance. It's partly the look.  RD  Sure.  It's actually   Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters.  Because I think  as well as the awe of looking at that  I'm sure some people here are thinking  technology catches up so quick  how long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies one through a window of the White House  I mean  do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here  RD  Well look  our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise. That's what we do. It would be inconceivable for us to do that work if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time. It's just the nature of what we do. Now our responsibility is to push that edge. And we have to be  of course  mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used  but we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing  it's advancing. CA  I mean  you're clearly a really inspiring leader. And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention  but at a personal level  in a way I can't imagine doing your job. Do you wake up in the night sometimes  just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team's brilliance  RD  Sure. I think you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions. CA  How do you answer them  RD  Well I don't always have answers for them  right. I think that we learn as time goes on. My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have. I work with some of the most amazing people. And with that exhilaration  comes a really deep sense of responsibility. And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible and this tremendous seriousness of what it means. CA  Regina  that was jaw dropping  as they say. Thank you so much for coming to TED.  RD  Thank you.  Many times I go around the world to speak  and people ask me questions about the challenges  my moments  some of my regrets.       A single mother of four  three months after the birth of my fourth child  I went to do a job as a research assistant. I went to Northern Liberia. And as part of the work  the village would give you lodgings. And they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter. This girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade. She was the laughing stock of the community. Her mother was often told by other women   You and your child will die poor.  After two weeks of working in that village  it was time to go back. The mother came to me  knelt down  and said   Leymah  take my daughter. I wish for her to be a nurse.  Dirt poor  living in the home with my parents  I couldn't afford to. With tears in my eyes  I said   No.  Two months later  I go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief. The women's chief of the village has this little girl  fair color like me  totally dirty. And all day she walked around only in her underwear. When I asked   Who is that   She said   That's Wei. The meaning of her name is pig. Her mother died while giving birth to her  and no one had any idea who her father was.  For two weeks  she became my companion  slept with me. I bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll. The night before I left  she came to the room and said   Leymah  don't leave me here. I wish to go with you. I wish to go to school.  Dirt poor  no money  living with my parents  I again said   No.  Two months later  both of those villages fell into another war. Till today  I have no idea where those two girls are. Fast forward        In the peak of our activism  the minister of Gender Liberia called me and said   Leymah  I have a nine year old for you. I want you to bring her home because we don't have safe homes.  The story of this little girl  She had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months. She came to me bloated  very pale. Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor. She'd lie beside me and say   Auntie  I wish to be well. I wish to go to school.        A young woman stands before President Sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together  their father and mother died during the war. She's     her dream is to go to college to be able to support them. She's highly athletic. One of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship. Full scholarship. She gets it. Her dream of going to school  her wish of being educated  is finally here. She goes to school on the first day. The director of sports who's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class. And for the next three years  her fate will be having sex with him every day  as a favor for getting her in school. Globally  we have policies  international instruments  work leaders. Great people have made commitments    we will protect our children from want and from fear. The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Countries like America  we've heard things like No Child Left Behind. Other countries come with different things. There is a Millennium Development called Three that focuses on girls. All of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally  I think  has failed. In Liberia  for example  the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every    girls. Teen prostitution is at its peak. In one community  we're told  you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper. Girls as young as    being prostituted for less than a dollar a night. It's disheartening  it's sad. And then someone asked me  just before my TEDTalk  a few days ago   So where is the hope   Several years ago  a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women. It's not enough to say you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia when your girls' kids are totally out there and no hope  or seemingly no hope. We created a space called the Young Girls Transformative Project. We go into rural communities and all we do  like has been done in this room  is create the space. When these girls sit  you unlock intelligence  you unlock passion  you unlock commitment  you unlock focus  you unlock great leaders. Today  we've worked with over    . And some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps  as young mothers  to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women. One young woman I met  teen mother of four  never thought about finishing high school  graduated successfully  never thought about going to college  enrolled in college. One day she said to me   My wish is to finish college and be able to support my children.  She's at a place where she can't find money to go to school. She sells water  sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones. And you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education. Juanita is her name. She takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school. Says   Leymah  my wish is to be educated. And if I can't be educated  when I see some of my sisters being educated  my wish has been fulfilled. I wish for a better life. I wish for food for my children. I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop.  This is the dream of the African girl. Several years ago  there was one African girl. This girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry. Angry  frustrated  really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children  this young girl started a movement  a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace. I will fulfill the wish. This is another African girl's wish. I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls. I failed to do this. These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman    I failed  I failed  I failed. So I will do this. Women came out  protested a brutal dictator  fearlessly spoke. Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true  the wish of peace came true. This young woman wished also to go to school. She went to school. This young woman wished for other things to happen  it happened for her. Today  this young woman is me  a Nobel laureate. I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish  in my tiny capacity  of little African girls    the wish of being educated. We set up a foundation. We're giving full four year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential. I don't have much to ask of you. I've also been to places in this U.S.  and I know that girls in this country also have wishes  a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx  a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown L.A.  a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas  a wish for a better life somewhere in New York  a wish for a better life somewhere in New Jersey. Will you journey with me to help that girl  be it an African girl or an American girl or a Japanese girl  fulfill her wish  fulfill her dream  achieve that dream  Because all of these great innovators and inventors that we've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world  and all they're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence  unlock the passion  unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves. Let's journey together. Let's journey together. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much. Right now in Liberia  what do you see as the main issue that troubles you  LG  I've been asked to lead the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative. As part of my work  I'm doing these tours in different villages and towns           hours on dirt roads    and there is no community that I've gone into that I haven't seen intelligent girls. But sadly  the vision of a great future  or the dream of a great future  is just a dream  because you have all of these vices. Teen pregnancy  like I said  is epidemic. So what troubles me is that I was at that place and somehow I'm at this place  and I just don't want to be the only one at this place. I'm looking for ways for other girls to be with me. I want to look back    years from now and see that there's another Liberian girl  Ghanaian girl  Nigerian girl  Ethiopian girl standing on this TED stage. And maybe  just maybe  saying   Because of that Nobel laureate I'm here today.  So I'm troubled when I see them like there's no hope. But I'm also not pessimistic  because I know it doesn't take a lot to get them charged up. CA  And in the last year  tell us one hopeful thing that you've seen happening. LG  I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening. But in the last year  where President Sirleaf comes from  her village  we went there to work with these girls. And we could not find    girls in high school. All of these girls went to the gold mine  and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things. We took    of those girls and we worked with them. And this was at the beginning of elections. This is one place where women were never    even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men. These girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration. This is a real rural village. And the theme they used was   Even pretty girls vote.  They were able to mobilize young women. But not only did they do that  they went to those who were running for seats to ask them   What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win   And one of the guys who already had a seat was very    because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws  and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric. Rape is not barbaric  but the law  he said  was barbaric. And when the girls started engaging him  he was very hostile towards them. These little girls turned to him and said   We will vote you out of office.  He's out of office today. CA  Leymah  thank you. Thank you so much for coming to TED. LG  You're welcome.  CA  Thank you.  This may sound strange  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block. The first concrete blocks were manufactured in      with a very simple idea  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together. Very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world. They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us  buildings  bridges  one brick at a time. Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time. Almost a hundred years later in       LEGO came up with this. It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. And in a few short years  LEGO bricks took place in every household. It's estimated that over     billion bricks have been produced    or    bricks for every person on the planet. You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses  beautiful bridges  beautiful buildings. LEGO made it accessible. LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block  the building block of the world  and made it into the building block of our imagination. Meanwhile the exact same year  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced  the next building block. The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive. Like the concrete block  the transistor allows you to build much larger  more complex circuits  one brick at a time. But there's a main difference  The transistor was only for experts. I personally don't accept this  that the building block of our time is reserved for experts  so I decided to change that. Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab  I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers. A few years ago I started developing littleBits. Let me show you how they work. LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function. They're pre engineered to be light  sound  motors and sensors. And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets. So you can't put them the wrong way. The bricks are color coded. Green is output  blue is power  pink is input and orange is wire. So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. You put a blue to a green  you can make light. You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer. Switch out the knob for a pulse module  which is here  and now you've made a little blinker. Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine. I'm going to stop that. So beyond simple play  littleBits are actually pretty powerful. Instead of having to program  to wire  to solder  littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures. So to make this blink faster or slower  you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower. The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library. We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready to use brick. Lights  sounds  solar panels  motors    everything should be accessible. We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. And it's been an incredible experience. The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools. For example  how a nightlight works  or why an elevator door stays open  or how an iPod responds to touch. We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. So for example  we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material. Here you see  with felt and paper water bottles  we have Geordie making ... A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever    just cardboard  wood and paper    and told them  Make something.  Here's an example of a project they made  a motion activated confetti canon ball. But wait  this is actually my favorite project. It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark. To these non engineers  littleBits became another material  electronics became just another material. And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. So littleBits is open source. You can go on the website  download all the design files  make them yourself. We want to encourage a world of creators  of inventors  of contributors  because this world that we live in  this interactive world  is ours. So go ahead and start inventing. Thank you. Marco Tempest  What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment. Today's its debut. It's a demonstration of augmented reality. And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded. They are live and reacting to me in real time. I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic. So fingers crossed. And keep your eyes on the big screen. Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer generated imagery. It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask  why  in a technological age  we continue to have this magical sense of wonder. Magic is deception  but it is a deception we enjoy. To enjoy being deceived  an audience must first suspend its disbelief. It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind. Samuel Taylor Coleridge  I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that  for a moment  constitutes poetic faith. MT  This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience. Without it  a script is just words. Augmented reality is just the latest technology. And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity. We are all very good at suspending our disbelief. We do it every day  while reading novels  watching television or going to the movies. We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had. Without this ability there is no magic. It was Jean Robert Houdin  France's greatest illusionist  who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller. He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio. Jean Robert Houdin  A conjurer is not a juggler. He is an actor playing the part of a magician. MT  Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story. The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction. There are tales of creation and loss  death and resurrection  and obstacles that must be overcome. Now many of them are intensely dramatic. Magicians play with fire and steel  defy the fury of the buzzsaw  dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape. But audiences don't come to see the magician die  they come to see him live. Because the best stories always have a happy ending. The tricks of magic have one special element. They are stories with a twist. Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines. He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think. Edward de Bono  Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error. The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable  but do not  in fact  match what is being done in front of them. MT  In that respect  magic tricks are like jokes. Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination. But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected  we laugh. The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks. The finale defies logic  gives new insight into the problem  and audiences express their amazement with laughter. It's fun to be fooled. One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared. We feel compelled to tell them. When I do a trick at a party    that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again. They want to share the experience. That makes my job more difficult  because  if I want to surprise them  I need to tell a story that starts the same  but ends differently    a trick with a twist on a twist. It keeps me busy. Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained. We think in narrative structures. We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood. It's a uniquely human achievement. We all want to share our stories  whether it is the trick we saw at the party  the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation. Today  thanks to technology  we can share those stories as never before  by email  Facebook  blogs  tweets  on TED.com. The tools of social networking  these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story. We turn facts into similes and metaphors  and even fantasies. We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole. Our stories make us the people we are and  sometimes  the people we want to be. They give us our identity and a sense of community. And if the story is a good one  it might even make us smile. Thank you. Thank you. Just a moment ago  my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck. Her text said   Mom  you will rock.  I love this. Getting that text was like getting a hug. And so there you have it. I embody the central paradox. I'm a woman who loves getting texts who's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem. Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story.       when I gave my first TEDTalk  Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row. I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine. In those heady days  we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities. We were exploring different aspects of ourselves. And then we unplugged. I was excited. And  as a psychologist  what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves  about our identity  to live better lives in the real world. Now fast forward to     . I'm back here on the TED stage again. My daughter's   . She's a college student. She sleeps with her cellphone  so do I. And I've just written a new book  but this time it's not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine. So what happened  I'm still excited by technology  but I believe  and I'm here to make the case  that we're letting it take us places that we don't want to go. Over the past    years  I've studied technologies of mobile communication and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people  young and old  about their plugged in lives. And what I've found is that our little devices  those little devices in our pockets  are so psychologically powerful that they don't only change what we do  they change who we are. Some of the things we do now with our devices are things that  only a few years ago  we would have found odd or disturbing  but they've quickly come to seem familiar  just how we do things. So just to take some quick examples  People text or do email during corporate board meetings. They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes  during presentations  actually during all meetings. People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you're texting. People explain to me that it's hard  but that it can be done. Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents' full attention. But then these same children deny each other their full attention. This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together. And we even text at funerals. I study this. We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones. Why does this matter  It matters to me because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble    trouble certainly in how we relate to each other  but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self reflection. We're getting used to a new way of being alone together. People want to be with each other  but also elsewhere    connected to all the different places they want to be. People want to customize their lives. They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention. So you want to go to that board meeting  but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you. And some people think that's a good thing. But you can end up hiding from each other  even as we're all constantly connected to each other. A    year old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work. When he goes to work  he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody  he doesn't call. And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues because  he says   They're too busy on their email.  But then he stops himself and he says   You know  I'm not telling you the truth. I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted. I think I should want to  but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry.  Across the generations  I see that people can't get enough of each other  if and only if they can have each other at a distance  in amounts they can control. I call it the Goldilocks effect  not too close  not too far  just right. But what might feel just right for that middle aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face to face relationships. An    year old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully   Someday  someday  but certainly not now  I'd like to learn how to have a conversation.  When I ask people  What's wrong with having a conversation   People say   I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation. It takes place in real time and you can't control what you're going to say.  So that's the bottom line. Texting  email  posting  all of these things let us present the self as we want to be. We get to edit  and that means we get to delete  and that means we get to retouch  the face  the voice  the flesh  the body    not too little  not too much  just right. Human relationships are rich and they're messy and they're demanding. And we clean them up with technology. And when we do  one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection. We short change ourselves. And over time  we seem to forget this  or we seem to stop caring. I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question  a profound question. He said   Don't all those little tweets  don't all those little sips of online communication  add up to one big gulp of real conversation   My answer was no  they don't add up. Connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information  they may work for saying   I'm thinking about you   or even for saying   I love you      I mean  look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter    but they don't really work for learning about each other  for really coming to know and understand each other. And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves. So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self reflection. For kids growing up  that skill is the bedrock of development. Over and over I hear   I would rather text than talk.  And what I'm seeing is that people get so used to being short changed out of real conversation  so used to getting by with less  that they've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether. So for example  many people share with me this wish  that some day a more advanced version of Siri  the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone  will be more like a best friend  someone who will listen when others won't. I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I've learned in the past    years. That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology. That's why it's so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed    so many automatic listeners. And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us. We're developing robots  they call them sociable robots  that are specifically designed to be companions    to the elderly  to our children  to us. Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other  During my research I worked in nursing homes  and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood. And one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal. It seemed to be looking in her eyes. It seemed to be following the conversation. It comforted her. And many people found this amazing. But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life. That robot put on a great show. And we're vulnerable. People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing. So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy  I was thinking   That robot can't empathize. It doesn't face death. It doesn't know life.  And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion  I didn't find it amazing  I found it one of the most wrenching  complicated moments in my    years of work. But when I stepped back  I felt myself at the cold  hard center of a perfect storm. We expect more from technology and less from each other. And I ask myself   Why have things come to this   And I believe it's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable. And we are vulnerable. We're lonely  but we're afraid of intimacy. And so from social networks to sociable robots  we're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control. But we're not so comfortable. We are not so much in control. These days  those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies. One  that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be  two  that we will always be heard  and three  that we will never have to be alone. And that third idea  that we will never have to be alone  is central to changing our psyches. Because the moment that people are alone  even for a few seconds  they become anxious  they panic  they fidget  they reach for a device. Just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light. Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved. And so people try to solve it by connecting. But here  connection is more like a symptom than a cure. It expresses  but it doesn't solve  an underlying problem. But more than a symptom  constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves. It's shaping a new way of being. The best way to describe it is  I share therefore I am. We use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we're having them. So before it was  I have a feeling  I want to make a call. Now it's  I want to have a feeling  I need to send a text. The problem with this new regime of  I share therefore I am  is that  if we don't have connection  we don't feel like ourselves. We almost don't feel ourselves. So what do we do  We connect more and more. But in the process  we set ourselves up to be isolated. How do you get from connection to isolation  You end up isolated if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude  the ability to be separate  to gather yourself. Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments. When we don't have the capacity for solitude  we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive. When this happens  we're not able to appreciate who they are. It's as though we're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self. We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone. But we're at risk  because actually it's the opposite that's true. If we're not able to be alone  we're going to be more lonely. And if we don't teach our children to be alone  they're only going to know how to be lonely. When I spoke at TED in       reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities  I said   Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self reflection.  And that's what I'm calling for here  now  reflection and  more than that  a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us  what it might be costing us. We're smitten with technology. And we're afraid  like young lovers  that too much talking might spoil the romance. But it's time to talk. We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up. But it's not  it's early days. There's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it  how we build it. I'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices  just that we develop a more self aware relationship with them  with each other and with ourselves. I see some first steps. Start thinking of solitude as a good thing. Make room for it. Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children. Create sacred spaces at home    the kitchen  the dining room    and reclaim them for conversation. Do the same thing at work. At work  we're so busy communicating that we often don't have time to think  we don't have time to talk  about the things that really matter. Change that. Most important  we all really need to listen to each other  including to the boring bits. Because it's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other. Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection    how we care for each other  how we care for ourselves    but it's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. I'm optimistic. We have everything we need to start. We have each other. And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability. That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler. So in my work  I hear that life is hard  relationships are filled with risk. And then there's technology    simpler  hopeful  optimistic  ever young. It's like calling in the cavalry. An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars  you can  Finally  love your friends love your body  love your life  online and with avatars.  We're drawn to virtual romance  to computer games that seem like worlds  to the idea that robots  robots  will someday be our true companions. We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends. But our fantasies of substitution have cost us. Now we all need to focus on the many  many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives  our own bodies  our own communities  our own politics  our own planet. They need us. Let's talk about how we can use digital technology  the technology of our dreams  to make this life the life we can love. Thank you. Hi. I did that for two reasons. First of all  I wanted to give you a good visual first impression. But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic. I'm used to a stationary mic. It's the sensible shoe of public address. But you clamp this thing on my head  and something happens. I just become skanky. And I'm already off message. Ladies and gentlemen  I have devoted the past    years of my life to designing books. You cannot turn them off with a switch. Tell your kids.   It all sort of started as a benign mistake  like penicillin.  Laughter  What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City. But upon arrival there  in the fall of       and doing a lot of interviews  I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf  a book publisher. Now I was stupid  but not so stupid that I turned it down. I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of  and I was incredibly lucky. Soon  it had occurred to me what my job was. My job was to ask this question   What do the stories look like   Because that is what Knopf is. It is the story factory  one of the very best in the world. We bring stories to the public. The stories can be anything  and some of them are actually true. But they all have one thing in common  They all need to look like something. They all need a face. Why  To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into. A book designer gives form to content  but also manages a very careful balance between the two. Now  the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University  the teacher  Lanny Sommese  came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard  and wrote the word  Apple  underneath  and he said   OK. Lesson one. Listen up.  And he covered up the picture and he said   You either say this   and then he covered up the word   or you show this. But you don't do this.  Because this is treating your audience like a moron. And they deserve better. And lo and behold  soon enough  I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf. The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs  and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich. Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style  it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you. The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter  it was a biography. So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures  and so we did this. So there you are. Pure content and pure form  side by side. No fighting  ladies. Now  what is the story here  Someone is re engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber. Genius  Now  luckily for me  I live and work in New York City  where there are plenty of dinosaurs. So  I went to the Museum of Natural History  and I checked out the bones  and I went to the gift shop  and I bought a book. And I was particularly taken with this page of the book  and more specifically the lower right hand corner. Now I took this diagram  and I put it in a Photostat machine  and I took a piece of tracing paper  and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape    stop me if I'm going too fast    and then I took a Rapidograph pen    explain it to the youngsters    and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur. I had no idea what I was doing  I had no idea where I was going  but at some point  I stopped    when to keep going would seem like I was going too far. And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being. We're in the middle of the process. And then I just threw some typography on it. Very basic stuff  slightly suggestive of public park signage. Everybody in house loved it  and so off it goes to the author. And even back then  Michael was on the cutting edge. That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine. I miss Michael. And sure enough  somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image  just in case they might want to use it. Well  they used it. And I was thrilled. We all know it was an amazing movie  and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it. But not too long ago  I came upon this on the Web. No  that is not me. But whoever it is  I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like   Oh my God  that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh  I was so wasted.  But if you think about it  from my head to my hands to his leg. That's a responsibility. And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly. The book designer's responsibility is threefold  to the reader  to the publisher and  most of all  to the author. I want you to look at the author's book and say   Wow  I need to read that.  David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers  and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony. And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image  and he wanted to explore what was underlying that. For me  it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of. But when you do  you don't get what you expect. You get something that goes much deeper than that. And David especially loved this design because at book signings  which he does a lot of  he could take a magic marker and do this. Hello  Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called   Dry    and it's about his time in rehab. In his   s  he was a hotshot ad executive  and as Mad Men has told us  a raging alcoholic. He did not think so  however  but his coworkers did an intervention and they said   You are going to rehab  or you will be fired and you will die.  Now to me  this was always going to be a typographic solution  what I would call the opposite of Type    . What does that mean  Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography  you get the assignment of  select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type      right  Very simple stuff. This is going to be the opposite of that. I want this book to look like it's lying to you  desperately and hopelessly  the way an alcoholic would. The answer was the most low tech thing you can imagine. I set up the type  I printed it out on an Epson printer with water soluble ink  taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto  Then when we went to press  the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running. Not long after it came out  Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books. And this woman came up to it  and she squinted  and she took it to the register  and she said to the man behind the counter   This one's ruined.  And the guy behind the counter said   I know  lady. They all came in that way.  Now  that's a good printing job. A book cover is a distillation. It is a haiku  if you will  of the story. This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha  and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is when it's on your shelf  you get a shelf life of the Buddha  moving from one age to the next. All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book  but once the book designer has read the text  then he has to be an interpreter and a translator. This story was a real puzzle. This is what it's about. All right  so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together. And so  here's the design  right  And so here's the front and the spine  and it's flat. But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf. Ahh  We come upon them  the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out. Huhh  They've been discovered by the sultan. He will not be pleased. Huhh  And now the sultan is in danger. And now  we have to open it up to find out what's going to happen next. Try experiencing that on a Kindle. Don't get me started. Seriously. Much is to be gained by eBooks  ease  convenience  portability. But something is definitely lost  tradition  a sensual experience  the comfort of thingy ness    a little bit of humanity. Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf  He'd smell it. Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper  and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages. All those years  all those books  he never got tired of it. Now  I am all for the iPad  but trust me    smelling it will get you nowhere. Now the Apple guys are texting   Develop odor emission plug in.  And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story. A woman named Aomame in      Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom  she can't help but feel that  all of a sudden  she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left  but very similar  but different. And so  we're talking about parallel planes of existence  sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers. So how do we show this  We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich  but now we merge them. So we're talking about different planes  different pieces of paper. So this is on a semi transparent piece of velum. It's one part of the form and content. When it's on top of the paper board  which is the opposite  it forms this. So even if you don't know anything about this book  you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence. And the object itself invited exploration interaction  consideration and touch. This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list. This is unheard of  both for us the publisher  and the author. We're talking a     page book that is as weird as it is compelling  and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode. Not exactly Jackie Collins. Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list  eight printings  and still going strong. So even though we love publishing as an art  we very much know it's a business too  and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky  that great art can be great business. So that's my story. To be continued. What does it look like  Yes. It can  it does and it will  but for this book designer  page turner  dog eared place holder  notes in the margins taker  ink sniffer  the story looks like this. Thank you. You know  cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy. For students  it's quite an experience  but for a school  it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain. So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught  they do not have a cadaver dissection lab. Maybe those reasons  or depending on where you are  cadavers may not be easily available. So to address this  we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford  virtual dissection table. So we call this Anatomage Table. So with this Anatomage Table  students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver. And the table form is important  and since it's touch interactive  just like the way they do dissections in the lab  or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table. Our digital body is one to one life size  so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy. I'm going to do some demonstrations. As you can see  I use my finger to interact with my digital body. I'm going to do some cuts. I can cut any way I want to  so I cut right here. Then it's going to show inside. And I can change my cut to see different parts. Maybe I can cut there  see the brain  and I can change my cut. You can see some internal organs. So we call this the slicer mode. OK  I'm going to do another cut. Right there. This shows a lot of internal structures. So if I want to see the back side  I can flip and see from behind. Like this. So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you  that means we did the right job. So our doctors said these are eye candies. So instead of just butchering the body  I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections. What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin  muscles and bones  just to see a few internal organs. Right here. Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here. OK. Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart. I'm going to do some surgery here. I'm going to cut some veins  arteries. Oops  ... You don't want to hear  oops  in real surgery. But fortunately  our digital man has  undo.  Okay. All right then. Let me zoom in. I'm going to make a cut right there. And then you can see the inside of the heart. You can see the atrium and the ventricles  how blood flows to our arteries and veins. Just like this  students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to. It doesn't have to be always dissection. Since it's digital  we can do reverse dissection. So let me show you  I'm going to start with the skeletal structure  and I can add a few internal organs. Yep. Maybe I can add quickly this way. And I can build muscles gradually  just like that. We can see tendons and muscles. Wish I could build my muscle this fast. And this is another way to learn anatomy. Another thing I can show you is  more often than not  doctors get to meet patients in X ray form. So  Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X ray. You can also interact with your X ray  and also if you want  you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X ray  too. So when you are done  just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session. It looks like our table also can transform gender  too. It's a female now. So this is Anatomage Table. Thank you. I call myself a body architect. I trained in classical ballet and have a background in architecture and fashion. As a body architect  I fascinate with the human body and explore how I can transform it. I worked at Philips Electronics in the far future design research lab  looking    years into the future. I explored the human skin  and how technology can transform the body. I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo  which is augmented by touch  or dresses that blushed and shivered with light. I started my own experiments. These were the low tech approaches to the high tech conversations I was having. These are Q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue. I started a collaboration with a friend of mine  Bart Hess    he doesn't normally look like this    and we used ourselves as models. We transformed our apartments into our laboratories  and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way. We were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution. Whilst I was at Philips  we discussed this idea of a maybe technology  something that wasn't either switched on or off  but in between. A maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid. And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body  so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started. I set up my studio in the red light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing  and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile. I was introduced to Robyn  the Swedish pop star  and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion. And she talked about how technology with these new feathers  this new face paint  this punk  the way that we identify with the world  and we made this music video. I'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology  and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology  in the future  away from disease and aging. And I thought about this concept of  imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor  modify and biologically enhance it  and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other  Or the way that we attract sexual partners  And would we revert back to being more like animals  more primal modes of communication  I worked with a synthetic biologist  and I created a swallowable perfume  which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire. It completely blows apart the way that perfume is  and provides a whole new format. It's perfume coming from the inside out. It redefines the role of skin  and our bodies become an atomizer. I've learned that there's no boundaries  and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense. But when I look towards the future  the next project is completely unknown and wide open. I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me  and it's these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas  and they kind of instinctively come out. As a body architect  I've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want. And I feel like I've just got started. So here's to another day at the office. Thank you  Thank you  Tonight  I want to have a conversation about this incredible global issue that's at the intersection of land use  food and environment  something we can all relate to  and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth. But first  I want to take you on a little journey. Let's first visit our planet  but at night  and from space. This is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime  if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet. And the thing you would notice first  of course  is how dominant the human presence on our planet is. We see cities  we see oil fields  you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea  that we are dominating much of our planet  and mostly through the use of energy that we see here at night. But let's go back and drop it a little deeper and look during the daytime. What we see during the day is our landscapes. This is part of the Amazon Basin  a place called Rond nia in the south center part of the Brazilian Amazon. If you look really carefully in the upper right hand corner  you're going to see a thin white line  which is a road that was built in the     s. If we come back to the same place in       what we're going to find is that these roads spurt off more roads  and more roads after that  at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest where there are going to be a few cows. These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows. And these cows are eaten basically in South America  in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here. But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation is something we notice a lot of around the tropics  especially in this part of the world. If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world  we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon  here also in       and if you look really carefully  there's a thin white line through that kind of seam  and there's a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle. Let's come back again a few years later  here in       and we'll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest. In fact  what you're seeing here are soybean fields. These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China as animal feed  especially after the mad cow disease scare about a decade ago  where we don't want to feed animals animal protein anymore  because that can transmit disease. Instead  we want to feed them more vegetable proteins. So soybeans have really exploded  showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the Amazon    an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today. Well  again and again  what we find as we look around the world in our little tour of the world is that landscape after landscape after landscape have been cleared and altered for growing food and other crops. So one of the questions we've been asking is  how much of the world is used to grow food  and where is it exactly  and how can we change that into the future  and what does it mean  Well  our team has been looking at this on a global scale  using satellite data and ground based data kind of to track farming on a global scale. And this is what we found  and it's startling. This map shows the presence of agriculture on planet Earth. The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops  like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever. That's    million square kilometers' worth of land. If you put it all together in one place  it'd be the size of South America. The second area  in brown  is the world's pastures and rangelands  where our animals live. That area's about    million square kilometers  or about an Africa's worth of land  a huge amount of land  and it's the best land  of course  is what you see. And what's left is  like  the middle of the Sahara Desert  or Siberia  or the middle of a rain forest. We're using a planet's worth of land already. If we look at this carefully  we find it's about    percent of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture  and it's    times larger than all the areas we complain about  our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live. Half of humanity lives in cities today  but a    times larger area is used to grow food. So this is an amazing kind of result  and it really shocked us when we looked at that. So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture  but also we're using a lot of water. This is a photograph flying into Arizona  and when you look at it  you're like   What are they growing here   It turns out they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top. Now  the irony is  it's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities. But what's really interesting is  this water's got to come from some place  and it comes from here  the Colorado River in North America. Well  the Colorado on a typical day in the     s  this is just  you know  not a flood  not a drought  kind of an average day  it looks something like this. But if we come back today  during a normal condition to the exact same location  this is what's left. The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food  or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale  you take your pick. Well  this is a lot of water  and again  we're mining water and using it to grow food  and today  if you travel down further down the Colorado  it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean. We've literally consumed an entire river in North America for irrigation. Well  that's not even the worst example in the world. This probably is  the Aral Sea. Now  a lot you will remember this from your geography classes. This is in the former Soviet Union in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan  one of the great inland seas of the world. But there's kind of a paradox here  because it looks like it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here  The reason it's here is because  on the right hand side  you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand  feeding this basin with water. Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east  where snow melts  it travels down the river through the desert  and forms the great Aral Sea. Well  in the     s  the Soviets decided to divert that water to irrigate the desert to grow cotton  believe it or not  in Kazakhstan  to sell cotton to the international markets to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union. They really needed the money. Well  you can imagine what happens. You turn off the water supply to the Aral Sea  what's going to happen  Here it is in                         and about    months ago. It's pretty extraordinary. Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest. Imagine that was Lake Superior. Imagine that was Lake Huron. It's an extraordinary change. This is not only a change in water and where the shoreline is  this is a change in the fundamentals of the environment of this region. Let's start with this. The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club. Let's put it that way. So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty. There's a lot of toxic waste  a lot of things that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne. One of those small islands that was remote and impossible to get to was a site of Soviet biological weapons testing. You can walk there today. Weather patterns have changed. Nineteen of the unique    fish species found only in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth. This is an environmental disaster writ large. But let's bring it home. This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago that he took when he was in the Soviet Union a long  long time ago  showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea. You see the canal they dug  They were so desperate to try to  kind of  float the boats into the remaining pools of water  but they finally had to give up because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't keep up with the retreating shoreline. I don't know about you  but I'm terrified that future archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about our time in history  and wonder   What were you thinking   Well  that's the future we have to look forward to. We already use about    percent of the Earth's fresh water that's sustainable  and agriculture alone is    percent of that. So we use a lot of water  a lot of land for agriculture. We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture. Usually when we think about the atmosphere  we think about climate change and greenhouse gases  and mostly around energy  but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases too. If you look at carbon dioxide from burning tropical rainforest  or methane coming from cows and rice  or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers  it turns out agriculture is    percent of the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere from human activity. That's more than all our transportation. It's more than all our electricity. It's more than all other manufacturing  in fact. It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases of any human activity in the world. And yet  we don't talk about it very much. So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet  whether it's    percent of our land surface     percent of the water we use     percent of our greenhouse gas emissions. We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers  causing huge problems of water quality from rivers  lakes  and even oceans  and it's also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss. So without a doubt  agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. No question. And it rivals climate change in importance. And they're both happening at the same time. But what's really important here to remember is that it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing. In fact  we completely depend on it. It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity. We have to provide food and feed and  yeah  fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people in the world today  and if anything  we're going to have the demands on agriculture increase into the future. It's not going to go away. It's going to get a lot bigger  mainly because of growing population. We're seven billion people today heading towards at least nine  probably nine and a half before we're done. More importantly  changing diets. As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous  we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat  which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does. So more people  eating more stuff  and richer stuff  and of course having an energy crisis at the same time  where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio energy sources. So you put these together. It's really hard to see how we're going to get to the rest of the century without at least doubling global agricultural production. Well  how are we going to do this  How are going to double global ag production around the world  Well  we could try to farm more land. This is an analysis we've done  where on the left is where the crops are today  on the right is where they could be based on soils and climate  assuming climate change doesn't disrupt too much of this  which is not a good assumption. We could farm more land  but the problem is the remaining lands are in sensitive areas. They have a lot of biodiversity  a lot of carbon  things we want to protect. So we could grow more food by expanding farmland  but we'd better not  because it's ecologically a very  very dangerous thing to do. Instead  we maybe want to freeze the footprint of agriculture and farm the lands we have better. This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places in the world where we could improve yields without harming the environment. The green areas here show where corn yields  just showing corn as an example  are already really high  probably the maximum you could find on Earth today for that climate and soil  but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we're only getting maybe    or    percent of the yield you should be able to get. You see a lot of this in Africa  even Latin America  but interestingly  Eastern Europe  where Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries used to be  is still a mess agriculturally. Now  this would require nutrients and water. It's going to either be organic or conventional or some mix of the two to deliver that. Plants need water and nutrients. But we can do this  and there are opportunities to make this work. But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive to meeting the food security needs of the future and the environmental security needs of the future. We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better. Right now  it's kind of an all or nothing proposition. We can grow food in the background    that's a soybean field   and in this flower diagram  it shows we grow a lot of food  but we don't have a lot clean water  we're not storing a lot of carbon  we don't have a lot of biodiversity. In the foreground  we have this prairie that's wonderful from the environmental side  but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat  We need to figure out how to bring both of those together into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together. Now  when I talk about this  people often tell me   Well  isn't blank the answer      organic food  local food  GMOs  new trade subsidies  new farm bills    and yeah  we have a lot of good ideas here  but not any one of these is a silver bullet. In fact  what I think they are is more like silver buckshot. And I love silver buckshot. You put it together and you've got something really powerful  but we need to put them together. So what we have to do  I think  is invent a new kind of agriculture that blends the best ideas of commercial agriculture and the green revolution with the best ideas of organic farming and local food and the best ideas of environmental conservation  not to have them fighting each other but to have them collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture  something I call  terraculture   or farming for a whole planet. Now  having this conversation has been really hard  and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points to people to reduce the controversy  to increase the collaboration. I want to show you a short video that does kind of show our efforts right now to bring these sides together into a single conversation. So let me show you that. by    million people each year. That's almost the size of Germany. Today  we're nearing   billion people. At this rate  we'll reach   billion people by     . And we all need food. But how  How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet  We already know climate change is a big problem. But it's not the only problem. We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.' A global crisis in agriculture. Population growth   meat consumption   dairy consumption   energy costs   bioenergy production   stress on natural resources. More than     of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture. Global croplands cover    million km . That's almost the size of South America. Global pastures cover    million km . That's the size of Africa. Agriculture uses    times more land than urban and suburban areas combined. Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet. We use       cubic kilometers of water on crops every year. That's enough to fill       Empire State Buildings every day. Today  many large rivers have reduced flows. Some dry up altogether. Look at the Aral Sea  now turned to desert. Or the Colorado River  which no longer flows to the ocean. Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment. The consequence  Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers. Surprisingly  agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change. It generates     of greenhouse gas emissions. That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry  or from all the world's planes  trains and automobiles. Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation  methane from animals and rice fields  and nitrous oxide from over fertilizing. There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture. And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival. Here's the dilemma... As the world grows by several billion more people  We'll need to double  maybe even triple  global food production. So where do we go from here  We need a bigger conversation  an international dialogue. We need to invest in real solutions  incentives for farmers  precision agriculture  new crop varieties  drip irrigation  gray water recycling  better tillage practices  smarter diets. We need everyone at the table. Advocates of commercial agriculture  environmental conservation  and organic farming... must work together. There is no single solution. We need collaboration  imagination  determination  because failure is not an option. How do we feed the world without destroying it  Yeah  so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today  the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly  at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations. This is going to be one of the hardest things we ever have done in human history  and we absolutely have to get it right  and we have to get it right on our first and only try. So thanks very much.  Applause  Hi  my name is Frank  and I collect secrets. It all started with a crazy idea in November of     . I printed up       self addressed postcards  just like this. They were blank on one side  and on the other side I listed some simple instructions. I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they'd never told anyone before. And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington  D.C.  not knowing what to expect. But soon the idea began spreading virally. People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards. I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox  not just with postmarks from Washington  D.C.  but from Texas  California  Vancouver  New Zealand  Iraq. Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy. PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement free blog in the world. And this is my postcard collection today. You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets. What I'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection  starting with this one.  I found these stamps as a child  and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to. I never did have someone.  Secrets can take many forms. They can be shocking or silly or soulful. They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet. Maybe one of you sent this one in. I don't know. This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard. This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.  Dear Birthmother  I have great parents. I've found love. I'm happy.  Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas  of frailty and heroism  playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now.  Everyone who knew me before      believes I'm dead.   I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people  so sometimes I didn't wear panties  and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself.  This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you. I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students. And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students. And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos. And I should also mention that  just like today  at that PostSecret event  I was using a wireless microphone.  Your mic wasn't off during sound check. We all heard you pee.  This was really embarrassing when it happened  until I realized it could have been worse. Right. You know what I'm saying.  Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn't use. I feel like the happiest person on Earth  now.    One of these men is the father of my son. He pays me a lot to keep it a secret.   That Saturday when you wondered where I was  well  I was getting your ring. It's in my pocket right now.  I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day. It was the very bottom  the last secret in the long column. And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard. And he said   Frank  I've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life.  He said   My knees are still shaking.  He said   For three years  my girlfriend and I  we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud. I read some to her  she reads some to me.  He says   It's really brought us closer together through the years. And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom  I was beside myself. And I tried to act calm  not to give anything away. And just like every Sunday  we started reading the secrets out loud to each other.  He said   But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one.  But she finally did. She got to that bottom secret  his proposal to her. And he said   She read it once and then she read it again.  And she turned to him and said   Is that our cat   And when she saw him  he was down on one knee  he had the ring out. He popped the question  she said yes. It was a very happy ending. So I emailed him back and I said   Please share with me an image  something  that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending.  And he emailed me this picture.  I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer. I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you.  This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it  but this secret has impacted many lives  starting with a student up in Canada named Matty. Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website  a website called IFoundYourCamera. Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found  memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos. And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week. And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for. This one's my favorite. Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers. And it might seem like a simple idea  and it is  but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge. Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture.  That's me  my husband and son. The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother. Thank you for making your site. These pictures mean more to me than you know. My son's birth is on this camera. He turns four tomorrow.  Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it    sometimes crossing oceans  sometimes going through language barriers. This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.  When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again.  When I posted this secret  dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones  sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years  messages from family or friends who had died. They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them  it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive. One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother. Secrets can take many forms. They can be shocking or silly or soulful. They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again. Voicemail recording  First saved voice message. Grandma    It's somebody's birthday today     Somebody's birthday today     The candles are lighted     on somebody's cake     And we're all invited     for somebody's sake   You're    years old today. Have a real happy birthday  and I love you. I'll say bye for now. FW  Thank you. Thank you. June Cohen  Frank  that was beautiful  so touching. Have you ever sent yourself a postcard  Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret  FW  I have one of my own secrets in every book. I think in some ways  the reason I started the project  even though I didn't know it at the time  was because I was struggling with my own secrets. And it was through crowd sourcing  it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me  that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me. JC  And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book  Has anyone in your life been able to tell  FW  Sometimes I share that information  yeah. I was born in Den Bosch  where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after. And so I've always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the   th century. And what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning  and he was sort of wondering  I think  what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion. And so he painted this famous painting   The Garden of Earthly Delights   which some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall  or being humanity without any Fall at all. And so it makes you wonder  what would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge  so to speak  and what kind of morality would we have  Much later  as a student  I went to a very different garden  a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees. This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee. And I discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it. And at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition. I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom  and humanity included  was that deep down we are competitors  we are aggressive  we're all out for our own profit basically. This is the launch of my book. I'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it  but they surely seemed interested in the book. Now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on  I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights. And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight. They ended up in a tree  and one of them holds out a hand to the other. And about a second after I took the picture  they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other. Now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression  and so it wouldn't make any sense. The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose. But why would you reconcile after a fight  That doesn't make any sense. This is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex. And so they also reconcile with sex. But the principle is exactly the same. The principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict  so you need to do something about it. So my whole picture of the animal kingdom  and including humans also  started to change at that time. So we have this image in political science  economics  the humanities  philosophy for that matter  that man is a wolf to man. And so deep down our nature's actually nasty. I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf. The wolf is  after all  a very cooperative animal. And that's why many of you have a dog at home  which has all these characteristics also. And it's really unfair to humanity  because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for. So I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals. So these are the pillars of morality. If you ask anyone   What is morality based on   these are the two factors that always come out. One is reciprocity  and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness. And the other one is empathy and compassion. And human morality is more than this  but if you would remove these two pillars  there would be not much remaining I think. And so they're absolutely essential. So let me give you a few examples here. This is a very old video  from the Yerkes Primate Center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate.          So this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation. What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box  and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in. And of course  there's food on the box. Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard. And so they're bringing in the box. And you can see that they're synchronized. You can see that they work together  they pull at the same moment. It's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn't be able to do that. And now you're going to get a more interesting picture  because now one of the two chimps has been fed. So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.       and sometimes appears to convey its wishes and meanings by gestures.   Now look at what happens  at the very end of this. He takes basically everything. So there are two interesting parts about this. One is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner    so a full understanding of the need for cooperation. The second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he's not interested in the food. Why would that be  Well that probably has to do with reciprocity. There's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors. So he will get a return favor at some point in the future. And so that's how this all operates. We do the same task with elephants. Now with elephants  it's very dangerous to work with elephants. Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant. Now you can probably make it  but it's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think. And so what we did in that case    we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik    is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope  a single rope. And if you pull on this side of the rope  the rope disappears on the other side. So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull. Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears. And the first tape you're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus. The apparatus is on the left with food on it. And so they come together  they arrive together  they pick it up together and they pull together. So it's actually fairly simple for them. There they are. And so that's how they bring it in. But now we're going to make it more difficult. Because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation. Do they understand that as well as the chimps  for example  And so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other  and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope    because if he pulls at the rope  it disappears and the whole test is over. Now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it. But it shows the understanding that he has  because he puts his big foot on the rope  stands on the rope and waits there for the other  and then the other is going to do all the work for him. So it's what we call freeloading. But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have. They develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily. So the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in. Now look at the other. The other doesn't forget to eat  of course. This was the cooperation  reciprocity part. Now something on empathy. Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research. And empathy has sort of two qualities. One is the understanding part of it. This is just a regular definition  the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. And the emotional part. And so empathy has basically two channels. One is the body channel. If you talk with a sad person  you're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture  and before you know it you feel sad. And that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy  which many animals have. Your average dog has that also. That's actually why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don't have that kind of empathy. And then there's a cognitive channel  which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else. And that's more limited. There's few animals    I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing    but there are very few animals who can do that. So synchronization  which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom. And in humans  of course  we can study that with yawn contagion. Humans yawn when others yawn. And it's related to empathy. It activates the same areas in the brain. Also  we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic. People who have problems with empathy  such as autistic children  they don't have yawn contagion. So it is connected. And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head. So that's what you see on the upper left  an animated head that yawns. And there's a chimpanzee watching  an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations. So yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with    and maybe you're going to start yawning soon now    is something that we share with other animals. And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically. Now we also study more complex expressions. This is consolation. This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming  and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down. That's consolation. It's very similar to human consolation. And consolation behavior  it's empathy driven. Actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed  and then they see what young children do. And so it is related to empathy  and that's the kind of expressions we look at. We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about. It's on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is  do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else  And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that  that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else. Now we did a very simple experiment. We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville  in the field station of Yerkes. And so that's how they live. And we call them into a room and do experiments with them. In this case  we put two chimpanzees side by side. and one has a bucket full of tokens  and the tokens have different meanings. One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses  the other one feeds both of them. So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner. And here you have the two color tokens. So they have a whole bucket full of them. And they have to pick one of the two colors. You will see how that goes. So if this chimp makes the selfish choice  which is the red token in this case  he needs to give it to us. So we pick it up  we put it on a table where there's two food rewards  but in this case only the one on the right gets food. The one on the left walks away because she knows already. that this is not a good test for her. Then the next one is the pro social token. So the one who makes the choices    that's the interesting part here    for the one who makes the choices  it doesn't really matter. So she gives us now a pro social token and both chimps get fed. So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward. So it doesn't matter whatsoever. And she should actually be choosing blindly. But what we find is that they prefer the pro social token. So this is the    percent line that's the random expectation. And especially if the partner draws attention to itself  they choose more. And if the partner puts pressure on them    so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them    then the choices go down. It's as if they're saying   If you're not behaving  I'm not going to be pro social today.  And this is what happens without a partner  when there's no partner sitting there. And so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well being of somebody else    especially  these are other members of their own group. So the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study. And so this became a very famous study. And there's now many more  because after we did this about    years ago  it became very well known. And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys. And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did. It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees. But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys. So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side by side. Again  these animals  they live in a group  they know each other. We take them out of the group  put them in a test chamber. And there's a very simple task that they need to do. And if you give both of them cucumber for the task  the two monkeys side by side  they're perfectly willing to do this    times in a row. So cucumber  even though it's only really water in my opinion  but cucumber is perfectly fine for them. Now if you give the partner grapes    the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket    and so if you give them grapes    it's a far better food    then you create inequity between them. So that's the experiment we did. Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who'd never done the task  thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction  and that turned out to be right. The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber. The one on the right is the one who gets grapes. The one who gets cucumber  note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine. The first piece she eats. Then she sees the other one getting grape  and you will see what happens. So she gives a rock to us. That's the task. And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it. The other one needs to give a rock to us. And that's what she does. And she gets a grape and she eats it. The other one sees that. She gives a rock to us now  gets  again  cucumber. She tests a rock now against the wall. She needs to give it to us. And she gets cucumber again. So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here. Let me tell you    I still have two minutes left  let me tell you a funny story about this. This study became very famous and we got a lot of comments  especially anthropologists  economists  philosophers. They didn't like this at all. Because they had decided in their minds  I believe  that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it. And so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution. Now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes. Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan  who's been doing this with chimpanzees  had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where  indeed  the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape. So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness. And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile. So let me summarize. I believe there's an evolved morality. I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about  but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates  which are empathy and consolation  pro social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness. And so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up  so to speak  without necessarily God and religion involved  and to see how we can get to an evolved morality. And I thank you for your attention. Today  I'd like to talk with you about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic. But  unfortunately  it's become incredibly controversial. This year  if you think about it  over a billion couples will have sex with one another. Couples like this one  and this one  and this one  and  yes  even this one. And my idea is this    all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child. And they should be able to use one of these birth control methods to act on their decision. Now  I think you'd have a hard time finding many people who disagree with this idea. Over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all. They want the power to plan their own lives and to raise healthier  better educated and more prosperous families. But  for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private  birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public. Some people think when we talk about contraception that it's code for abortion  which it's not. Some people    let's be honest    they're uncomfortable with the topic because it's about sex. Some people worry that the real goal of family planning is to control populations. These are all side issues that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women should be able to decide when they want to have a child. And as a result  birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared from the global health agenda. The victims of this paralysis are the people of sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. Here in Germany  the proportion of people that use contraception is about    percent. That's about what you'd expect. In El Salvador  very similar     percent. Thailand     percent. But let's compare that to other places  like Uttar Pradesh  one of the largest states in India. In fact  if Uttar Pradesh was its own country  it would be the fifth largest country in the world. Their contraception rate       percent. Nigeria  the most populous country in Africa     percent. Chad    percent. Let's just take one country in Africa  Senegal. Their rate is about    percent. But why is it so low  One reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available. Women in Africa will tell you over and over again that what they prefer today is an injectable. They get it in their arm    and they go about four times a year  they have to get it every three months    to get their injection. The reason women like it so much in Africa is they can hide it from their husbands  who sometimes want a lot of children. The problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal  that injection is stocked out. It's stocked out     days out of the year. So can you imagine the situation    she walks all this way to go get her injection. She leaves her field  sometimes leaves her children  and it's not there. And she doesn't know when it's going to be available again. This is the same story across the continent of Africa today. And so what we've created as a world has become a life and death crisis. There are         women  per year  who say they don't want to be pregnant and they die in childbirth            women a year. There are another         women  per year  who say they didn't want to be pregnant in the first place  and they give birth to a baby and her baby dies in that first month of life. I know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children. But somewhere along the way  we got confused by our own conversation. And we stopped trying to save these lives. So if we're going to make progress on this issue  we have to be really clear about what our agenda is. We're not talking about abortion. We're not talking about population control. What I'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives  to save their children's lives and to give their families the best possible future. Now  as a world  there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community if we want to make the world better in the future    things like fight diseases. So many children today die of diarrhea  as you heard earlier  and pneumonia. They kill literally millions of children a year. We also need to help small farmers    farmers who plow small plots of land in Africa    so that they can grow enough food to feed their children. And we have to make sure that children are educated around the world. But one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do is to give everybody access to birth control methods that almost all Germans have access to and all Americans  at some point  they use these tools during their life. And I think as long as we're really clear about what our agenda is  there's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea. When I grew up  I grew up in a Catholic home. I still consider myself a practicing Catholic. My mom's great uncle was a Jesuit priest. My great aunt was a Dominican nun. She was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life. In fact  she's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read. I was very close to her. And I went to Catholic schools for my entire childhood until I left home to go to university. In my high school  Ursuline Academy  the nuns made service and social justice a high priority in the school. Today  in the  Gates  Foundation's work  I believe I'm applying the lessons that I learned in high school. So  in the tradition of Catholic scholars  the nuns also taught us to question received teachings. And one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned was is birth control really a sin  Because I think one of the reasons we have this huge discomfort talking about contraception is this lingering concern that if we separate sex from reproduction  we're going to promote promiscuity. And I think that's a reasonable question to be asked about contraception    what is its impact on sexual morality  But  like most women  my decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity. I had a plan for my future. I wanted to go to college. I studied really hard in college  and I was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates at my university. I wanted to have a career  so I went on to business school and I became one of the youngest female executives at Microsoft. I still remember  though  when I left my parents' home to move across the country to start this new job at Microsoft. They had sacrificed a lot to give me five years of higher education. But they said  as I left home    and I literally went down the front steps  down the porch at home    and they said   Even though you've had this great education  if you decide to get married and have kids right away  that's OK by us  too.  They wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest. I was free to decide what that would be. It was an amazing feeling. In fact  I did want to have kids    but I wanted to have them when I was ready. And so now  Bill and I have three. And when our eldest daughter was born  we weren't  I would say  exactly sure how to be great parents. Maybe some of you know that feeling. And so we waited a little while before we had our second child. And it's no accident that we have three children that are spaced three years apart. Now  as a mother  what do I want the very most for my children  I want them to feel the way I did    like they can do anything they want to do in life. And so  what has struck me as I've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world is that all women want that same thing. Last year  I was in Nairobi  in the slums  in one called Korogocho    which literally means when translated   standing shoulder to shoulder.  And I spoke with this women's group that's pictured here. And the women talked very openly about their family life in the slums  what it was like. And they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control. Marianne  in the center of the screen in the red sweater  she summed up that entire two hour conversation in a phrase that I will never forget. She said   I want to bring every good thing to this child before I have another.  And I thought    that's it. That's universal. We all want to bring every good thing to our children. But what's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing. So many women suffer from domestic violence. And they can't even broach the subject of contraception  even inside their own marriage. There are many women who lack basic education. Even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power don't have access to contraceptives. For     years  parents around the world have been deciding to have smaller families. This trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium  across cultures and across geographies  with the glaring exception of sub Saharan Africa and South Asia. The French started bringing down their family size in the mid     s. And over the next     years  this trend spread all across Europe. The surprising thing to me  as I learned this history  was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines. People who spoke the same language made that change as a group. They made the same choice for their family  whether they were rich or whether they were poor. The reason that trend toward smaller families spread was that this whole way was driven by an idea    the idea that couples can exercise conscious control over how many children they have. This is a very powerful idea. It means that parents have the ability to affect the future  not just accept it as it is. In France  the average family size went down every decade for     years in a row until it stabilized. It took so long back then because the contraceptives weren't that good. In Germany  this transition started in the     s  and it took just    years for family size to stabilize in this country. And in Asia and Latin America  the transition started in the     s  and it happened much faster because of modern contraception. I think  as we go through this history  it's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue. It's because some family planning programs resorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies. For instance  in the     s  India adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an IUD placed in their bodies. Now  Indian women were really smart in this situation. When they went to get an IUD inserted  they got paid six rupees. And so what did they do  They waited a few hours or a few days  and they went to another service provider and had the IUD removed for one rupee. For decades in the United States  African American women were sterilized without their consent. The procedure was so common it became known as the Mississippi appendectomy    a tragic chapter in my country's history. And as recently as the     s  in Peru  women from the Andes region were given anesthesia and they were sterilized without their knowledge. The most startling thing about this is that these coercive policies weren't even needed. They were carried out in places where parents already wanted to lower their family size. Because in region after region  again and again  parents have wanted to have smaller families. There's no reason to believe that African women have innately different desires. Given the option  they will have fewer children. The question is  will we invest in helping all women get what they want now  Or  are we going to condemn them to some century long struggle  as if this was still revolutionary France and the best method was coitus interruptus  Empowering parents    it doesn't need justification. But here's the thing    our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world. It's what propels societies forward. In that same slum in Nairobi  I met a young businesswoman  and she was making backpacks out of her home. She and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory and collect scraps of denim. She'd create these backpacks and resell them. And when I talked with her  she had three children  and I asked her about her family. And she said she and her husband decided that they wanted to stop having children after their third one. And so when I asked her why  she simply said   Well  because I couldn't run my business if I had another child.  And she explained the income that she was getting out of her business afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children. She was incredibly optimistic about her family's future. This is the same mental calculus that hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through. And evidence proves that they have it exactly right. They are able to give their children more opportunities by exercising control over when they have them. In Bangladesh  there's a district called Matlab. It's where researchers have collected data on over         inhabitants since     . In the global health community  we like to say it's one of the longest pieces of research that's been running. We have so many great health statistics. In one of the studies  what did they do  Half the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives. They got education and access to contraception. Twenty years later  following those villages  what we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors. The families were healthier. The women were less likely to die in childbirth. Their children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life. The children were better nourished. The families were also wealthier. The adult women's wages were higher. Households had more assets    things like livestock or land or savings. Finally  their sons and daughters had more schooling. So when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families  the product can be large scale economic development. People talk about the Asian economic miracle of the     s    but it wasn't really a miracle. One of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend towards smaller families. Sweeping changes start at the individual family level    the family making a decision about what's best for their children. When they make that change and that decision  those become sweeping regional and national trends. When families in sub Saharan Africa are given the opportunity to make those decisions for themselves  I think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development in communities across the continent. We can help poor families build a better future. We can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods. I think the goal here is really clear  universal access to birth control that women want. And for that to happen  it means that both rich and poor governments alike must make contraception a total priority. We can do our part  in this room and globally  by talking about the hundreds of millions of families that don't have access to contraception today and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access. I think if Marianne and the members of her women's group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public  we can  too. And we need to start now. Because like Marianne  we all want to bring every good thing to our children. And where is the controversy in that  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. I have some questions for Melinda. Thank you for your courage and everything else. So  Melinda  in the last few years I've heard a lot of smart people say something to the effect of   We don't need to worry about the population issue anymore. Family sizes are coming down naturally all over the world. We're going to peak at nine or    billion. And that's it.  Are they wrong  Melinda Gates  If you look at the statistics across Africa  they are wrong. And I think we need to look at it  though  from a different lens. We need to look at it from the ground upwards. I think that's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble on this issue of contraception. We looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time. Yes  we care about the planet. Yes  we need to make the right choices. But the choices have to be made at the family level. And it's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those sweeping changes that we have seen globally    except for sub Saharan Africa and those places in South Asia and Afghanistan. CA  Some people on the right in America and in many conservative cultures around the world might say something like this   It's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on. But  sex is sacred. What you're proposing is going to increase the likelihood that lots of sex happens outside marriage. And that is wrong.  What would you say to them  MG  I would say that sex is absolutely sacred. And it's sacred in Germany  and it's sacred in the United States  and it's sacred in France and so many places around the world. And the fact that    percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced say they use birth control doesn't make sex any less sacred. It just means that they're getting to make choices about their lives. And I think in that choice  we're also honoring the sacredness of the family and the sacredness of the mother's life and the childrens' lives by saving their lives. To me  that's incredibly sacred  too. CA  So what is your foundation doing to promote this issue  And what could people here and people listening on the web    what would you like them to do  MG  I would say this    join the conversation. We've listed the website up here. Join the conversation. Tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life or somebody's life that you know. And say that you're for this. We need a groundswell of people saying   This makes sense. We've got to give all women access    no matter where they live.  And one of the things that we're going to do is do a large event July    in London  with a whole host of countries  a whole host of African nations  to all say we're putting this back on the global health agenda. We're going to commit resources to it  and we're going to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educated    so that if they want the tool  they have it  and that they have lots of options available either through their local healthcare worker or their local community rural clinic. CA  Melinda  I'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you at school are going to see this TED Talk at some point. Are they going to be horrified  or are they cheering you on  MG  I know they're going to see the TED Talk because they know that I'm doing it and I plan to send it to them. And  you know  the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive. I hope that they'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service. I have come to feel incredibly passionate about this issue because of what I've seen in the developing world. And for me  this topic has become very close to heart because you meet these women and they are so often voiceless. And yet they shouldn't be    they should have a voice  they should have access. And so I hope they'll feel that I'm living out what I've learned from them and from the decades of work that I've already done at the foundation. CA  So  you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers to whom we're all grateful. Did you learn anything  MG  Oh my gosh  I learned so many things. I have so many follow up questions. And I think a lot of this work is a journey. You heard the discussion about the journey through energy  or the journey through social design  or the journey in the coming and saying   Why aren't there any women on this platform   And I think for all of us who work on these development issues  you learn by talking to other people. You learn by doing. You learn by trying and making mistakes. And it's the questions you ask. Sometimes it's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it. So I have lots of questions for the panelists from today. And I thought it was just an amazing day. CA  Melinda  thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you. Thank you so much. MG  Great. Thanks  Chris. I'm a process engineer  I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters  and cyclones  and things like that. But I also have Marfan syndrome. This is an inherited disorder. And in       I participated in a genetic study  and found to my horror  as you can see from the slide  that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range  the green line at the bottom. Everyone in here will be between  .   .   and I was already up at  . . And as you can see  my aorta dilated progressively  and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary. The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome. Anesthetize you  open your chest  put you on an artificial heart and lung machine  drop your body temperature to about    centigrade  stop your heart  cut the aorta out  replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta. And most importantly  commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy. Normally  warfarin. The thought of the surgery was not attractive. The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening. So I said to myself   I'm an engineer  I'm in R D  this is just a plumbing problem.   I can do this  I can change this.  So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation. The project aim is really quite simple. The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is that it lacks some tensile strength. So  the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe  and it would remain stable and operate quite happily. If your high pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little  you just wrap some tape around it  it really is that simple. In concept  though not in execution. The great advantage of an external support  for me  was that I could retain all of my own bits  all of my own endothelium and valves  and not need any anticoagulation therapy. So  where do we start  This is a sagittal slice through me. In the middle  you can see that little structure squeezing out  that's the left ventricle  pushing blood out through the aortic valve. You can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there. Up into the ascending aorta. And it's that part  the ascending aorta  which dilates and ultimately bursts  which of course is fatal. We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance and CT imaging machines  from which to make a model of the patient's aorta. This is a model of my aorta. I've got a real one in my pocket  if anyone would like to look at it  and play with it. You can see it's quite a complex structure. It has a funny tri lobal shape at the bottom  which contains the aortic valve. It then comes back into a round form  and then tapers and curves off. It's quite a difficult structure to produce. This is a sort of CAD model of me  and this is one of the later CAD models. We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models. When we produced that model  we turned it into a solid  plastic model  as you can see  using a rapid prototyping technique  another engineering technique. We then used that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh  which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta. So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best  really. Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant. Once you've made it  the installation is quite easy. John Pepper  bless his heart  professor of cardiothoracic surgery. Never done it before in his life  he put the first one in  didn't like it  he put the second one in. Happy  away I went. Four and a half hours on the table  and everything was done. So the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part. If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative  the composite aortic root graft  there are one or two startling comparisons which I'm sure will be clear to all of you. Two hours to install one of our devices  compared to   hours for the existing treatment. As I said  the existing treatment requires the heart lung bypass machine  and it requires a total body cooling. We don't need any of that. We work on a beating heart. He opens you up  he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating  all at the right temperature. No breaking into your circulatory system. So it really is great. But for me  absolutely the best point is  there is no anticoagulation therapy required. I don't take any drugs at all  other than recreational ones that I would choose to take. And in fact  if you speak to people who are on long term warfarin  it is a serious compromise to your quality of life  and even worse  it inevitably foreshortens your life. Likewise  if you have the artificial valve option  you're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment  even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics  in case you get an internal infection on the valve. Again  I don't have any of that  so I'm entirely free  my artery is fixed. I haven't got to worry about it  which is a rebirth for me. Back to the theme of the presentation  multidisciplinary research  how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life  Well  the answer to that is  a multidisciplinary team. This is a list of the core team  and you can see there aren't only two principal technical disciplines there  medicine and engineering  but also  there are various specialists from within those two disciplines. John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the actual work on me. But everyone else had to contribute one way or another. Raad Mohiaddin  a medical radiologist. We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model. Warren Thornton  who still does all our CAD models for us  had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set. There are some barriers to this  though  there are some problems. Jargon is a big one. I would think no one in this room understands the first four jargon points. The engineers amongst you will recognize  rapid prototyping  and  CAD.  The medics amongst you  if there are any  will recognize the first two  but there will be nobody else here that understands all those four words. Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used. Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well. We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me  produced those slices and used them to build a CAD model. And the very first CAD model we made  the surgeons were playing with it and couldn't quite figure it out. And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta. And it was a mirror image because in the real world  we always look down on plans  plans of houses  or streets  or maps. In the medical world  they look up at plans. So the horizontal images were all in inversion. So  one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions. Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not. Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project. The Brompton Hospital was taken over by the Imperial College School of Medicine. And there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations. I was working with the Imperial and the Brompton  and this generated some serious problems for the project. Really  problems that shouldn't exist. Research   Ethics Committee. If you want to do anything new in surgery  you have to get a license from your local Research   Ethics. I'm sure it's the same in Poland. There will be some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery. We didn't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that  we also had professional jealousies. There were people on the Research   Ethics committee who really didn't want to see John Pepper succeed again. Because he is so successful. And they made extra problems for us. Bureaucratic problems. Ultimately  when you have a new treatment  you have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country. In the UK  we have the National Institute and Clinical Excellence. You have an equivalent in Poland  no doubt. And we had to get past the NICE problem. We now have a great clinical guidance  out on the net. So any other hospitals interested can come along  read the NICE report  get in touch with us  and then get doing it themselves. Funding barriers  another big area to be concerned with. A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives. When we first approached one of the big  charitable UK organizations that fund this kind of stuff  we essentially gave them an engineering proposal. They didn't understand it  they were doctors  next to God  it must be rubbish  they binned it. So in the end  I went after private investors  just gave up on it. Most R D is going to be institutionally funded  by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council  or whatever. And you need to get past those people. Jargon is a huge problem when you try to work across disciplines  because in an engineering world  we all understand CAD and RP. Not in the medical world. I suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together. They've really got to start talking to each other  and exercise a bit of imagination  if that's not too much to ask. Which it probably is. I've coined the phrase  obstructive conservatism.  So many people in the medical world don't want to change. Particularly when some jumped up engineer has come along with the answer. They don't want to change. They simply want to do whatever they've done before. And in fact  many surgeons in the UK are still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of an episode  so that they could say   Told you that was no good.  We've actually got    patients. At seven and a half years  we've got    post op patient years between us  and we haven't had a single problem. And still  there are people in the UK saying   That external aortic root  it will never work  you know.  It really is a problem. I'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics  doctors  surgeons  at some point. The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves.  Well  of course  I'm looking after my patient.  I think it's not good  but that's my view. Egos  of course  again a huge problem. If you work in a multidisciplinary team  you've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt  you've got to express support for them. Tom Treasure  professor of cardiothoracic surgery. Incredible guy. Dead easy to give him respect. Him giving me respect  Slightly different. That's all the bad news. The good news is  the benefits are stonkingly huge. Translate that one  I bet they can't. When you have a group of people with different professional training  a different professional experience  they not only have a different knowledge base  but also a different perspective on everything. And if you can bring them together  and get them talking and understanding each other  the results can be spectacular. You can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before  very quickly and easily. You can short cut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have. And as a result  it's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you. The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets. I'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I'm not prepared to tell you what it cost  because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments  probably in the USA  which cost more for a one off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality. That's all I want to say  and I've got three minutes left. So  Ewa's going to like me. If you have any questions  please come up and talk to me later on  it would be a pleasure to speak with you. Many thanks. If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life  I would have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi  the Chinese equivalency exam  and I was going to go study law in Beijing  and I was going to improve U.S. China relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms. I had a plan  and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo. Little did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room. And it was Doc Watson singing and playing  Shady Grove.    Shady Grove  my little love     Shady Grove  my darlin'     Shady Grove  my little love     Going back to Harlan   That sound was just so beautiful  the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo. And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture  it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome. I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China. So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo  I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs  and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention. And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me. And they said   Hey  do you want to jam   And I was like   Sure.  So I picked up my banjo and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them. And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville  Tennessee to make a record. It's been eight years  and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer. In fact  I went to Nashville. And after a few months I was writing songs. And the first song I wrote was in English  and the second one was in Chinese.  Chinese  Outside your door the world is waiting. Inside your heart a voice is calling. The four corners of the world are watching  so travel daughter  travel. Go get it  girl. It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky. And I've played thousands of shows. And I've collaborated with so many incredible  inspirational musicians around the world. And I see the power of music. I see the power of music to connect cultures. I see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese.  Chinese  And everybody's eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads. And they're like   What's that girl doing   And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story. They all come up and they're like   You know  my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China and adopted a girl.  And I tell you what  it like everybody's got a story. It's just incredible. And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument  and she's singing their music. And I see  even more importantly  the power of music to connect hearts. Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone. And this little girl comes up to me.  Chinese   Big sister Wong   Washburn  Wong  same difference.  Big sister Wong  can I sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake   And I sat down  she sat on my lap. She started singing her song. And the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks  and I started to cry. And the light that shone off of her eyes was a place I could have stayed forever. And in that moment  we weren't our American selves  we weren't our Chinese selves  we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here. I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone. And I know U.S. China relations doesn't need another lawyer. Thank you. I got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee  as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything. So the natural question you ask then at that point is  how do I get good at what I'm trying to do  And it became a question of  how do we all get good at what we're trying to do  It's hard enough to learn to get the skills  try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you're taking on. I had to think about how I sew and how I cut  but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room. And then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good. In the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine's existence due to something you don't normally think about when you're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people  which is the cost of health care. There's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do. The political fight that we've developed has become one around whether it's the government that's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem. And the answer is yes and no  it's deeper than all of that. The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us. And in order to understand this  I'm going to take you back a couple of generations. I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book   The Youngest Science.  Lewis Thomas was a physician writer  one of my favorite writers. And he wrote this book to explain  among other things  what it was like to be a medical intern at the Boston City Hospital in the pre penicillin year of     . It was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective. If you were in a hospital  he said  it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth  some food  shelter  and maybe the caring attention of a nurse. Doctors and medicine made no difference at all. That didn't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days  as he explained. What they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could do something. And there were a few. You might have a lobar pneumonia  for example  and they could give you an antiserum  an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus  if the intern sub typed it correctly. If you had an acute congestive heart failure  they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein  giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent. If you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions  you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis  in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic    as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them. Beyond these sorts of things  a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do. This was when the core structure of medicine was created    what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be. It was at a time when what was known you could know  you could hold it all in your head  and you could do it all. If you had a prescription pad  if you had a nurse  if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce  maybe some basic tools  you really could do it all. You set the fracture  you drew the blood  you spun the blood  looked at it under the microscope  you plated the culture  you injected the antiserum. This was a life as a craftsman. As a result  we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring  at being courageous  at being independent and self sufficient. Autonomy was our highest value. Go a couple generations forward to where we are  though  and it looks like a completely different world. We have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have. We can't cure it all. We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life. But we can make it possible for most. But what does it take  Well  we've now discovered       medical and surgical procedures. We've discovered       drugs that I'm now licensed to prescribe. And we're trying to deploy this capability  town by town  to every person alive    in our own country  let alone around the world. And we've reached the point where we've realized  as doctors  we can't know it all. We can't do it all by ourselves. There was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital  as it changed over time. And in the year       it took just over two full time equivalents of clinicians. That is to say  it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day. By the end of the   th century  it had become more than    clinicians for the same typical hospital patient    specialists  physical therapists  the nurses. We're all specialists now  even the primary care physicians. Everyone just has a piece of the care. But holding onto that structure we built around the daring  independence  self sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster. We have trained  hired and rewarded people to be cowboys. But it's pit crews that we need  pit crews for patients. There's evidence all around us     percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care.    percent of our asthma  stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care. Two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene. Our experience as people who get sick  need help from other people  is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to    hardworking  incredibly well trained and very smart    that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope  but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way. There's another sign that we need pit crews  and that's the unmanageable cost of our care. Now we in medicine  I think  are baffled by this question of cost. We want to say   This is just the way it is. This is just what medicine requires.  When you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin  that mostly didn't do the job  to one where  if it gets bad enough  we can do a hip replacement  a knee replacement that gives you years  maybe decades  without disability  a dramatic change  well is it any surprise that that         hip replacement replacing the    cent aspirin is more expensive  It's just the way it is. But I think we're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do. As we've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased  we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care. And vice versa  the best care often turns out to be the least expensive    has fewer complications  the people get more efficient at what they do. And what that means is there's hope. Because  if  to have the best results  you really needed the most expensive care in the country  or in the world  well then we really would be talking about rationing who we're going to cut off from Medicare. That would be really our only choice. But when we look at the positive deviants    the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs    we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful. That is to say  they found ways to get all of the different pieces  all of the different components  to come together into a whole. Having great components is not enough  and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components. We want the best drugs  the best technologies  the best specialists  but we don't think too much about how it all comes together. It's a terrible design strategy actually. There's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said  what if you built a car from the very best car parts  Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes  a Ferrari engine  a Volvo body  a BMW chassis. And you put it all together and what do you get  A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere. And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes. It's not a system. Now a system  however  when things start to come together  you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way. Skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure. When you are a specialist  you can't see the end result very well. You have to become really interested in data  unsexy as that sounds. One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids  Iowa  and he got interested in the question of  well how many CT scans did they do for their community in Cedar Rapids  He got interested in this because there had been government reports  newspaper reports  journal articles saying that there had been too many CT scans done. He didn't see it in his own patients. And so he asked the question   How many did we do   and he wanted to get the data. It took him three months. No one had asked this question in his community before. And what he found was that  for the         people in their community  in the previous year they had done        CT scans. They had found a problem. Which brings us to skill number two a system has. Skill one  find where your failures are. Skill two is devise solutions. I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery. The volume of surgery had spread around the world  but the safety of surgery had not. Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training  give people more specialization or bring in more technology. Well in surgery  you couldn't have people who are more specialized and you couldn't have people who are better trained. And yet we see unconscionable levels of death  disability that could be avoided. And so we looked at what other high risk industries do. We looked at skyscraper construction  we looked at the aviation world  and we found that they have technology  they have training  and then they have one other thing  They have checklists. I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about checklists. And yet  what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better. We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us. Could we design a checklist for surgery  Not for the lowest people on the totem pole  but for the folks who were all the way around the chain  the entire team including the surgeons. And what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood. You have to think about things like pause points. You need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger and do something about it. You have to identify that this is a before takeoff checklist. And then you need to focus on the killer items. An aviation checklist  like this one for a single engine plane  isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane  it's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they're not checked. So we did this. We created a    item two minute checklist for surgical teams. We had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given  immediately before the knife hits the skin  immediately before the patient leaves the room. And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there    making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half    and then interesting stuff  because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery. Instead  you can make a recipe for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected. And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day  because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you're coming in. We implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world  deliberately in places from rural Tanzania to the University of Washington in Seattle. We found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell    percent. It fell in every hospital it went into. The death rates fell    percent. This was bigger than a drug. And that brings us to skill number three  the ability to implement this  to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things. And it's been slow to spread. This is not yet our norm in surgery    let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas. There's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we're not a system  forces us to behave with a different set of values. Just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had  like humility  discipline  teamwork. This is the opposite of what we were built on  independence  self sufficiency  autonomy. I met an actual cowboy  by the way. I asked him  what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles  How did you do that  And he said   We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around.  They communicate electronically constantly  and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything       from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle. Even the cowboys are pit crews now. And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves. Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists. But I would go further and say that making systems work  whether in health care  education  climate change  making a pathway out of poverty  is the great task of our generation as a whole. In every field  knowledge has exploded  but it has brought complexity  it has brought specialization. And we've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize  as individualistic as we want to be  complexity requires group success. We all need to be pit crews now. Thank you. Last January  my company  Fark.com  was sued along with Yahoo  MSN  Reddit  AOL  TechCrunch and others by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources. Gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email. Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented  but it does happen all the time. Take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology    like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones  and so on. The problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional  and as a result  most of these lawsuits end in settlements. And because these settlements are under a non disclosure agreement  no one knows what the terms were. And as a result  the patent troll can claim that they won the case. In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources  this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself  and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release  and it turns out that is press release    as in P.R. Now my company  Fark  deals with news  ostensibly  and as a result we were not in violation of this patent. So case closed  right  Wrong. One of the major problems with patent law is that  in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll  the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant  which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on. And this can take quite a while. You need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes    months when you win. That is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll. Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit  but one by one they settled out of the case  even though    and this is important    none of these companies infringed on this patent    not a one of them. And they started settling out. The reason they settled out is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit    clearly  two million dollars cheaper in some cases  and much worse if you actually lose. It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company  especially a small eight man shop like my company. Six months into the lawsuit  we finally reached the discovery phase. And in discovery phase  we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring. Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed  but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle. Their attorney   Ah  yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end.  Never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A. with no employees.  And we'd like to go ahead and close this out. So would you mind giving us your best and final offer   My response   How about nothing    We didn't have high hopes for that outcome. But they settled. No counter offer. Now  as mentioned before  one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there's no non disclosure agreement on this case. Now how did that happen  Well during the settlement process  when we received our copy  I struck it. My attorney said   Nah  no chance of that working.  It came back signed. Now why  You can call them. They're not under NDA either. Now what did I learn from this case  Well  three things. First of all  if you can  don't fight the patent  fight the infringement. Patents are very difficult to overturn. Infringement is a lot easier to disprove. Secondly  make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money. Now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements. If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money  they become less interested in pursuing the case. Finally  make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them. Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way. It turns out  because they're paid on contingency  it works really  really well in reverse. Don't forget that. So what does all this mean  Well to sum up  it boils down to one thing  Don't negotiate with terrorists. Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year. And what do they do with that money  They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits. Now this is the point in the Talk where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system. And the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system. The health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors. The hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers. And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed  but they are at odds. And as a result  patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between. So unfortunately I'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem. However  I did have this idea  and it was kind of good. And I thought   I should patent this.  Behold  patent infringement via mobile device    defined as a computer which is not stationary. My solution  award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence. Thank you. This is Shivdutt Yadav  and he's from Uttar Pradesh  India. Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in Uttar Pradesh  and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead. His land was no longer registered in his name. His brothers  Chandrabhan and Phoolchand  were also listed as dead. Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead  allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland. Because of this  all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home. According to the Yadav family  the local court has been scheduling a case review since       but a judge has never appeared. There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review. Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property led to this corruption. He was laid to rest in the Ganges River  where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water. Photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don't exist  and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life. Yet  these men remain dead. This quandary led to the title of the project  which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future. So this story is the first of    chapters in my new body of work titled  A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters.  And for this work  I traveled around the world over a four year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories. I was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood  chance or circumstance. The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in India. In each chapter  you can see the external forces of governance  power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance. Each work that I make is comprised of three segments. On the left are one or more portrait panels in which I systematically order the members of a given bloodline. This is followed by a text panel  it's designed in scroll form  in which I construct the narrative at stake. And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel. It's a space that's more intuitive in which I present fragments of the story  beginnings of other stories  photographic evidence. And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet  in a less linear form. So it's more disordered. And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline. In my past projects I've often worked in serial form  documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation  but in fact  are fairly abstract. In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog  something that I couldn't interrupt  curate or edit by choice. This led me to blood. A bloodline is determined and ordered. But the project centers on the collision of order and disorder    the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters. In chapter two  I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin. He was sent in      to Palestine by the Zionist organization to look at areas for Jewish settlement and acquire land for Jewish settlement. He oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company whose work led to the establishment of a Jewish state. Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem  I wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the Jewish state. And I found these maps which you see here. And these are studies commissioned by the Zionist organization for alternative areas for Jewish settlement. In this  I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda  which is what these maps demonstrate. These archives in Jerusalem  they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to Palestine  and later Israel  from      to     . Chapter three  Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo treated patients outside of Kisumu  Kenya for AIDS  tuberculosis  infertility  mental illness  evil spirits. He's most often paid for his services in cash  cows or goats. But sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services  their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment. As a result of these transactions  Jura has nine wives     children and    grandchildren. In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here. Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them  three for evil spirits  one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love  paying their families a total of    cows. One wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits. Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya. It's common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes. Instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth  status and power. You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed there are empty portraits. These empty portraits represent individuals  living individuals  who couldn't be present. And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel. They include dengue fever  imprisonment  army service  women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons. And in this particular chapter  it's children whose mothers wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it. Twenty four European rabbits were brought to Australia in      by a British settler for sporting purposes  for hunting. And within a hundred years  that population of    had exploded to half a billion. The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia  and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land. Since the     s  Australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth. These rabbits were bred at a government facility  Biosecurity Queensland  where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them. So they're testing its virulence. During the course of this trial  all of the rabbits died  except for a few  which were euthanized. Haigh's Chocolate  in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit Free Australia  stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby. Now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that's native to Australia  and actually an animal that is threatened by the European rabbit. In chapter seven  I focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline. So over a two day period  six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. This is the only work in which I visually represent the dead. But I only represent those that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre  which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War. And during this massacre        Bosnian Muslim men and boys were systematically executed. So when you look at a detail of this work  you can see  the man on the upper left is the father of the woman sitting next to him. Her name is Zumra. She is followed by her four children  all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre. Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well. During the time I was in Bosnia  the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave. And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains. However  the other individuals are represented by these blue slides  which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals. They've all been given a proper burial  so what remains are these blue slides at the International Commission for Missing Persons. These are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory  which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying  and also the Serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions. This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial  which from top to bottom shows a Serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an Orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them. Chapter    is more of a performance piece. I solicited China's State Council Information Office in      to select a multi generational bloodline to represent China for this project. They chose a large family from Beijing for its size  and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice. This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits. Everyone showed up. You can also see the evolution of the one child only policy as it travels through the bloodline. Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda  the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations. It controls all foreign media and image production outside of China from foreign media working within China. It also monitors the Internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues  including Tibet  ethnic minorities  Human Rights  religion  democracy movements and terrorism. For the footnote panel in this work  this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in Beijing. And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me when I left. These are the descendants of Hans Frank who was Hitler's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied Poland. Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits  highlighting a complex relationship to one's family history. The reasons for these absences include people who declined participation. There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves. Another section of the family presented their clothing  as opposed to their physical presence  because they didn't want to be identified with the past that I was highlighting. And finally  another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation  so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable. In the footnote panel that accompanies this work I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by British Intelligence with Hans Frank's image on it. It was released in Poland to create friction between Frank and Hitler  so that Hitler would imagine Frank was trying to usurp his power. Again  talking about fate  I was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art. These paintings were taken by Hans Frank during the time of the Third Reich. And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time. They are Leonardo da Vinci's  Lady With an Ermine   Rembrandt's  Landscape With Good Samaritan  and Raphael's  Portrait of a Youth   which has never been found. Chapter    highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making  but becomes their own. So this is the Ferraz family and the Novaes family. And they are in an active blood feud. This feud has been going on since      in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco  and it involved the deaths of    members of the families and    others associated with the feud  including hired hit men  innocent bystanders and friends. Tensions between these two families date back to      when there was a dispute over local political power. But it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors. Installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes  who's the head of the Novaes family  are these turret holes  which were used for shooting and looking. Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation's most violent regions. It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice  or an eye for an eye  so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area. This story  like many of the stories in my chapters  reads almost as an archetypal episode  like something out of Shakespeare  that's happening now and will happen again in the future. I'm interested in these ideas of repetition. So after I returned home  I received word that one member of the family had been shot    times in the face. Chapter    is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history. Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and   . This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood. In a    month period when I was at the orphanage  only one child had been adopted. Children have to leave the orphanage at age     despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go. It's commonly reported in Ukraine that children  when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking  child pornography and prostitution. Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival  and high rates of suicide are recorded. This is a boys' bedroom. There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing. Children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn't turned on until October. This is a girls' bedroom. And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer  four vacuum cleaners  two computers  a video projector  a copy machine  winter shoes and a dentist's drill. This photograph  which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms  shows a sign which I had translated when I got home. And it reads   Those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future.  There are many more chapters in this project. This is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images. And this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive. And within this accumulation of images and texts  I'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself. But archives exist because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated. Something is said in the gaps between all the information that's collected. And there's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between. It's almost machine like the way people are born and people die  and the stories keep coming and coming. And in this  I'm considering  is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution  or are we on repeat over and over again  Thank you. People are living longer and societies are getting grayer. You hear about it all the time. You read about it in your newspapers. You hear about it on your television sets. Sometimes I'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency  even ease. But make no mistake  longer lives can and  I believe  will improve quality of life at all ages. Now to put this in perspective  let me just zoom out for a minute. More years were added to average life expectancy in the   th century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined. In the blink of an eye  we nearly doubled the length of time that we're living. So if you ever feel like you don't have this aging thing quite pegged  don't kick yourself. It's brand new. And because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up  that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population  with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle. And now  if you're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics  these are the ones that should do it. Because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species  the majority of babies born in the Developed World are having the opportunity to grow old. How did this happen  Well we're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were        years ago. This increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture    the crucible that holds science and technology and wide scale changes in behavior that improve health and well being. Through cultural changes  our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives. Now there are problems associated with aging    diseases  poverty  loss of social status. It's hardly time to rest on our laurels. But the more we learn about aging  the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate. Aging brings some rather remarkable improvements    increased knowledge  expertise    and emotional aspects of life improve. That's right  older people are happy. They're happier than middle aged people  and younger people certainly. Study after study is coming to the same conclusion. The CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week. And fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question than middle aged people  and younger people as well. And a recent Gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day. And stress  worry  anger all decrease with age. Now social scientists call this the paradox of aging. After all  aging is not a piece of cake. So we've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding. We've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations. That is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older. We've asked  well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence. But the more we've tried to disavow this finding  the more evidence we find to support it. Years ago  my colleagues and I embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a    year period. Originally the sample was aged    to   . And we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older. Our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time  and we'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times. And every time we paged them we'd ask them to answer several questions    On a one to seven scale  how happy are you right now  How sad are you right now  How frustrated are you right now     so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day to day lives. And using this intense study of individuals  we find that it's not one particular generation that's doing better than the others  but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience. Now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages. And there is a slight downturn. But at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood. Now it's really too simplistic to say that older people are  happy.  In our study  they are more positive  but they're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions    sadness at the same time you experience happiness  you know  that tear in the eye when you're smiling at a friend. And other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably. They're more accepting of sadness than younger people are. And we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than younger people at solving hotly charged emotional conflicts and debates. Older people can view injustice with compassion  but not despair. And all things being equal  older people direct their cognitive resources  like attention and memory  to positive information more than negative. If we show older  middle aged  younger people images  like the ones you see on the screen  and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can  older people  but not younger people  remember more positive images than negative images. We've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies  some frowning  some smiling. Older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning  angry faces. In day to day life  this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction. But as social scientists  we continue to ask about possible alternatives. We've said  well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're cognitively impaired. We've said  could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions  and so you switch to the positive emotions  Maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we're unable to process negative emotions anymore. But that's not the case. The most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most. And under conditions where it really matters  older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information. So how can this be  Well in our research  we've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time    not just clock time and calendar time  but lifetime. And if there's a paradox of aging  it's that recognizing that we won't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways. When time horizons are long and nebulous  as they typically are in youth  people are constantly preparing  trying to soak up all the information they possibly can  taking risks  exploring. We might spend time with people we don't even like because it's somehow interesting. We might learn something unexpected. We go on blind dates. You know  after all  if it doesn't work out  there's always tomorrow. People over    don't go on blind dates. As we age  our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change. When we recognize that we don't have all the time in the world  we see our priorities most clearly. We take less notice of trivial matters. We savor life. We're more appreciative  more open to reconciliation. We invest in more emotionally important parts of life  and life gets better  so we're happier day to day. But that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice. By       there will be more people in the United States over the age of    than under   . What will happen to societies that are top heavy with older people  The numbers won't determine the outcome. Culture will. If we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people  then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages. Societies with millions of talented  emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them  armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues can be better societies than we have ever known. My father  who is     likes to say   Let's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all.  Thank you. Have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque  Probably not  but people like me do. I'm an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich  and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans. And through this work  I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies  so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future. There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine  and one way is to extract human DNA from ancient bones. And from these extracts  we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations  risk factors and inherited diseases. But this is only one half of the story. The most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome  but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation  diet  microbes and parasites and our immune response. All of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved. And in order to understand these diseases  we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past. But there are a lot of challenges for this. And first of all  what do we even study  Skeletons are ubiquitous  they're found all over the place. But of course  all of the soft tissue has decomposed  and the skeleton itself has limited health information. Mummies are a great source of information  except that they're really geographically limited and limited in time as well. Coprolites are fossilized human feces  and they're actually extremely interesting. You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease  but they are very rare. So to address this problem  I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland  Denmark and the U.K. to study a very poorly studied  little known material that's found on people everywhere. It's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus. Many of you may know it by the term tartar. It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit. And in a typical dentistry visit  you may have about    to    milligrams removed. But in ancient times before tooth brushing  up to     milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime. And what's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton  it's abundant in quantity before the present day and it's ubiquitous worldwide. We find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years. And we even find it in neanderthals and animals. And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy. They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope  and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches  and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria. And so what my team of researchers  what we wanted to do  is say  can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins  and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what's going on  And what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth. We also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet. But what was surprising to us  and also quite exciting  is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems. So it gives us virtual access to the lungs  which is where many important diseases reside. And we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut. And so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that  from the skeleton alone  has long decomposed. And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus  we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet  infection and immunity thousands of years ago. So what started out as an idea  is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long term evolutionary history of human health and disease  right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens. And from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick. And I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus. And as a final parting thought  on behalf of future archeologists  I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth. Thank you. A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever. And today  after briefly describing what they found  I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery  namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth  the Milky Way and other distant galaxies  we may find that our universe is not the only universe  but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one. I mean  most of us were raised to believe that the word  universe  means everything. And I say most of us with forethought  as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born. And last year I was holding her and I said   Sophia  I love you more than anything in the universe.  And she turned to me and said   Daddy  universe or multiverse   But barring such an anomalous upbringing  it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours  most with fundamentally different features  that would rightly be called universes of their own. And yet  speculative though the idea surely is  I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously  as it just might be right. I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts. In part one  I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed. In part two  I'll offer a solution to that mystery. It's based on an approach called string theory  and that's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story. Finally  in part three  I'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation  which will pull all the pieces of the story together. Okay  part one starts back in      when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us  establishing that space itself is stretching  it's expanding. Now this was revolutionary. The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static. But even so  there was one thing that everyone was certain of  The expansion must be slowing down. That  much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward  the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space. Now let's fast forward to the     s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing. And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies  allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here's the surprise  They found that the expansion is not slowing down. Instead they found that it's speeding up  going faster and faster. That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster. Now if you saw an apple do that  you'd want to know why. What's pushing on it  Similarly  the astronomers' results are surely well deserving of the Nobel Prize  but they raised an analogous question. What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed  Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein's. You see  we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing  pulls objects together. But in Einstein's theory of gravity  his general theory of relativity  gravity can also push things apart. How  Well according to Einstein's math  if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy  sort of like a uniform  invisible mist  then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive  repulsive gravity  which is just what we need to explain the observations. Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space    we now call it dark energy  but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it    its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other  driving expansion to speed up  not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here in part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up  look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed in the relevant unit  it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics  but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder  should you care  Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue  a technical detail of interest to experts  but of no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail  but some details really matter. Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality  and this peculiar number may be doing just that  as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes    an idea that naturally emerges from string theory  which takes me to part two  string theory. So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory. First off  what is it  Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics  a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe. And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely  at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller  much smaller than we can with existing technology  you'd find something else inside these particles    a little tiny vibrating filament of energy  a little tiny vibrating string. And just like the strings on a violin  they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes. These little fundamental strings  when they vibrate in different patterns  they produce different kinds of particles    so electrons  quarks  neutrinos  photons  all other particles would be united into a single framework  as they would all arise from vibrating strings. It's a compelling picture  a kind of cosmic symphony  where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little  tiny strings can play. But there's a cost to this elegant unification  because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work. It has internal inconsistencies  unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar    extra dimensions of space. That is  we all know about the usual three dimensions of space. And you can think about those as height  width and depth. But string theory says that  on fantastically small scales  there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden  they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate. And in string theory  vibration determines everything. So particle masses  the strengths of forces  and most importantly  the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions  we should be able to calculate these features  calculate the amount of dark energy. The challenge is we don't know the shape of the extra dimensions. All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed  there were only about five different candidate shapes  so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes. From five  the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands    A large  but still manageable  collection to analyze  since after all  graduate students need something to do. But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions  until today. The list of candidate shapes has soared to about    to the    . So  what to do  Well some researchers lost heart  concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions  each giving rise to different physical features  string theory would never make definitive  testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head  taking us to the possibility of a multiverse. Here's the idea. Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other. Each is as real as every other  in the sense that there are many universes  each with a different shape  for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery  the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize winning results. Because you see  if there are other universes  and if those universes each have  say  a different shape for the extra dimensions  then the physical features of each universe will be different  and in particular  the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context  the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn't just one number  there are many numbers. Which means we have been asking the wrong question. It's that the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there  And that's a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours  whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies  the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don't form. And in those universes that have much less dark energy  well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that  again  galaxies don't form. And without galaxies  there are no stars  no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes. So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life. And that would be that. Mystery solved  multiverse found. Now some find this explanation unsatisfying. We're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe. But the point is  if the feature you're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality  then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number    why the Sun is    million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades trying to explain this number  but he never succeeded  and we know why. Kepler was asking the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars. So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number     million miles  well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is  why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance  instead of any of the other possibilities  And again  that's a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn't exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star  well they're so cold that  again  our form of life would not take hold. So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life. And when it comes to planets and their distances  this clearly is the right kind of reasoning. The point is  when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain  it may also be the right kind of reasoning. One key difference  of course  is we know that there are other planets out there  but so far I've only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together  we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my final part  part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang. You see  when we speak of the Big Bang  we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward. But there's a little secret. The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important  the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang  but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory. It's called inflationary cosmology  which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space. The fuel is based on something called a quantum field  but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up  which means in the inflationary theory  the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event. Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang  but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs  each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes. And now  when we meld this with string theory  here's the picture we're led to. Each of these universes has extra dimensions. The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes. The different shapes yield different physical features. And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it's only in our universe that the physical features  like the amount of dark energy  are right for our form of life to take hold. And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remaining question  of course  is  could we ever confirm the existence of other universes  Well let me describe one way that might one day happen. The inflationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded  tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world  yielding a distinctive fingerprint  a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots  across space  which powerful telescopes have now observed. Going further  if there are other universes  the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another  that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is  it may one day be grounded in observations  establishing the existence of other universes. I'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future. You see  we learned that our universe is not static  that space is expanding  that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speeding up  in the very far future  those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them    not because of technological limitations  but because of the laws of physics. The light those galaxies emit  even traveling at the fastest speed  the speed of light  will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us. So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static  inky  black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit    a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era  like ours  attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge  Or would they believe in the black  static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal  I suspect the latter. Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today's astronomers  by turning powerful telescopes to the sky  have captured a handful of starkly informative photons    a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. and the message echoing across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Brian  thank you. The range of ideas you've just spoken about are dizzying  exhilarating  incredible. How do you think of where cosmology is now  in a sort of historical side  Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion  BG  Well it's hard to say. When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out  the natural question is  maybe we're already in that position and certain deep  critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective  maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them. On the other hand  we now can understand how old the universe is. We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down   .   billion years ago    and yet  we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches. Holy cow  That's just amazing. So on the one hand  it's just incredible where we've gotten  but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future. CA  You're going to be around for the next few days. Maybe some of these conversations can continue. Thank you. Thank you  Brian.  BG  My pleasure.  So I want to talk today about money and happiness  which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about  either trying to earn them or trying to increase them. And a lot of us resonate with this phrase. So we see it in religions and self help books  that money can't buy happiness. And I want to suggest today that  in fact  that's wrong. I'm at a business school  so that's what we do. So that's wrong  and  in fact  if you think that  you're actually just not spending it right. So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it  maybe if you spent it differently  that might work a little bit better. And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier  let's think about the ways we usually spend it that don't  in fact  make us happier. We had a little natural experiment. So CNN  a little while ago  wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery. It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing. This article's about how their lives get ruined. So what happens when people win the lottery is  number one  they spend all the money and go into debt  and number two  all of their friends and everyone they've ever met find them and bug them for money. And it ruins their social relationships  in fact. So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery. What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article  readers of the thing. And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness  everyone instantly started saying   You know what I would do if I won the lottery ...    and fantasizing about what they'd do. And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about. One person wrote in   When I win  I'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top.  And another person wrote   I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne.  This is even worse now   Then I'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made. Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else.  And so many of the comments were exactly of this type  where people got money and  in fact  it made them antisocial. So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them. It also  money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves. Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy is that we're always spending it on the wrong things  and in particular  that we're always spending it on ourselves. And we thought  I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people. So instead of being antisocial with your money  what if you were a little more prosocial with your money  And we thought  let's make people do it and see what happens. So let's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves  and let's make some people give money away  and measure their happiness and see if  in fact  they get happier. So the first way that we did this. On one Vancouver morning  we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said   Do you want to be in an experiment   They said   Yes.  We asked them how happy they were  and then we gave them an envelope. And one of the envelopes had things in it that said   By      pm today  spend this money on yourself.  So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on. Other people  in the morning  got a slip of paper that said   By      pm today  spend this money on somebody else.  Also inside the envelope was money. And we manipulated how much money we gave them. So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars. Some people got this slip of paper and    dollars. We let them go about their day. They did whatever they wanted to do. We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to. We called them up at night and asked them   What'd you spend it on  and how happy do you feel now   What did they spend it on  Well these are college undergrads  so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup. One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece. People gave money to homeless people. Huge effect here of Starbucks. So if you give undergraduates five dollars  it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can. But some people bought a coffee for themselves  the way they usually would  but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else. So the very same purchase  just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else. What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day  People who spent money on other people got happier. People who spent money on themselves  nothing happened. It didn't make them less happy  it just didn't do much for them. And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much. So people thought that    dollars would be way better than five dollars. In fact  it doesn't matter how much money you spent. What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself. We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves. Of course  these are undergraduates in Canada    not the world's most representative population. They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things. We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries. So we went  in fact  to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment. So imagine  instead of just people in Canada  we said   Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people. Describe it. How happy did it make you   Or in Uganda   Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that.  And then we asked them how happy they are again. And what we see is sort of amazing because there's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well. So for example  one guy from Uganda says this. He said   I called a girl I wished to love.  They basically went out on a date  and he says at the end that he didn't  achieve  her up till now. Here's a guy from Canada. Very similar thing.  I took my girlfriend out for dinner. We went to a movie  we left early  and then went back to her room for ...   only cake    just a piece of cake. Human universal    so you spend money on other people  you're being nice to them. Maybe you have something in mind  maybe not. But then we see extraordinary differences. So look at these two. This is a woman from Canada. We say   Name a time you spent money on somebody else.  She says   I bought a present for my mom. I drove to the mall in my car  bought a present  gave it to my mom.  Perfectly nice thing to do. It's good to get gifts for people that you know. Compare that to this woman from Uganda.  I was walking and met a long time friend whose son was sick with malaria. They had no money  they went to a clinic and I gave her this money.  This isn't          it's the local currency. So it's a very small amount of money  in fact. But enormously different motivations here. This is a real medical need  literally a life saving donation. Above  it's just kind of  I bought a gift for my mother. What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy  which is really quite important. So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy. You can do small  trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this. These are only two countries. We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness. We got data from the Gallup Organization  which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately. They ask people   Did you donate money to charity recently   and they ask them   How happy are you with your life in general   And we can see what the relationship is between those two things. Are they positively correlated  Giving money makes you happy. Or are they negatively correlated  On this map  green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated. And you can see  the world is crazily green. So in almost every country in the world where we have this data  people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don't give money to charity. I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle. I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is  but in fact  it's Central African Republic. You can make up stories. Maybe it's different there for some reason or another. Just below that to the right is Rwanda though  which is amazingly green. So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself. What about your work life  which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know. We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing. So these are sales teams in Belgium. They work in teams  they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs. So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team. Some teams  we give people on the team some money for themselves and say   Spend it however you want on yourself   just like we did with the undergrads in Canada. But other teams we say   Here's    euro. Spend it on one of your teammates this week. Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them. And then we can see  well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better. The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata  and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that. A very silly  trivial thing to do  but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all  that got    euro  put it in their pocket  maybe bought themselves a coffee  or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity. What we see is that  in fact  the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves. And one way to think about it is for every    euro you give people for themselves  they put it in their pocket  they don't do anything different than they did before. You don't get any money from that. You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better. But when you give them    euro to spend on their teammates  they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money. And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves  this is all fine  but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there. And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here  I don't believe anything he said. And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams. This was a huge criticism that we got to say  if you can't show it with dodgeball teams  this is all stupid. So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them. And we did the exact same thing as before. So some teams  we give people on the team money  they spend it on themselves. Other teams  we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates. The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before. The teams that we give the money to spend on each other  they become different teams and  in fact  they dominate the league by the time they're done. Across all of these different contexts    your personal life  you work life  even silly things like intramural sports    we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself. And so I'll just say  I think if you think money can't buy happiness you're not spending it right. The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier. It's in fact  that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead. And we luckily have an opportunity for you. DonorsChoose.org is a non profit for mainly public school teachers in low income schools. They post projects  so they say   I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books   or  I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope.  You and I can go on and buy it for them. The teacher writes you a thank you note. The kids write you a thank you note. Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope. It's an extraordinary thing. Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking  again  less about  How can I spend money on myself   and more about  If I've got five dollars or    dollars  what can I do to benefit other people   Because ultimately when you do that  you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more. Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. It's a great honor to be here talking about cities  talking about the future of cities. It's great to be here as a mayor. I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives. That's the place to be. And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio. Rio's a beautiful city  a vibrant place  special place. Actually  you're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world. And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio. the envelope containing the result. Jacques Rogge  I have the honor to announce that the games of the   st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro. EP  Okay  that's very touching  very emotional  but it was not easy to get there. Actually it was a very hard challenge. We had to beat the European monarchy. This is Juan Carlos  king of Spain. We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology. We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city. So it was not easy at all. And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that I think fits perfectly to the situation of Rio winning the Olympic bid. We really showed that  yes  we can. And really  this is the reason I came here tonight. I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done  that you don't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way  that cities are a great challenge. It's a difficult task to deal with cities. But with some original ways of getting things done  with some basic commandments  you can really get cities to be a great  great place to live. I want you all to imagine Rio. You probably think about a city full of energy  a vibrant city full of green. And nobody showed that better than Carlos Saldanha in last year's  Rio.  EP  Okay  some parts of Rio are pretty much like that  but it's not like that everywhere. We're like every big city in the world. We've got lots of people  pollution  cars  concrete  lots of concrete. These pictures I'm showing here  they are some pictures from Madureira. It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio. And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira  in this region  to see what we should think as our first commandment. So every time you see a concrete jungle like that  what you've got to do is find open spaces. If you don't have open spaces  you've got to go there and open spaces. So go inside these open spaces and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces. This is going to be the third largest park in Rio by June this year. It's going to be a place where people can meet  where you can put nature. The temperature's going to drop two  three degrees centigrade. So the first commandment I want to leave you tonight is  a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly. Every time you think of a city  you've got to think green. You've got to think green and green. So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you. Let's think that cities are made of people  lots of people together. cities are packed with people. So how do you move these people around  When you have  .  billion people living in cities    by       it's going to be   billion people. So every time you think about moving these people around  you think about high capacity transportation. But there is a problem. High capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money. So what I'm going to show here is something that was already presented in TED by the former mayor of Curitiba who created that  a city in Brazil  Jaime Lerner. And it's something that we're doing  again  lots in Rio. It's the BRT  the Bus Rapid Transit. So you get a bus. It's a simple bus that everybody knows. You transform it inside as a train car. You use separate lanes  dedicated lanes. The contractors  they don't like that. You don't have to dig deep down underground. You can build nice stations. This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio. Again  you don't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that. This station has the same comfort  the same features as a subway station. A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway. So spending much less money and doing it much faster  you can really change the way people move. This is a map of Rio. All the lines  the colored lines you see there  it's our high capacity transportation network. In this present time today  we only carry    percent of our population in high capacity transportation. With the BRTs we're doing  again  the cheapest and fastest way  we're going to move to    percent of the population being carried by high capacity transportation. So remember what I said  You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done. You can find original ways to get things done. So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight is  a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people. Moving to the third commandment. And this is the most controversial one. It has to do with the favelas  the slums    whatever you call it  there are different names all over the world. But the point we want to make here tonight is  favelas are not always a problem. I mean  favelas can sometimes really be a solution  if you deal with them  if you put public policy inside the favelas. Let me just show a map of Rio again. Rio has  .  million inhabitants    More than    percent   .  million  live in the favelas. All these red parts are favelas. So you see  they are spread all over the city. This is a typical view of a favela in Rio. You see the contrast between the rich and poor. So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas. The first one is  you can change from what I call a  vicious  circle to a virtual circle. But what you've got to do to get that is you've got to go inside the favelas  bring in the basic services    mainly education and health    with high quality. I'm going to give a fast example here. This was an old building in a favela in Rio     unclear favela name     that we just transformed into a primary school  with high quality. This is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela  again  with high quality. We call it a family clinic. So the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality. The second point I want to make about the favelas is  you've got to open spaces in the favela. Bring infrastructure to the favelas  to the slums  wherever you are. Rio has the aim  by       to have all its favelas completely urbanized. Another example  this was completely packed with houses  and then we built this  what we call  a knowledge square. This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology. We even built a theater there     D movie. And this is the kind of change you can get for that. And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize  which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela. So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is  a city of the future has to be socially integrated. You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated. But moving to our fourth commandment  I really wouldn't be here tonight. Between November and May  Rio's completely packed. We just had last week Carnivale. It was great. It was lots of fun. We have New Year's Eve. There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach. We have problems. We fight floods  tropical rains at this time of the year. You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes. We have problems with the tropical rains. Almost every year we have these landslides  which are terrible. But the reason I could come here is because of that. This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old. It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio. And I wanted to show that I can govern my city  using technology  from here  from Long Beach  so I got here last night and I know everything. We're going to speak now to the Operations Center. This is Osorio  he's our secretary of urban affairs. So Osorio  good to be there with you. I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year. So how's the weather in Rio now  Osorio  The weather is fine. We have fair weather today. Let me get you our weather satellite radar. You see just a little bit of moisture around the city. Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather  today and in the next few days. EP  Okay  how's the traffic  We  at this time of year  get lots of traffic jams. People get mad at the mayor. So how's the traffic tonight  Osario  Well traffic tonight is fine. Let me get you one of our       buses. A live transmission in downtown Rio for you  Mr. Mayor. You see  the streets are clear. Now it's       pm in Rio. Nothing of concern in terms of traffic. I'll get to you now the incidents of the day. We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon  but nothing of big concern. We are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city. EP  Okay  so you're showing now some public services. These are the cars. Osorio  Absolutely  Mr. Mayor. Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks. This is live transmission. We have GPS's in all of our trucks. And you can see them working in all parts of the city. Waste collection on time. Public services working well. EP  Okay  Osorio  thank you very much. It was great to have you here. We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion. Okay  so no files  this place  no paperwork  no distance       working. So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight is  a city of the future has to use technology to be present. I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city. But everything that I said here tonight  or the commandments  are means  are ways  for us to govern cities    invest in infrastructure  invest in the green  open parks  open spaces  integrate socially  use technology. But at the end of the day  when we talk about cities  we talk about a gathering of people. And we cannot see that as a problem. That is fantastic. If there's  .  billion now  it's going to be six billion then it's going to be    billion. That is great  that means we're going to have    billion minds working together     billion talents together. So a city of the future  I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens  integrates socially its citizens. A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party  which are cities. Thank you very much. To most of you  this is a device to buy  sell  play games  watch videos. I think it might be a lifeline. I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin. Texting  I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting  a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see    hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else    or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL  LMAO  HMU. I can help you with those later. But the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids. It might be the only way to communicate with your kids. The average teenager sends       text messages a month  unless she's a girl  then it's closer to      . And the secret is she opens every single one. Texting has a     percent open rate. Now the parents are really alarmed. It's a     percent open rate even if she doesn't respond to you when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner. I promise she read that text. And this isn't some suburban iPhone using teen phenomenon. Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth. I know this because at DoSomething.org  which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in America  about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging. We're now texting out to about         kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that. We're finding it    times more powerful than email. We've also found an unintended consequence. We've been getting text messages back like these.  I don't want to go to school today. The boys call me faggot.   I was cutting  my parents found out  and so I stopped. But I just started again an hour ago.  Or   He won't stop raping me. He told me not to tell anyone. It's my dad. Are you there   That last one's an actual text message that we received. And yeah  we're there. I will not forget the day we got that text message. And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline. Because this isn't what we do. We do social change. Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there's nowhere else to turn that they're sending them to us. So think about it  a text hotline  it's pretty powerful. It's fast  it's pretty private. No one hears you in a stall  you're just texting quietly. It's real time. We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals. That's great. But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data. Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals. I want to prevent this shit from happening. So think about a cop. There's something in New York City. The police did it. It used to be just guess work  police work. And then they started crime mapping. And so they started following and watching petty thefts  summonses  all kinds of things    charting the future essentially. And they found things like  when you see crystal meth on the street  if you add police presence  you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen. In fact  the year after the NYPD put CompStat in place  the murder rate fell    percent. So think about the data from a crisis text line. There is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape    no census. Maybe there's some studies  some longitudinal studies  that cost lots of money and took lots of time. Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence. Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues. You could inform legislation. You could inform school policy. You could say to a principal   You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock. What's going on in your school   You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result. This is really  to me  the power of texting and the power of data. Because while people are talking about data  making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade  or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers  or some dude to build a better baseball team  I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school  to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her. Thank you. Five hundred seventy one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by Americans every year. If we could    correction  wrong figure       billion used every year. If we could reduce the usage of paper towels  one paper towel per person per day              pounds of paper not used. We can do that. Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers. There's the tri fold. People typically take two or three. There's the one that cuts it  that you have to tear off. People go one  two  three  four  tear. This much  right  There's the one that cuts itself. People go  one  two  three  four. Or there's the same thing  but recycled paper  you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbant  of course. The fact is  you can do it all with one towel. The key  two words  This half of the room  your word is  shake.  Let's hear it. Shake. Louder. Audience  Shake. Joe Smith  Your word is  fold.  Audience  Fold. JS  Again. Audience  Fold. JS  Really loud. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Okay. Wet hands. Shake    one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine            . Why     Twelve apostles  twelve tribes  twelve zodiac signs  twelve months. The one I like the best  It's the biggest number with one syllable. Tri fold. Fold ... Dry. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension. You don't have to remember that part  but trust me. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Cuts itself. You know the funny thing is  I get my hands drier than people do with three or four  because they can't get in between the cracks. If you think this isn't as good... Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Now  there's now a real fancy invention  it's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out. It's way too big a towel. Let me tell you a secret. If you're really quick  if you're really quick    and I can prove this    this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building. How  As soon as it starts  you just tear it off. It's smart enough to stop. And you get half a towel. Audience  Shake. Fold. JS  Now  let's all say it together. Shake. Fold. You will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel. And remember  one towel per person for one year                pounds of paper. No small thing. And next year  toilet paper. When we think of games  there's all kinds of things. Maybe you're ticked off  or maybe you're looking forward to a new game. You've been up too late playing a game. All these things happen to me. But when we think about games  a lot of times we think about stuff like this  first person shooters  or the big  what we would call AAA games  or maybe you're a Facebook game player. This is one my partner and I worked on. Maybe you play Facebook games  and that's what we're making right now. This is a lighter form of game. Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations. This would be one of those tragically boring board games that you can figure out. Or maybe you're in your living room  you know  playing with the Wii with the kids  or something like that  and  you know  there's this whole range of games  and that's very much what I think about. I make my living from games. I've been lucky enough to do this since I was     which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job. But we think about games as fun  and that's completely reasonable  but let's just think about this. So this one here  this is the      Olympics. Now I don't know where you guys were  but I was in my living room. It was practically a religious event. And this is when the Americans beat the Russians  and this was    yes  it was technically a game. Hockey is a game. But really  was this a game  I mean  people cried. I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly. And so this was just an amazing experience. Or  you know  if anybody here is from Boston    So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after  I believe      years  when they won the World Series  it was amazing. I happened to be living in Springfield at the time  and the best part of it was    is that    you would close the women's door in the bathroom  and I remember seeing  Go Sox   and I thought  really  Or the houses  you'd come out  because every game  well  I think almost every game  went into overtime  right  So we'd be outside  and all the other lights are on on the whole block  and kids  like  the attendance was down in school  and kids weren't going to school. But it's okay  it's the Red Sox  right  I mean  there's education  and then there's the Red Sox  and we know where they're stacked. So this was an amazing experience  and again  yes  it was a game  but they didn't write newspaper articles  people didn't say    you know  really   I can die now because the Red Sox won.  And many people did. So games  it means something more to us. It absolutely means something more. So now  just  this is an abrupt transition here. There was three years where I actually did have a real job  sort of. I was the head of a college department teaching games  so  again  it was sort of a real job  and now I just got to talk about making as opposed to making them. And I was at a dinner. Part of the job of it  when you're a chair of a department  is to eat  and I did that very well  and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson. So this is Zig in this photograph. This is also one of Zig's photographs. He's a photographer. And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself  and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation. And this particular shot  this is one of the more traditional shots. This is a rain dancer. And this is one of my favorite shots here. So you can look at this  and maybe you've even seen things like this. This is an expression of culture  right  And this is actually from his Degradation series. And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just  look at that little boy there. Can you imagine  Now let's  we can see that's a traditional Native American. Now I just want to change that guy's race. Just imagine if that's a black guy. So   Honey  come here  let's get your picture with the black guy.  Right  Like  seriously  nobody would do this. It baffles the mind. And so Zig  being Indian  likewise it baffles his mind. His favorite photograph    my favorite photograph of his  which I don't have in here is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.  Laughter  So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer  and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred  and it was on an Indian reservation. He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it  but when he got there  he discovered he couldn't do it. He just couldn't capture the picture. And so they were talking back and forth about this question. Do you take the picture or not  And that was fascinating to me as a game designer  because it never occurs to me  like  should I make the game about this difficult topic or not  Because we just make things that are fun or  you know  will make you feel fear  you know  that visceral excitement. But every other medium does it. So this is my kid. This is Maezza  and when she was seven years old  she came home from school one day  and like I do every single day  I asked her   What'd you do today   So she said   We talked about the Middle Passage.  Now  this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black  and I knew this day was coming. I wasn't expecting it at seven. I don't know why  but I wasn't. Anyways  so I asked her   How do you feel about that   So she proceeded to tell me  and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here. So the ships start in England  they come down from England  they go to Africa  they go across the ocean    that's the Middle Passage part   they come to America where the slaves are sold  she's telling me. But Abraham Lincoln was elected president  and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation  and now they're free. Pause for about    seconds.  Can I play a game  Mommy   And I thought  that's it  And so  you know  this is the Middle Passage  this is an incredibly significant event  and she's treating it like  basically some black people went on a cruise  is more or less how it sounds to her.  Laughter  And so  to me  I wanted more value in this  so when she asked if she could play a game  I said   Yes.   Laughter  And so I happened to have all of these little pieces. I'm a game designer  so I have this stuff sitting around my house. So I said   Yeah  you can play a game   and I give her a bunch of these  and I tell her to paint them in different families. These are pictures of Maezza when she was   God  it still chokes me up seeing these. So she's painting her little families. So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat. This was the boat. It was made quickly obviously.  Laughter  And so the basic gist of it is  I grabbed a bunch of families  and she's like   Mommy  but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things.  And she says   They want to go.  And I said   Honey  no they don't want to go. This is the Middle Passage. Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage.  So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother  and as we're going across the ocean  following these rules  she realizes that she's rolling pretty high  and she says to me   We're not going to make it.  And she realizes  you know  we don't have enough food  and so she asks what to do  and I say   Well  we can either     Remember  she's seven     We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side.  And she    just the look on her face came over and she said    now mind you this is after a month of    this is Black History Month  right  After a month she says to me   Did this really happen   And I said   Yes.  And so she said   So  if I came out of the woods    this is her brother and sister    If I came out of the woods  Avalon and Donovan might be gone.   Yes.   But I'd get to see them in America.   No.   But what if I saw them  You know  couldn't we stay together    No.   So Daddy could be gone.   Yes.  And she was fascinated by this  and she started to cry  and I started to cry  and her father started to cry  and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage  but there it goes.  Laughter  And so  we made this game  and she got it. She got it because she spent time with these people. It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie. And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience. This is the game  which I've ended up calling The New World  because I like the phrase. I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships. But when this happened  I saw the whole planet. I was so excited. It was like  I'd been making games for    some years  and then I decided to do it again. My history is Irish. So this is a game called S och n Leat. It's  peace be with you.  It's the entire history of my family in a single game. I made another game called Train. I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics  and if you're going to cover a difficult topic  this is one you need to cover  and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own. And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears. This is a game with        individual pieces. I was crazy when I decided to start it  but I'm in the middle of it now. It's the same thing. I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games. And the one I'm working on right now  which is    because I'm right in the middle of it  and these for some reason choke me up like crazy    is a game called Mexican Kitchen Workers. And originally it was a math problem more or less. Like  here's the economics of illegal immigration. And the more I learned about the Mexican culture    my partner is Mexican   the more I learned that  you know  for all of us  food is a basic need  but  and it is obviously with Mexicans too  but it's much more than that. It's an expression of love. It's an expression of   God  I'm totally choking up way more than I thought. I'll look away from the picture. It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you. It's how they say they care  and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying  food  in the first sentence. And so to me  this beautiful culture  this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games. And so games  for a change  it changes how we see topics  it changes how our perceptions about those people in topics  and it changes ourselves. We change as people through games  because we're involved  and we're playing  and we're learning as we do so. Thank you.  Applause  We conventionally divide space into private and public realms  and we know these legal distinctions very well because we've become experts at protecting our private property and private space. But we're less attuned to the nuances of the public. What translates generic public space into qualitative space  I mean  this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade. And we're doing this through some case studies. A large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time. And another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that's grown out of sync with its time. We've been working on democratizing Lincoln Center for a public that doesn't usually have      to spend on an opera ticket. So we've been eating  drinking  thinking  living public space for quite a long time. And it's taught us really one thing  and that is to truly make good public space  you have to erase the distinctions between architecture  urbanism  landscape  media design and so on. It really goes beyond distinction. Now we're moving onto Washington  D.C. and we're working on another transformation  and that is for the existing Hirshhorn Museum that's sited on the most revered public space in America  the National Mall. The Mall is a symbol of American democracy. And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing  it's not an image  it's not an artifact  actually it's a space  and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side. It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power. It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place. And they're inscribed in there forever    like the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and the great speech that Martin Luther King gave there. The Vietnam protests  the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of AIDS  the march for women's reproductive rights  right up until almost the present. The Mall is the greatest civic stage in this country for dissent. And it's synonymous with free speech  even if you're not sure what it is that you have to say. It may just be a place for civic commiseration. There is a huge disconnect  we believe  between the communicative and discursive space of the Mall and the museums that line it to either side. And that is that those museums are usually passive  they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience  as the receiver of information. And so you can see dinosaurs and insects and collections of locomotives and all of that  but you're really not involved  you're being talked to. When Richard Koshalek took over as director of the Hirshhorn in       he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place  at the seat of power in the U.S. And while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time  there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness. The question is  is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs  And could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy  There are over     embassies in Washington D.C. There are over     think tanks. There should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy into  and somehow through  the museum. There should be some kind of brain trust. So the Hirshhorn  as we began to think about it  and as we evolved the mission  with Richard and his team    it's really his life blood. But beyond exhibiting contemporary art  the Hirshhorn will become a public forum  a place of discourse for issues around arts  culture  politics and policy. It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum. It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference. It would have the informality of the town square. And for this new initiative  the Hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary  deployable structure. This is it. This is the Hirshhorn    so a     foot diameter concrete doughnut designed in the early '  s by Gordon Bunshaft. It's hulking  it's silent  it's cloistered  it's arrogant  it's a design challenge. Architects love to hate it. One redeeming feature is it's lifted up off the ground and it's got this void  and it's got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style. And around that space  the ring is actually galleries. Very  very difficult to mount shows in there. When the Hirshhorn opened  Ada Louise Huxstable  the New York Times critic  had some choice words   Neo penitentiary modern.   A maimed monument and a maimed Mall for a maimed collection.  Almost four decades later  how will this building expand for a new progressive program  Where would it go  It can't go in the Mall. There is no space there. It can't go in the courtyard. It's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures. Well there's always the hole. But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly  How could it become iconic  And what language would it take  The Hirshhorn sits among the Mall's monumental institutions. Most are neoclassical  heavy and opaque  made of stone or concrete. And the question is  if one inhabits that space  what is the material of the Mall  It has to be different from the buildings there. It has to be something entirely different. It has to be air. In our imagination  it has to be light. It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless. And it has to be free. So this is the big idea. It's a giant airbag. The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can    the top and sides. But more poetically  we like to think of the structure as inhaling the democratic air of the Mall  bringing it into itself. The before and the after. It was dubbed  the bubble  by the press. That was the lounge. It's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction. The membrane is translucent. It's made of silcon coated glass fiber. And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time. This is the view from the inside. So you might have been wondering how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government. It had to be approved by actually two agencies. And one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the Mall. I blush whenever I show this. It is yours to interpret. But one thing I can say is that it's a combination of iconoclasm and adoration. There was also some creative interpretation involved. The Congressional Buildings Act of      limits the height of buildings in D.C. to     feet  except for spires  towers  domes and minarets. This pretty much exempts monuments of the church and state. And the bubble is     ft. That's the Pantheon next to it. It's about  .  million cubic feet of compressed air. And so we argued it on the merits of being a dome. So there it is  very stately  among all the stately buildings in the Mall. And while this Hirshhorn is not landmarked  it's very  very historically sensitive. And so we couldn't really touch its surfaces. We couldn't leave any traces behind. So we strained it from the edges  and we held it by cables. It's a study of some bondage techniques  which are actually very important because it's hit by wind all the time. There's one permanent steel ring at the top  but it can't be seen from any vantage point on the Mall. There are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit. It glows from within  it's translucent. But it can't be more lit than the Capitol or some of the monuments. So it's down the hierarchy on lighting. So it comes to the site twice a year. It's taken off the delivery truck. It's hoisted. And then it's inflated with this low pressure air. And then it's restrained with the cables. And then it's ballasted with water at the very bottom. This is a very strange moment where we were asked by the bureaucracy at the Mall how much time would it take to install. And we said  well the first erection would take one week. And they really connected with that idea. And then it was really easy all the way through. So we didn't really have that many hurdles  I have to say  with the government and all the authorities. But some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones. This is the warp and weft. This is a point cloud. There are extreme pressures. This is a very  very unusual building in that there's no gravity load  but there's load in every direction. And I'm just going to zip through these slides. And this is the space in action. So flexible interior for discussions  just like this  but in the round    luminous and reconfigurable. Could be used for anything  for performances  films  for installations. And the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations. Form and content are together here. The bubble is an anti monument. The ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity. Art and politics occupy an ambiguous site outside the museum walls  but inside of the museum's core  blending its air with the democratic air of the Mall. And the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of     . Thank you. America's public energy conversation boils down to this question  Would you rather die of A  oil wars  or B  climate change  or C  nuclear holocaust  or D  all of the above  Oh  I missed one  or E  none of the above  That's the one we're not normally offered. What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing  Could we have fuel without fear  Could we reinvent fire  You see  fire made us human  fossil fuels made us modern. But now we need a new fire that makes us safe  secure  healthy and durable. Let's see how. Four fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo. Those fossil fuels have built our civilization. They've created our wealth. They've enriched the lives of billions. But they also have rising costs to our security  economy  health and environment that are starting to erode  if not outweigh their benefits. So we need a new fire. And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity  each of which puts two fifths of the fossil carbon in the air. But they're really quite distinct. Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil    although almost half is made from coal. Their uses are quite concentrated. Three fourths of our oil fuel is transportation. Three fourths of our electricity powers buildings. And the rest of both runs factories. So very efficient vehicles  buildings and factories save oil and coal  and also natural gas that can displace both of them. But today's energy system is not just inefficient  it is also disconnected  aging  dirty and insecure. So it needs refurbishment. By      though  it could become efficient  connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos  factories and buildings all relying on a modern  secure and resilient electricity system. We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by      and use one third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply. This could cost  by       five trillion dollars less in net present value  that is expressed as a lump sum today  than business as usual    assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero    a conservatively low estimate. Yet this cheaper energy system could support     percent bigger U.S. economy all without needing oil or coal  or for that matter nuclear energy. Moreover  this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes  mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock. Let me say that again. I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal  five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit. In other words  we're going to use our most effective institutions    private enterprise co evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions. And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security  or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health  reinventing fire makes sense and makes money. General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies. So in reinventing fire  we integrated all four sectors that use energy    transportation  buildings  industry and electricity    and we integrated four kinds of innovation  not just technology and policy  but also design and business strategy. Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts  especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities. Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day  plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs  raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP. Our mobility fuel goes three fifths to automobiles. So let's start by making autos oil free. Two thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight. And every unit of energy you save at the wheels  by taking out weight or drag  saves seven units in the tank  because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels. Unfortunately  over the past quarter century  epidemic obesity has made our two ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have. But today  ultralight  ultrastrong materials  like carbon fiber composites  can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build. Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them  so their engines get smaller. Indeed  that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper. So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today  while the driving cost  even from the start  is very much lower. So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other    namely ultralight materials  making them into structures and electric propulsion. The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates  that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones. And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency. The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers. Of course  computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry  while typewriter makers have vanished. So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next    years  but then also make electrification affordable  and that displaces the rest of the oil. America could lead this next automotive revolution. Currently the leader is Germany. Last year  Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting     miles a gallon. Also last year  BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car  they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries. And they said   We do not intend to be a typewriter maker.  Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year. Seven years ago  an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part  which doubles as a carbon cap. In one minute    and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is. Don't worry about dropping it  it's tougher than titanium. Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it. But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance. They can save four fifths of the capital needed to make autos. They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to    times as much crash energy per pound as steel. If we made all of our autos this way  it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias  or half an OPEC  by drilling in the Detroit formation  a very prospective play. And all those mega barrels under Detroit cost an average of    bucks a barrel. They are all American  carbon free and inexhaustible. The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles. In the five years ending with       Walmart saved    percent of the fuel per ton mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design. But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two thirds. And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes  now on the drawing board  can save close to a trillion dollars. Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R D has given us the Internet  the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries. As we design and build vehicles better  we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving. Instead of just seeing the travel grow  we can use innovative pricing  charging for road infrastructure by the mile  not by the gallon. We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing. We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be  so they don't need to go somewhere else. And we can use smart IT to make traffic free flowing. Together  those things can give us the same or better access with    to    percent less driving  saving another  .  trillion dollars  plus  .  trillion dollars from using trucks more productively. So    years hence  when you add it all up  a far more mobile U.S. economy can use no oil. Saving or displacing barrels for    bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred  adds up to a    trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero. So to get mobility without oil  to phase out the oil  we can get efficient and then switch fuels. Those     to     mile per gallon equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells  electricity and advanced biofuels. The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels. The trucks could even use natural gas. But no vehicles will need oil. And the most biofuel we might need  just three million barrels a day  can be made two thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate. Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call  institutional acupuncture.  We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly  we stick little needles in it to get it flowing  working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon. And the long transition is already well under way. In fact  three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil  not in supply  but in demand. And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around     . In other words  oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices. But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid. Rather  when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids  they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power. So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately. And they also converge the oil story with our second big story  saving electricity and then making it differently. And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector  because we've got   st century technology and speed colliding head on with   th and   th century institutions  rules and cultures. Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it. Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them. So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper. But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy  America's electricity use could actually shrink  even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos. And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends. Over the next    years  buildings  which use three quarters of the electricity  can triple or quadruple their energy productivity  saving  .  trillion dollars  net present value  with a    percent internal rate of return or in English  the savings are worth four times what they cost. And industry can accelerate too  doubling its energy productivity with a    percent internal rate of return. The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings. That is  it can give you expanding returns  not diminishing returns. That is how our      retrofit is saving over two fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building    remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light  but reflect heat. plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third. And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved    million dollars of capital cost  which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years. Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry. Dow's billion dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars. But industry as a whole has another half trillion dollars of energy still to save. For example  three fifths of the world's electricity runs motors. Half of that runs pumps and fans. And those can all be made more efficient  and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating    improvements  paying back in about a year. But first we ought to be capturing bigger  cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks. For example  pumps  the biggest use of motors  move liquid through pipes. But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least    percent less energy  not by getting better pumps  but just by replacing long  thin  crooked pipes with fat  short  straight pipes. This is not about new technology  it's just rearranging our metal furniture. Of course  it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs. So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three fifths used in motors  Well  from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses  only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow. But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards  and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves    units of fuel cost  pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls  global weirding  back at the power plant. And of course  as you go back upstream  the components get smaller and therefore cheaper. Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than    billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns    everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries. Typically our retrofit designs save about    to    percent of the energy and pay back in a few years  while the new facility designs save    to    odd percent with generally lower capital cost. Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity  chiefly renewables. China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost. In fact  these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart. And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers. Already in about    states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill. Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company. And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams. Renewables are no longer a fringe activity. For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable  mainly lately in developing countries. In       renewables other than big hydro  particularly wind and solar cells  got     billion dollars of private investment  and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding    billion watts in that one year. That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year    a number that goes up    or    percent a year. In contrast  the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk. In fact in this country  no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital  despite seven years of     plus percent subsidies. So how else could we replace the coal fired power plants  Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and  combined with renewables  can displace them more than    times at less than their replacement cost. But we only need to replace them once. We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on  because they're       whereas wind and solar power are variable  and hence supposedly unreliable. Actually no generator is     . They all break. And when a big plant goes down  you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds  often for weeks or months  often without warning. That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants. And in exactly the same way  the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations. Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted  integrated and diversified by both type and location. And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid. That is how  for example  four German states in      were    to    percent wind powered. Portugal was    percent renewable powered  Denmark   . And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity. In America  our aging  dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by     . And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same  about six trillion dollars at present value    whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so called clean coal  or renewables that are more or less centralized. But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks  around national security  fuel  water  finance  technology  climate and health. For example  our over centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack. But that blackout risk disappears  and all of the other risks are best managed  with distributed renewables organized into local micro grids that normally interconnect  but can stand alone at need. That is  they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly. That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply. They think they need that  how about the rest of us that they're defending  We want our stuff to work too. At about the same cost as business as usual  this would maximize national security  customer choice  entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation. Together  efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector. Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables. And those utilities were rewarded  as they still are in    states  for selling you more electricity. However  especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills  the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency  demand response  cogeneration  renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage. So our energy future is not fate  but choice  and that choice is very flexible. In       for example  government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down. And I heretically suggested it could go down several fold. Well that's what's actually happened so far. It's fallen by half. But with today's much better technologies  more mature delivery channels and integrative design  we can do far more and even cheaper. So to solve the energy problem  we just needed to enlarge it. And the results may at first seem incredible  but as Marshall McLuhan said   Only puny secrets need protection. Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.  Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions  both driven by modern efficiency  and you get the really big story  reinventing fire  where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by       saving   trillion dollars  growing the economy  .  fold  strengthening out national security  oh  and by the way  by getting rid of the oil and coal  reducing the fossil carbon emissions by    to    percent. Now if you like any of those outcomes  you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important. So focusing on outcomes  not motives  can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge. This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges    climate change  nuclear proliferation  energy insecurity  energy poverty    all of which make us less safe. Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives  with some more hatching. Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too. Former oil man Maurice Strong said   Not all the fossils are in the fuel.  But as Edgar Woolard  who used to chair Dupont  reminds us   Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because   he said   they simply won't be around long term.  I've described not just a once in a civilization business opportunity  but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species. We humans are inventing a new fire  not dug from below  but flowing from above  not scarce  but bountiful  not local  but everywhere  not transient  but permanent  not costly  but free. And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure  this new fire is flameless. Efficiently used  it really can do our work without working our undoing. Each of you owns a piece of that    trillion prize. And our new book  Reinventing Fire  describes how you can capture it. So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire.com  let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other  with everyone around you  to help make the world richer  fairer  cooler and safer by together reinventing fire. Thank you. Usually I like working in my shop  but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river  then I just love it. And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water  and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers. You have no idea how much time I spend. This is the  Double Raindrop.  Of all my sculptures  it's the most talkative. It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other. Instead of expanding circles  they're expanding hexagons. All the sculptures move by mechanical means. Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave  Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on. Eight hundred two liter soda bottles    oh yea. Four hundred aluminum cans. Tule is a reed that's native to California  and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious. A single drop of rain increasing amplitude. The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip. This adds together four different waves. And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths and increase the single. The mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about       pulleys. Four hundred and forty five strings in a three dimensional weave. Transferred to a larger scale    actually a lot larger  with a lot of help           bicycle reflectors    a    day install.  Connected  is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. Strings attached to dancers. This is very early rehearsal footage  but the finished work's on tour and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks. A pair of helices and    wooden slats. Take your finger and draw this line. Summer  fall  winter  spring  noon  dusk  dark  dawn. Have you ever seen those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky  Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer  What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave of that object poked through into our world  The Earth is neither flat nor round. It's wavy. It sounds good  but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth  and I'll tell you why. I have a two year old daughter who's the best thing ever. And I'm just going to come out and say it  My daughter is not a wave. And you might say   Surely  Rueben  if you took even just the slightest step back  the cycles of hunger and eating  waking and sleeping  laughing and crying would emerge as pattern.  But I would say   If I did that  too much would be lost.  This tension between the need to look deeper and the beauty and immediacy of the world  where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for  this tension is what makes the sculptures move. And for me  the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave. Let me show you one more. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks. June Cohen  Looking at each of your sculptures  they evoke so many different images. Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves  and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math. Is there an actual inspiration behind each one  Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it  RM  Well some of them definitely have a direct observation    like literally two raindrops falling  and just watching that pattern is so stunning. And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff. I like working with my hands. There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood and trying to make it move. JC  And does it ever change  Do you think you're designing one thing  and then when it's produced it looks like something else  RM  The  Double Raindrop  I worked on for nine months  and when I finally turned it on  I actually hated it. The very moment I turned it on  I hated it. It was like a really deep down gut reaction  and I wanted to throw it out. And I happened to have a friend who was over  and he said   Why don't you just wait.  And I waited  and the next day I liked it a bit better  the next day I liked it a bit better  and now I really love it. And so I guess  one  the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes  and two  it does not look like as expected. JC  The relationship evolves over time. Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. RM  Thanks.  JC  Thank you  Reuben.  I don't know why  but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than    percent of the world's population can go online to learn  to create and to share. And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow. A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online. As the parent of a nine year old girl  that number seems awfully low. But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us  it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world. And increasingly  the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy. Today  what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place  it's not. And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen  we are like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods. We are leaving our birthdays  our places of residence  our interests and preferences  our relationships  our financial histories  and on and on it goes. Now don't get me wrong  I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing. In fact  when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent  I want some sites to understand my habits. It helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with. But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked  that's when the problem arises. It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking  and it is very big business. In fact  there's an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us. And when all of that data is held  they can do almost whatever they want with it. This is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules. Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe  it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked. So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further. The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you. The red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that I have not navigated to  but are following me. The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to. And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me  but I have no idea who they are. All of them are connected  as you can see  to form a picture of me on the Web. And this is my profile. So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal. I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day. Now like most of you  I actually start my day going online and checking email. I then go to a news site  look for some headlines. And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network. Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table  and I asked her   Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school   And she  of course  naturally as a nine year old  looked at me and said quizzically   What's literacy   So I sent her online  of course  to look it up. Now let me stop here. We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly    sites that are tracking me. I have navigated to a total of four. So let me fast forward through the rest of my day. I go to work  I check email  I log onto a few more social sites  I blog  I check more news reports  I share some of those news reports  I go look at some videos  pretty typical day    in this case  actually fairly pedantic    and at the end of the day  as my day winds down  look at my profile. The red dots have exploded. The gray dots have grown exponentially. All in all  there's over     sites that are now tracking my personal information  most all of them without my consent. I look at this picture and it freaks me out. This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web. And why is this happening  Pretty simple    it's huge business. The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over    billion dollars today. And as adults  we're certainly not alone. At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile  I installed one for my daughter. And on one single Saturday morning  over two hours on the Internet  here's her Collusion profile. This is a nine year old girl navigating to principally children's sites. I move from this  from freaked out to enraged. This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate  this is me being a parent. Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement. I can tell you  there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by. We'd take action. It may not be good action  but we would take action. We can't sit idly by here either. This is happening today. Privacy is not an option  and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet. Our voices matter and our actions matter even more. Today we've launched Collusion. You can download it  install it in Firefox  to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods. Going forward  all of our voices need to be heard. Because what we don't know can actually hurt us. Because the memory of the Internet is forever. We are being watched. It's now time for us to watch the watchers. Thank you. What you have here is an electronic cigarette. It's something that's  since it was invented a year or two ago  has given me untold happiness. A little bit of it  I think  is the nicotine  but there's something much bigger than that. Which is ever since  in the U.K.  they banned smoking in public places  I've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again. And the reason  I only worked out just the other day  which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people  you don't actually want to spend all the time talking. It's really  really tiring. Sometimes you just want to stand there silently  alone with your thoughts. Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. Now the problem is  when you can't smoke  if you stand and stare out of the window on your own  you're an antisocial  friendless idiot. If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette  you're a fucking philosopher. So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated. What we have is exactly the same thing  the same activity  but one of them makes you feel great and the other one  with just a small change of posture  makes you feel terrible. And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality. And reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness. Why  for example  are pensioners much happier than the young unemployed  Both of them  after all  are in exactly the same stage of life. You both have too much time on your hands and not much money. But pensioners are reportedly very  very happy  whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed. The reason  I think  is that the pensioners believe they've chosen to be pensioners  whereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them. In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly  because they've re branded unemployment. If you're an upper middle class English person  you call unemployment  a year off.  And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing  but having a son who's unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment. But actually the power to re brand things    to understand that actually our experiences  costs  things don't actually much depend on what they really are  but on how we view them    I genuinely think can't be overstated. There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor. Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor  which pains the dogs. The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box. And when it nuzzles the button  the electric shock stops. The other dog doesn't have the button. It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box  but it has no control over the circumstances. Generally the first dog can be relatively content. The second dog lapses into complete depression. The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives. It's an interesting question. We ask the question    the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation. But I think there's another debate to be asked  which is the level of control we have over our tax money. That what costs us    pounds in one context can be a curse. What costs us    pounds in a different context we may actually welcome. You know  pay        pounds in tax toward health and you're merely feeling a mug. Pay        pounds to endow a hospital ward and you're called a philanthropist. I'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax. So I'll give you one in return. How you frame things really matters. Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece  Because they are actually the same thing. What you call them actually affects how you react to them  viscerally and morally. I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest. One of my great friends  a professor called Nick Chater  who's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London  believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows. I think that's true actually. I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do. But what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology. At least pre Kahneman perhaps  we didn't have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering  of neoclassical economics. So people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model. We didn't have a framework. This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls  a latticework on which to hang your ideas.  Engineers  economists  classical economists all had a very  very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung. We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model. And what that means is that in looking at solutions  we've probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions  Newtonian solutions  and not nearly enough to the psychological ones. You know my example of the Eurostar. Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about    minutes. For  .   percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains  which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey  but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more. For maybe    percent of the money  you could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers. You'd still have five  million  pounds in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically  I think it's because there's an imbalance  an asymmetry  in the way we treat creative  emotionally driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational  numerical  spreadsheet driven ideas. If you're a creative person  I think quite rightly  you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you. You have to go in and you have to have a cost benefit analysis  a feasibility study  an ROI study and so forth. And I think that's probably right. But this does not apply the other way around. People who have an existing framework  an economic framework  an engineering framework  feel that actually logic is its own answer. What they don't say is   Well the numbers all seem to add up  but before I present this idea  I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better.  And so we  artificially I think  prioritize what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas. An example of a great psychological idea  The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn't add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains  they put dot matrix display board on the platforms. Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality  its duration  but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait. Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes  knuckle biting going   When's this train going to damn well arrive   Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea. Red traffic lights have a countdown delay. It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments. Why  Because road rage  impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait. In China  not really understanding the principle behind this  they applied the same principle to green traffic lights. Which isn't a great idea. You're     yards away  you realize you've got five seconds to go  you floor it. The Koreans  very assiduously  did test both. The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights  it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights. This is all I'm asking for really in human decision making  is the consideration of these three things. I'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other. I'm merely saying that when you solve problems  you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle. If you actually look at a great business  you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play. Really  really successful businesses    Google is great  great technological success  but it's also based on a very good psychological insight  People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else. It's an innate thing called goal dilution. Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this. Everybody else at the time of Google  more or less  was trying to be a portal. Yes  there's a search function  but you also have weather  sports scores  bits of news. Google understood that if you're just a search engine  people assume you're a very  very good search engine. All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television. And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players. And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things  but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go   Uck. It's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player.  So we walk out of the shops with one of each. Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one. I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn't even realize were problems at all. This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics. Don't give them    white pills. Give them    white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones. It's called chunking. The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle. One of the great mistakes  I think  of economics is it fails to understand that what something is  whether it's retirement  unemployment  cost  is a function  not only of its amount  but also its meaning. This is a toll crossing in Britain. Quite often queues happen at the tolls. Sometimes you get very  very severe queues. You could apply the same principle actually  if you like  to the security lanes in airports. What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge  but go through a lane that's an express lane  It's not an unreasonable thing to do. It's an economically efficient thing to do. Time means more to some people than others. If you're waiting trying to get to a job interview  you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane. If you're on the way to visit your mother in law  you'd probably prefer to stay on the left. The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution  people hate it. Because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue  and  Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence   On the other hand  change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management  so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company  it goes to charity  and the mental willingness to pay completely changes. You have a relatively economically efficient solution  but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection  rather than being seen as bastardy. So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money. Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount  but where I think that money is going. And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy. It could revolutionize the public services. It could really change things quite significantly. Here's a guy you all need to study. He's an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the   th century in Vienna. What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud. And so they're predominantly interested in psychology. They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology  which is a prior discipline to the study of economics. Praxeology is the study of human choice  action and decision making. I think they're right. I think the danger we have in today's world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology. But as Charlie Munger says   If economics isn't behavioral  I don't know what the hell is.  Von Mises  interestingly  believes economics is just a subset of psychology. I think he just refers to economics as  the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity.  But von Mises  among many other things  I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing  the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value. We tend to  all of us    even those of us who work in marketing    to think of value in two ways. There's the real value  which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service  and then there's a kind of dubious value  which you create by changing the way people look at things. Von Mises completely rejected this distinction. And he used this following analogy. He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats  who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land. So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer  you created true value. If however  you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat  you weren't actually creating value  you were exploiting the shepherd. Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing. He says  if you run a restaurant  there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor. One of them creates  perhaps  the primary product    the thing we think we're paying for    the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product. And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong. Try this quick thought experiment. Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin starred food  but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there's human feces on the floor. The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further  it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor. And it's vital we understand this. If that seems like some strange  abstruse thing  in the U.K.  the post office had a    percent success rate at delivering first class mail the next day. They decided this wasn't good enough and they wanted to get it up to   . The effort to do that almost broke the organization. If at the same time you'd gone and asked people   What percentage of first class mail arrives the next day   the average answer  or the modal answer would have been    to    percent. Now if your perception is much worse than your reality  what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality  That's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks. What you need to do is first of all tell people that    percent of mail gets there the next day  first class mail. That's pretty good. I would argue  in Britain there's a much better frame of reference  which is to tell people that more first class mail arrives the next day in the U.K. than in Germany. Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something  just tell us we do it better than the Germans. Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed. It has to be said of the Germans that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job of creating a united Europe. The only thing they don't expect is they're uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans. But I'm British  that's the way we like it. What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky. We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it. All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted. When you drive away  your car feels as if it drives better. And the reason for this  unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of  is because perception is in any case leaky. Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded. I don't just mean through reported pain reduction  actual measured pain reduction. And so perception actually is leaky in any case. So if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect  you can damage the other. Thank you very much. Four years ago today  exactly  actually  I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie. Last September of       I started an online magazine for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com. My name's Tavi Gevinson  and the title of my talk is  Still Figuring It Out   and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme  and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.  Laughter  So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist. I am kind of a pop culture nerd  and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character  and  you know  movies and TV shows  these things have influence. My own website. So I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted  and instead we get these two dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot  like a Catwoman type  or she plays her sexuality up a lot  and it's seen as power. But they're not strong characters who happen to be female. They're completely flat  and they're basically cardboard characters. The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand  and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple  when  in actuality  women are complicated  women are multifaceted    not because women are crazy  but because people are crazy  and women happen to be people.  Laughter  So the flaws are the key. I'm not the first person to say this. What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses  who has flaws  who is maybe not immediately likable  but eventually relatable. I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it  so just wanted to acknowledge shows like  Mad Men   movies like  Bridesmaids   whose female characters or protagonists are complex  multifaceted. Lena Dunham  who's on here  her show on HBO that premiers next month   Girls   she said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions  and that feels accurate for all people  but you don't see women represented like that as much. Congrats  guys.  Laughs  But I don't feel that   I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way  and one group that we'll focus on today are teens  because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out  and in the '  s there was  Freaks and Geeks  and  My So Called Life   and their characters  Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase  I mean  the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out  basically  but those shows only lasted a season each  and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since. So this is a scientific diagram of my brain    Laughter    around the time when I was  when I started watching those TV shows. I was ending middle school  starting high school    I'm a sophomore now   and I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl. You can't be smart and pretty. You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion. You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people  usually men  will think of you. So I was trying to figure all that out  and I felt a little confused  and I said so on my blog  and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of one dimensional strong character empowerment thing because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist  they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs  never being insecure  never having doubts  having all of the answers. And this is not true  and  actually  reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion  a conversation  a process  and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I    I mean  I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since. But  yeah. So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing  their photography  whatever  to be a member of our staff. I got about       emails. My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people  and we launched last September. And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter  where I say that Rookie  we don't have all the answers  we're still figuring it out too  but the point is not to give girls the answers  and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves  but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission  they can ask their own questions  find their own answers  all of that  and Rookie  I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out. So I'm not saying   Be like us   and  We're perfect role models   because we're not  but we just want to help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions. I mean  we have articles called  On Taking Yourself Seriously  How to Not Care What People Think of You   but we also have articles like  oops    I'm figuring it out  Ha ha.  Laughter  If you use that  you can get away with anything. We also have articles called  How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes.  So all of that being said  I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site  that aren't just about being totally powerful  maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self esteem and your flaws and how you accept those. So what I you to take away from my talk  the lesson of all of this  is to just be Stevie Nicks. Like  that's all you have to do.  Laughter  Because my favorite thing about her  other than  like  everything  is that she is very    has always been unapologetically present on stage  and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them  and yeah  so please be Stevie Nicks. Thank you.  Applause  Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk  I was really chuckled  because  you see  my father's name was Ted  and much of my life  especially my musical life  is really a talk that I'm still having with him  or the part of me that he continues to be. Now Ted was a New Yorker  an all around theater guy  and he was a self taught illustrator and musician. He didn't read a note  and he was profoundly hearing impaired. Yet  he was my greatest teacher. Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids  his understanding of music was profound. And for him  it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you. And he did a painting of this experience  which he called  In the Realm of Music.  Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this. But he was tough when it came to music. He said   There are only two things that matter in music  what and how. And the thing about classical music  that what and how  it's inexhaustible.  That was his passion for the music. Both my parents really loved it. They didn't know all that much about it  but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them. And I think inspired by that memory  it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can  sort of pass it on through whatever means. And how people get this music  how it comes into their lives  really fascinates me. One day in New York  I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants. And a tough  slouchy kid got up to bat  and he took a swing and really connected. And he watched the ball fly for a second  and then he went   Dah dadaratatatah. Brah dada dadadadah.  And he ran around the bases. And I thought  go figure. How did this piece of   th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid  How was that passed on  How did he get to hear Mozart  Well when it comes to classical music  there's an awful lot to pass on  much more than Mozart  Beethoven or Tchiakovsky. Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over       years. And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive. Now the raw material of it  of course  is just the music of everyday life. It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches. But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down  to condense them to their absolute essence  and from that essence create a new language  a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are. It's a language that's still evolving. Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of  like concertos and symphonies  but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment    like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto. It's so simple  so evocative. So many emotions seem to be inside of it. Yet  of course  like all music  it's essentially not about anything. It's just a design of pitches and silence and time. And the pitches  the notes  as you know  are just vibrations. They're locations in the spectrum of sound. And whether we call them     per second  A  or        B flat    trust me  that's right    they're just phenomena. But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood. And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries  as have our preferences for them. So for example  in the   th century  people liked pieces that ended like this. And in the   th century  it was more like this. And in the   st century ... Now your   st century ears are quite happy with this last chord  even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room. And the reason you like it is because you've inherited  whether you knew it or not  centuries worth of changes in musical theory  practice and fashion. And in classical music we can follow these changes very  very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner  the way it's been passed on  notation. Now the impulse to notate  or  more exactly I should say  encode music has been with us for a very long time. In     B.C.  a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks. And a thousand years later  this impulse to notate took an entirely different form. And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass  Puer Natus est nobis    For Us is Born.  In the   th century  little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune. And in the   th century  a line was drawn  like a musical horizon line  to better pinpoint the pitch's location. And then in the   th century  more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly  and that led to the kind of notation we have today. Well notation not only passed the music on  notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely  because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale. Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded  saved  considered  prioritized  made into intricate designs. And from this moment  classical music became what it most essentially is  a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature  instinct and intelligence. And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition. Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move  but a composer is considering all possible moves  testing them out  prioritizing them out  until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness. Now some of the greatest composers  like Bach  were combinations of these two things. Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master. Mozart was the same way. But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason  instinct and intelligence. And every musical era had different priorities of these things  different things to pass on  different 'whats' and 'hows'. So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise God. And by the     s  music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky. The 'how' was a style called polyphony  music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy's geocentric universe. This was truly the music of the spheres. This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known. And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen    a radical new move  which in      is what did happen. Ah  wicked  cruel fate  Ah  baleful stars  Ah  avaricious heaven  MTT  This  of course  was the birth of opera  and its development put music on a radical new course. The what now was not to mirror the mind of God  but to follow the emotion turbulence of man. And the how was harmony  stacking up the pitches to form chords. And the chords  it turned out  were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions. And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us  the triads  either the major one  which we think is happy  or the minor one  which we perceive as sad. But what's the actual difference between these two chords  It's just these two notes in the middle. It's either E natural  and     vibrations per second  or E flat  at    . So the big difference between human happiness and sadness     freakin' vibrations. So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions. And in fact  as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature  harmony grew more complex to reflect it. Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words. Now with all this possibility  classical music really took off. It's the time in which the big forms began to arise. And the effects of technology began to be felt also  because printing put music  the scores  the codebooks of music  into the hands of performers everywhere. And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible. This is when those big forms arose    the symphonies  the sonatas  the concertos. And in these big architectures of time  composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime. A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger  over the course of a half an hour  step by exacting step of his route  to the moment when he could make it across to joy. And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues  like gripping ones of culture  such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality. But whatever direction the music took  one thing until recently was always the same  and that was when the musicians stopped playing  the music stopped. Now this moment so fascinates me. I find it such a profound one. What happens when the music stops  Where does it go  What's left  What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance  Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude  And how might that change their lives  To me this is the intimate  personal side of music. It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it. And to me that's the most essential of all. Mostly it's been a person to person thing  a teacher student  performer audience thing  and then around      came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on  albeit an impersonal one. People could now hear music all the time  even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument  read music or even go to concerts. And technology democratized music by making everything available. It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing. And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes  using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences. At the same time technology  by taking over the role that notation had always played  shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side. The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced  diced  layered and  God knows  distributed and sold. What's the long term effect of this on us or on music  Nobody knows. The question remains  What happens when the music stops  What sticks with people  Now that we have unlimited access to music  what does stick with us  Well let me show you a story of what I mean by  really sticking with us.  I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home  and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker. He came over to a piano that was there  and he balanced himself and began playing something like this. And he said something like   Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven.  And I suddenly got it  and I said   Friend  by any chance are you trying to play this   And he said   Yes  yes. I was a little boy. The symphony  Isaac Stern  the concerto  I heard it.  And I thought  my God  how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed  across the room to recover the memory of this music that  after everything else in his life is sloughing away  still means so much to him  Well  that's why I take every performance so seriously  why it matters to me so much. I never know who might be there  who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life. But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music. That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series  Keeping Score  with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music  and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education. And of course  the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world. And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype. There's just a role here for so many people    teachers  parents  performers    to be explorers together. Sure  the big events attract a lot of attention  but what really matters is what goes on every single day. We need your perspectives  your curiosity  your voices. And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers  chefs  code writers  taxi drivers  people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on. You don't need to worry about knowing anything. If you're curious  if you have a capacity for wonder  if you're alive  you know all that you need to know. You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit. Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised  amused inspired. All that 'what'  all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why'  to dive in and pass it on. Thank you. I love my food. And I love information. My children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other. But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed  the point in my life when the two passions merged  the journey of learning that took place from that point. And one idea I want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food  I was born in Calcutta    a family where my father and his father before him were journalists  and they wrote magazines in the English language. That was the family business. And as a result of that  I grew up with books everywhere around the house. And I mean books everywhere around the house. And that's actually a shop in Calcutta  but it's a place where we like our books. In fact  I've got        of them now and no Kindle in sight. But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere  with people to talk to about those books  this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing. By the time I was     I had a deep passion for books. It wasn't the only passion I had. I was a South Indian brought up in Bengal. And two of the things about Bengal  they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets. So by the time I grew up  again  I had a well established passion for food. Now I was growing up in the late '  s and early '  s  and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in  but these two were the ones that differentiated me. And then life was fine  dandy. Everything was okay  until I got to about the age of     and I went to a movie called  Short Circuit.  Oh  some of you have seen it. And apparently it's being remade right now and it's going to be coming out next year. It's the story of this experimental robot which got electrocuted and found a life. And as it ran  this thing was saying   Give me input. Give me input.  And I suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing. Energy came to it in some form or shape  data came to it in some form or shape. And I began to think  I wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things I had as input    as if food and information were similar in some form or shape. I started doing some research then  and this was the    year journey  and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains. And as I went to research that even further  I got to a point where I discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis. That actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static. What changed was the balance of the tissues available. And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue. And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about     . It's a lady named Leslie Aiello. And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other. If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large  you had to live with a smaller gut. That then set me off completely to say  Okay  these two are connected. So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said  So we were hunter gathers of information. We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information. Does that really explain what we're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays  Because those people who were hunter gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted  and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it  create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement. So there was always going to be a tension within that. And everything I saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter gatherers. And this is happening here. When I moved to preparation  this same thing was true  expect that there were two schools. One group of people said you can distill your information  you can extract value  separate it and serve it up  while another group turned around and said no  no you can ferment it. You bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way. The same is again true with information. But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable. Because what I began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this. They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients. Do you cook it  Do you have it served to you  Do you go to a restaurant  The same is true every time as I started thinking about information. The analogies were getting crazy    that information had sell by dates  that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market  on corporate values  etc. And by this time I was hooked. And this is about    years into this process. And I began to start thinking of myself as we start having mash ups of fact and fiction  docu dramas  mockumentaries  whatever you call it. Are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it  We start labeling information for the fact percentage  Are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off  as a famine  Which brings me to the final element of this. Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload  there is only filter failure. I put it to you that information  if viewed from the point of food  is never a production issue  you never speak of food overload. Fundamentally it's a consumption issue. And we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves  exercise within ourselves  to have the faculties to be able to deal with information  to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly. In fact  when I saw  Supersize Me   I starting thinking of saying  What would happen if an individual had    days nonstop Fox News  Would there be time to be able to work with it  So you start really understanding that you can have diseases  toxins  a need to balance your diet  and once you start looking  and from that point on  everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information  the production of information  the preparation of information  I've looked at from the viewpoint of food. It has probably not helped my waistline any because I like practicing on both sides. But I'd like to leave you with just that question  If you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food  what would you do differently  Thank you very much for your time. I'm a very lucky person. I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it. And my passion was inspired at the age of seven  when my parents first took me to Morocco  at the edge of the Sahara Desert. Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home. What an amazing experience. And it made me want to explore more. So as a filmmaker  I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before. And what's more  I'm really lucky  because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide. Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step. You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects  but new technology is changing the way we can film. It's enabling us to get fresh  new images and tell brand new stories. In Nature's Great Events  a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough  we wanted to do just that. Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar. You see them all the time  you think. But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed. So what we did  we went to Alaska  which is where the grizzlies rely on really high  almost inaccessible  mountain slopes for their denning. And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air. thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep. There is nothing to eat up here  but the conditions were ideal for hibernation. Lots of snow in which to dig a den. To find food  mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast  where the snow will already be melting. But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs. These mountains are dangerous places  but ultimately the fate of these bear families  and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific  depends on the salmon. KB  I love that shot. I always get goosebumps every time I see it. That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro stabilized camera. And it's a wonderful bit of gear  because it's like having a flying tripod  crane and dolly all rolled into one. But technology alone isn't enough. To really get the money shots  it's down to being in the right place at the right time. And that sequence was especially difficult. The first year we got nothing. We had to go back the following year  all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska. And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks. And eventually we got lucky. The cloud lifted  the wind was still  and even the bear showed up. And we managed to get that magic moment. For a filmmaker  new technology is an amazing tool  but the other thing that really  really excites me is when new species are discovered. Now  when I heard about one animal  I knew we had to get it for my next series  Untamed Americas  for National Geographic. In       a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador. And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower. It depends solely on the bat. Now  the series hasn't even aired yet  so you're the very first to see this. See what you think. A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute. But how to reach it  Necessity is the mother of evolution. This two and a half inch bat has a three and a half inch tongue  the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world. If human  he'd have a nine foot tongue. KB  What a tongue. We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by    times. So imagine how quick that thing is in real life. Now people often ask me   Where's your favorite place on the planet   And the truth is I just don't have one. There are so many wonderful places. But some locations draw you back time and time again. And one remote location    I first went there as a backpacker  I've been back several times for filming  most recently for Untamed Americas    it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America  and it's the most otherworldly place I know. But at        feet  it's tough. It's freezing cold  and that thin air really gets you. Sometimes it's hard to breathe  especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment. And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover. But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity. Have a look. between Chile and Bolivia  the Andes completely change. It's called the Altiplano  or  high plains     a place of extremes and extreme contrasts. Where deserts freeze and waters boil. More like Mars than Earth  it seems just as hostile to life. The stars themselves    at        feet  the dry  thin air makes for perfect stargazing. Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby. But just looking up with the naked eye  you really don't need one. KB  Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent  wonderful Earth. Thank you for letting me share that with you. I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. I'd like you to notice the color of the door  the material that it's made out of. Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. They are competing in a naked bicycle race  and they are headed straight for your front door. I need you to actually see this. They are pedaling really hard  they're sweaty  they're bouncing around a lot. And they crash straight into the front door of your home. Bicycles fly everywhere  wheels roll past you  spokes end up in awkward places. Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer  your hallway  whatever's on the other side  and appreciate the quality of the light. The light is shining down on Cookie Monster. Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. It's a talking horse. You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. Walk past him. Walk past him into your living room. In your living room  in full imaginative broadband  picture Britney Spears. She is scantily clad  she's dancing on your coffee table  and she's singing  Hit Me Baby One More Time.  And then  follow me into your kitchen. In your kitchen  the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road  and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy  the Tin Man  the Scarecrow and the Lion from  The Wizard of Oz   hand in hand  skipping straight towards you. Okay. Open your eyes. I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City. It's called the United States Memory Championship. And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist  expecting  I guess  that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants. This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers  looking at them just once. They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. I was like  this is unbelievable. These people must be freaks of nature. And I started talking to a few of the competitors. This is a guy called Ed Cook  who had come over from England  where he had one of the best trained memories. And I said to him   Ed  when did you realize that you were a savant   And Ed was like   I'm not a savant. In fact  I have just an average memory. Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques  techniques invented       years ago in Greece  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books.  And I said   Whoa. How come I never heard of this before   And we were standing outside the competition hall  and Ed  who is a wonderful  brilliant  but somewhat eccentric English guy  says to me   Josh  you're an American journalist. Do you know Britney Spears   I'm like   What  No. Why    Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television. It will prove to the world that anybody can do this.  I was like   Well  I'm not Britney Spears  but maybe you could teach me. I mean  you've got to start somewhere  right   And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory  but also investigating it  trying to understand how it works  why it sometimes doesn't work  and what its potential might be. And I met a host of really interesting people. This is a guy called E.P. He's an amnesic who had  very possibly  the worst memory in the world. His memory was so bad  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem  which is amazing. And he was this incredibly tragic figure  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. At the other end of the spectrum  I met this guy. This is Kim Peek  he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie  Rain Man.  We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books  which was scintillating. And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises  treatises written       plus years ago in Latin  in antiquity  and then later  in the Middle Ages. And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time  this idea of having a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. Once upon a time  people invested in their memories  in laboriously furnishing their minds. Over the last few millenia  we've invented a series of technologies    from the alphabet  to the scroll  to the codex  the printing press  photography  the computer  the smartphone    that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. These technologies have made our modern world possible  but they've also changed us. They've changed us culturally  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. Having little need to remember anymore  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory  is at this totally singular memory contest. It's actually not that singular  there are contests held all over the world. And I was fascinated  I wanted to know how do these guys do it. A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. They wanted to know  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally  anatomically different from the rest of ours  The answer was no. Are they smarter than the rest of us  They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests  and the answer was  not really. There was  however  one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. When they put these guys in an fMRI machine  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. Of note  they were using  or they seemed to be using  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. Why  And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this  The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where  every year  somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly  and then the rest of the field has to play catch up. This is my friend Ben Pridmore  three time world memory champion. On his desk in front of him are    shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of       random binary digits in half an hour. Yeah. And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions  everything  all of the techniques that are being used  ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as  elaborative encoding.  And it's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker baker paradox  which goes like this  If I tell two people to remember the same word  if I say to you   Remember that there is a guy named Baker.  That's his name. And I say to you   Remember that there is a guy who is a baker.  Okay  And I come back to you at some point later on  and I say   Do you remember that word that I told you a while back  Do you remember what it was   The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker. Same word  different amount of remembering  that's weird. What's going on here  Well  the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. But the common noun  baker     we know bakers. Bakers wear funny white hats. Bakers have flour on their hands. Bakers smell good when they come home from work. Maybe we even know a baker. And when we first hear that word  we start putting these associational hooks into it  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower case B bakers    to take information that is lacking in context  in significance  in meaning  and transform it in some way  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back       years to Ancient Greece. It came to be known as the memory palace. The story behind its creation goes like this  There was a poet called Simonides  who was attending a banquet. He was actually the hired entertainment  because back then  if you wanted to throw a really slamming party  you didn't hire a D.J.  you hired a poet. And he stands up  delivers his poem from memory  walks out the door  and at the moment he does  the banquet hall collapses. Kills everybody inside. It doesn't just kill everybody  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. Nobody can say who was inside  nobody can say where they were sitting. The bodies can't be properly buried. It's one tragedy compounding another. Simonides  standing outside  the sole survivor amid the wreckage  closes his eyes and has this realization  which is that in his mind's eye  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. And he takes the relatives by the hand  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. What Simonides figured out at that moment  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know  which is that  as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers  and word for word instructions from our colleagues  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. If I asked you to recount the first    words of the story that I just told you about Simonides  chances are you would have a tough time with it. But  I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now  you would be able to see that. The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember    the crazier  weirder  more bizarre  funnier  raunchier  stinkier the image is  the more unforgettable it's likely to be. This is advice that goes back       plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises. So how does this work  Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech  and you want to do it from memory  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it  if he had been invited to TEDxRome       years ago. What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. And you'd come up with some sort of crazy  ridiculous  unforgettable image  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. And then you'd go inside your house  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed. And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook. And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. And you'd go into your kitchen  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that. This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches    not word for word  which is just going to screw you up  but topic for topic. In fact  the phrase  topic sentence     that comes from the Greek word  topos   which means  place.  That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. The phrase  in the first place   that's like  in the first place of your memory palace.  I thought this was just fascinating  and I got really into it. And I went to a few more of these memory contests  and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. But there was a problem. The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. Truly  it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs    I mean  the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. And I'm a journalist  I need something to write about. I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds  but I don't have access to it. And I realized  if I was going to tell this story  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. And so I started trying to spend    or    minutes every morning  before I sat down with my New York Times  just trying to remember something. Maybe it was a poem  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market. And I found that this was shockingly fun. I never would have expected that. It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. What you're doing  is you're trying to get better and better at creating  at dreaming up  these utterly ludicrous  raunchy  hilarious  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. And I got pretty into it. This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier  and I had this notion that I might enter it  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. It'd make  I thought  maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. Problem was  the experiment went haywire. I won the contest    which really wasn't supposed to happen. Now  it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists  but it's actually kind of beside the point. These are just tricks. They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift  but that is not the case. Great memories are learned. At the most basic level  we remember when we pay attention. We remember when we are deeply engaged. We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience  and figure out why it is meaningful to us  why it is significant  why it's colorful  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers. The memory palace  these memory techniques    they're just shortcuts. In fact  they're not even really shortcuts. They work because they make you work. They force a kind of depth of processing  a kind of mindfulness  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. But there actually are no shortcuts. This is how stuff is made memorable. And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with  it's what E.P.  the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem  left me with  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries  our iPhones  by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply  I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. But if you want to live a memorable life  you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. Thank you. So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a     page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it. But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a     page actually is. The     page is that. It's that broken experience on the Web. It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it. And it serves you the     page. It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it. And I just want you to think a little bit about  remember for yourself  it's annoying when you hit this thing. Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship. And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about  where does     come from  It's from a family of errors actually    a whole set of relationship errors  which  when I started digging into them  it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor. You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey. Yes. But these things are everywhere. They're on sites big  they're on sites small. This is a global experience. What a     page tells you is that you fell through the cracks. And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this. You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone. A     page is not what you're looking for. You get that  and it's like a slap in the face. Trying to think about how a     felt  and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk. And you say   Hey  could you bring the skim milk   And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on. And you're like   Oh  I didn't want to see that.  That's the     feeling. I mean  I've heard about that. So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator  and we had eight startups sitting around there. And those startups are focused on what they are  not what they're not  until one day Athletepath  which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes  found this video. Crowd  Whoa  Renny Gleeson  You just ... no  he's not okay. They took that video and they embedded it in their     page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place. Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a    . So this turned into a contest. Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their     page. Stayhound  which helps you find pet sitters through your social network  commiserated with your pet. Each one of them found this. It turned into a    hour contest. At      the next day  we gave out      in cash. And what they learned was that those little things  done right  actually matter  and that well designed moments can build brands. So you take a look out in the real world  and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself. You can type in an URL and put in a     and these will pop. This is one that commiserates with you. This is one that blames you. This is one that I loved. This is an error page  but what if this error page was also an opportunity  So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be. Because back to the whole relationship issue  what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not  or it can remind me of why I should love you. Thank you. Gotcha. Mosquitos. I hate them. Don't you  That awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy  Knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood  That's awful  right  In fact  there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitos. When they fly into our bedroom at night  they prefer to bite my wife. But that's fascinating  right  Why does she receive more bites than I do  And the answer is smell  the smell of her body. And since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos  some of us are just more attractive than others. So my wife smells nicer than I do  or I just stink more than she does. Either way  mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us. And during my Ph.D  I wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used  African malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night. And there's a whole range of compounds that they do use. And this was not going to be an easy task. And therefore  we set up various experiments. Why did we set up these experiments  Because half the world's population runs the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria through a simple mosquito bite. Every    seconds  somewhere on this planet  a child dies of malaria  and Paul Levy this morning  he was talking about the metaphor of the     crashing into the United States. Well  in Africa  we have the equivalent of seven jumbo    s crashing every day. But perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps  bait it with our smell  we may be able to stop transmission of disease. Now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing  because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin  but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed. First  we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body. Strange. So we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage  and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person. And we found some remarkable differences. On the left here you see the bites by the Dutch malarial mosquito on this person. They had a very strong preference for biting on the face. In contrast  the African malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person  and that of course we should have known all along because they're called mosqui toes  you see   Laughter  That's right.  Applause  And so we started focusing on the smell of feet  on the smell of human feet  until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse. Think of it. And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment. We tried  with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese  which smells badly after feet  to attract African malaria mosquitos. And you know what  It worked. In fact  it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans. Limburg  be proud of your cheese  as it is now used in the fight against malaria. That's the cheese  just to show you. My second story is remarkable as well. It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs. And I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria. One of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease. It's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae. Why  Because they are just like the CIA. In that pool of water  these larvae are concentrated. They're all together there. They are immobile. They can't escape from that water. They can't fly. And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there  right  So the problem that we face with this is that  throughout the landscape  all these pools of water with the larvae  they are scattered all over the place  which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides. And last year we thought very  very hard  how can we resolve this problem  Until we realized that just like us  we have a unique smell  that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell. And so we set up another crazy experiment  because we collected the smell of these larvae  put it on pieces of cloth  and then did something very remarkable. Here we have a bar with four holes  and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole. Ooh  that was very quick. And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie. He's examining these holes  and now he's got it already. He's going back to check the control holes again  but he's coming back to the first one  and now he's locking into that smell  which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field  and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria. This lady is Ellen van der Zweep. She's one of the best dog trainers in the world  and she believes that we can do a lot more. Since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected  she's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite. That means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way  and there's few people remaining with parasites  that the dogs can find these people  we can treat them with anti malarial drugs  and give the final blow to malaria. Man's best friend in the fight against malaria. My third story is perhaps even more remarkable  and  I should say  has never been shown to the public until today. Yeah. It's a crazy story  but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever. In fact  people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos. And the question of course is  what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos  And the answer I have right here in my pocket  if I get it. It's a tablet  a simple tablet  and when I take it with water  it does miracles. Thank you. Now let me show you how this works. Here in this box I have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that I'm just about to release.  Laughter  Just kidding  just kidding. What I'm going to show you is I'm gonna stick my arm into it and I will show you how quickly they will bite. Here we go. Don't worry  I do this all the time in the lab. There we go. Okay. Now  on the video  on the video here  I'm going to show you exactly the same thing  except that what I'm showing you on the video happened one hour after I took the tablet. Have a look. That doesn't work. Okay. Sorry about that. I'm sticking in my arm  I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal  I'm shaking them off  and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very  very sick indeed  here shown in fast motion  and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos  very dead mosquitos  and I'm going to say  ladies and gentlemen  we have swapped the cards with mosquitos. They don't kill us. We kill them. Now    Laughter    Maastricht  be prepared. Now think of what we can do with this. We can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases  of epidemics  right  And better still  imagine what would happen if  in a very large area  everyone would take these drugs  this drug  for just three weeks. That would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease. So cheese  dogs and a pill to kill mosquitos. That's the kind of out of the box science that I love doing  for the betterment of mankind  but especially for her  so that she can grow up in a world without malaria. Thank you.  Applause  I'm going to talk to you about optimism    or more precisely  the optimism bias. It's a cognitive illusion that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years  and    percent of us have it. It's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events. So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer  being in a car accident. We overestimate our longevity  our career prospects. In short  we're more optimistic than realistic  but we are oblivious to the fact. Take marriage for example. In the Western world  divorce rates are about    percent. That means that out of five married couples  two will end up splitting their assets. But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce  they estimate it at zero percent. And even divorce lawyers  who should really know better  hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce. So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce  but they are more likely to remarry. In the words of Samuel Johnson   Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience.  So if we're married  we're more likely to have kids. And we all think our kids will be especially talented. This  by the way  is my two year old nephew  Guy. And I just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias  because he is in fact uniquely talented. And I'm not alone. Out of four British people  three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families. That's    percent. But only    percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago. And this is a really important point  because we're optimistic about ourselves  we're optimistic about our kids  we're optimistic about our families  but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us  and we're somewhat pessimistic about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country. But private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent. And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay  but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so. Now I'm a scientist  I do experiments. So to show you what I mean  I'm going to do an experiment here with you. So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics  and I want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population. The first one is getting along well with others. Who here believes they're at the bottom    percent  Okay  that's about    people out of      . Who believes they're at the top    percent  That's most of us here. Okay  now do the same for your driving ability. How interesting are you  How attractive are you  How honest are you  And finally  how modest are you  So most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities. Now this is statistically impossible. We can't all be better than everyone else. But if we believe we're better than the other guy  well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion  to remain married  because we're more social  more interesting. And it's a global phenomenon. The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries    in Western cultures  in non Western cultures  in females and males  in kids  in the elderly. It's quite widespread. But the question is  is it good for us  So some people say no. Some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations. I think the logic goes something like this  If we don't expect greatness  if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful  well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen. And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen  and we're pleasantly surprised when they do  we will be happy. So it's a very good theory  but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons. Number one  Whatever happens  whether you succeed or you fail  people with high expectations always feel better. Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month depends on how we interpret that event. The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown studied students with high and low expectations. And they found that when people with high expectations succeed  they attribute that success to their own traits.  I'm a genius  therefore I got an A  therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future.  When they failed  it wasn't because they were dumb  but because the exam just happened to be unfair. Next time they will do better. People with low expectations do the opposite. So when they failed it was because they were dumb  and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy. Next time reality would catch up with them. So they felt worse. Number two  Regardless of the outcome  the pure act of anticipation makes us happy. The behavioral economist George Lowenstein asked students in his university to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity  any celebrity. Then he said   How much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately  in three hours  in    hours  in three days  in one year  in    years  He found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately  but to get a kiss in three days. They were willing to pay extra in order to wait. Now they weren't willing to wait a year or    years  no one wants an aging celebrity. But three days seemed to be the optimum amount. So why is that  Well if you get the kiss now  it's over and done with. But if you get the kiss in three days  well that's three days of jittery anticipation  the thrill of the wait. The students wanted that time to imagine where is it going to happen  how is it going to happen. Anticipation made them happy. This is  by the way  why people prefer Friday to Sunday. It's a really curious fact  because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure  so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday  but they don't. It's not because they really  really like being in the office and they can't stand strolling in the park or having a lazy brunch. We know that  because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week  surprise  surprise  Saturday comes in at first  then Friday  then Sunday. People prefer Friday because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead  all the plans that you have. On Sunday  the only thing you can look forward to is the work week. So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future  more strolls in the park. And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing. In fact  without the optimism bias  we would all be slightly depressed. People with mild depression  they don't have a bias when they look into the future. They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals. But individuals with severe depression  they have a pessimistic bias. So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being. So optimism changes subjective reality. The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it. But it also changes objective reality. It acts as a self fulfilling prophecy. And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy. Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success  it leads to success. Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics. And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health. If we expect the future to be bright  stress and anxiety are reduced. So all in all  optimism has lots of benefits. But the question that was really confusing to me was  how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality  As an neuroscientist  this was especially confusing  because according to all the theories out there  when your expectations are not met  you should alter them. But this is not what we find. We asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on. We asked them to estimate their likelihood of experiencing different terrible events in their lives. So  for example  what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer  And then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes. So cancer  for example  is about    percent. And then we asked them again   How likely are you to suffer from cancer   What we wanted to know was whether people will take the information that we gave them to change their beliefs. And indeed they did    but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they expected. So for example  if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. The average likelihood is only    percent   the next time around they would say   Well maybe my likelihood is about    percent.  So they learned quickly and efficiently. But if someone started off saying   My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about    percent   and we said   Hey  bad news. The average likelihood is about    percent   the next time around they would say   Yep. Still think it's about    percent.  So it's not that they didn't learn at all    they did    but much  much less than when we gave them positive information about the future. And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them  everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about    percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about    percent. But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them. What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact. Yes  smoking kills  but mostly it kills the other guy. What I wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally. But at the same time  when we hear that the housing market is hopeful  we think   Oh  my house is definitely going to double in price.  To try and figure that out  I asked the participants in the experiment to lie in a brain imaging scanner. It looks like this. And using a method called functional MRI  we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information. One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus. So if someone said   My likelihood of suffering from cancer is    percent   and we said   Hey  good news. Average likelihood is    percent   the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely. And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist  a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic  everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well  whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen. On the other side of the brain  the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news. And here's the thing  it wasn't doing a very good job. The more optimistic you were  the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information. And if your brain is failing at integrating bad news about the future  you will constantly leave your rose tinted spectacles on. So we wanted to know  could we change this  Could we alter people's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions  And there's a way for us to do that. This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai. And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus. And by doing that  he's interfering with the activity of this brain region for about half an hour. After that everything goes back to normal  I assure you. So let's see what happens. First of all  I'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see. So if I was to test all of you now  this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news. Now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task  and the optimism bias grew even larger. We made people more biased in the way that they process information. Then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task  and the optimism bias disappeared. We were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in humans. And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves  would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits  If we could do that  would we want to take people's optimism bias away  Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias  which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life. But there are  of course  pitfalls  and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them. Take for example this email I recieved from a firefighter here in California. He says   Fatality investigations for firefighters often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that ' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions.  This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do  to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans. So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior  to financial collapse  to faulty planning. The British government  for example  has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects. So they have adjusted the      Olympic budget for the optimism bias. My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget. And by the way  when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce  he said he was quite sure it was zero percent. So what we would really like to do  is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful  benefiting from the many fruits of optimism. And I believe there's a way for us to do that. The key here really is knowledge. We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases. These have to be identified by scientific investigation. But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion. It's like visual illusions  in which understanding them does not make them go away. And this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance  to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism  but at the same time remain hopeful. I think this cartoon portrays it nicely. Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly  you certainly never will. Because to make any kind of progress  we need to be able to imagine a different reality  and then we need to believe that that reality is possible. But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best  you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground. But if you're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly  but then adjusts a parachute to your back just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned  you will soar like an eagle  even if you're just a penguin. Thank you. So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language. It has generated considerable insight in physics  in biology and economics  but not that much in the humanities and in history. I think there's a belief that it's just impossible  that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind  that you cannot measure history. But I don't think that's right. I want to show you a couple of examples why. So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact  that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language. That's a powerful historical force. So the king of England  Alfred the Great  will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop  Jay Z. Now it's just the way it is. Language changes over time  and it's a powerful force. So Erez and I wanted to know more about that. So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule  past tense conjugation. So you just add  ed  to a verb at the end to signify the past.  Today I walk. Yesterday I walked.  But some verbs are irregular.  Yesterday I thought.  Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay Z have become more regular. Like the verb  to wed  that you see here has become regular. So Erez and I followed the fate of over     irregular verbs through    centuries of English language  and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change  namely  if a verb is     times more frequent than another  it regularizes    times slower. That's a piece of history  but it comes in a mathematical wrapping. Now in some cases math can even help explain  or propose explanations for  historical forces. So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries. There's actually a well known regularity to them where the number of wars that are     times deadlier is    times smaller. So there are    wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War  but there's only four wars that are     times deadlier    like World War I. So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that  What's the origin of this  So Steve and I  through mathematical analysis  propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this  which lies in our brains. This is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways    quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound. For instance  committing        soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot. It's relatively enormous if you've already committed       soldiers previously. But it doesn't sound so much  it's not relatively enough  it won't make a difference if you've already committed         soldiers previously. So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities  as the war drags on  the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly    like                           but exponentially            later         later       . And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before. So here mathematics is able to link a well known feature of the individual mind with a long term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents. So these types of examples  today there are just a few of them  but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace. The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace. So there's about     million books that have been written since the dawn of time. Companies like Google have digitized many of them    above    million actually. And when the stuff of history is available in digital form  it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture. So I think in the next decade  the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind. And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that. It will be able to reveal new trends in our history  sometimes to explain them  and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen. Thank you very much. I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence. I'm going to start way back in the third grade at Oakdale School in Barberton  Ohio. I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project. He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink. And at one point  one of the girls who was sitting at his table  seeing what he was doing  leaned over and said to him   That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse.  And Brian's shoulders sank. And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin. I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again. And I wonder how often that happens. It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class  a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience  how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them. And some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point. And I see that opting out that happens in childhood  and it moves in and becomes more ingrained  even by the time you get to adult life. So we see a lot of this. When we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side  eventually we get to the point in the process that's fuzzy or unconventional. And eventually these bigshot executives whip out their Blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls  and they head for the exits. And they're just so uncomfortable. When we track them down and ask them what's going on  they say something like   I'm just not the creative type.  But we know that's not true. If they stick with the process  if they stick with it  they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are. So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have. That you don't do things  you're afraid you're going to be judged. If you don't say the right creative thing  you're going to be judged. And I had a major breakthrough when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura. I don't know if you know Albert Bandura. But if you go to Wikipedia  it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history    like Freud  Skinner  somebody and Bandura. Bandura's    and he still works at Stanford. And he's just a lovely guy. And so I went to see him because he has just worked on phobias for a long time  which I'm very interested in. He had developed this way  this kind of methodology  that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time. In four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias. And we talked about snakes. I don't know why we talked about snakes. We talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia. And it was really enjoyable  really interesting. He told me that he'd invite the test subject in  and he'd say   You know  there's a snake in the next room and we're going to go in there.  To which  he reported  most of them replied   Hell no  I'm not going in there  certainly if there's a snake in there.  But Bandura has a step by step process that was super successful. So he'd take people to this two way mirror looking into the room where the snake was  and he'd get them comfortable with that. And then through a series of steps  he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open and they'd be looking in there. And he'd get them comfortable with that. And then many more steps later  baby steps  they'd be in the room  they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on  and they'd eventually touch the snake. And when they touched the snake everything was fine. They were cured. In fact  everything was better than fine. These people who had life long fears of snakes were saying things like   Look how beautiful that snake is.  And they were holding it in their laps. Bandura calls this process  guided mastery.  I love that term  guided mastery. And something else happened  these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives. They tried harder  they persevered longer  and they were more resilient in the face of failure. They just gained a new confidence. And Bandura calls that confidence self efficacy    the sense that you can change the world and that you can attain what you set out to do. Well meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me because I realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we've seen happen for the last    years. That we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative  and we could take them through a series of steps  kind of like a series of small successes  and they turn fear into familiarity  and they surprise themselves. That transformation is amazing. We see it at the d.school all the time. People from all different kinds of disciplines  they think of themselves as only analytical. And they come in and they go through the process  our process  they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently. And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person. So I thought one of the things I'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like. To me  that journey looks like Doug Dietz. Doug Dietz is a technical person. He designs medical imaging equipment  large medical imaging equipment. He's worked for GE  and he's had a fantastic career. But at one point he had a moment of crisis. He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use when he saw a young family. There was a little girl  and that little girl was crying and was terrified. And Doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly    percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine. And this was really disappointing to Doug  because before this time he was proud of what he did. He was saving lives with this machine. But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids. About that time he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes. He was learning about our process about design thinking  about empathy  about iterative prototyping. And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary. He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned. And this is what he came up with. He turned it into an adventure for the kids. He painted the walls and he painted the machine  and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids  like children's museum people. And now when the kid comes  it's an experience. And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship. And when they come  they say   Okay  you're going to go into the pirate ship  but be very still because we don't want the pirates to find you.  And the results were super dramatic. So from something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated  to something like    percent of the kids needing to be sedated. And the hospital and GE were happy too. Because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time  they could put more kids through the machine in a day. So the quantitative results were great. But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative. He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan. And when the little girl came out of her scan  she ran up to her mother and said   Mommy  can we come back tomorrow   And so I've heard Doug tell the story many times  of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it  but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye. Doug's story takes place in a hospital. I know a thing or two about hospitals. A few years ago I felt a lump on the side of my neck  and it was my turn in the MRI machine. It was cancer. It was the bad kind. I was told I had a    percent chance of survival. So while you're sitting around with the other patients in your pajamas and everybody's pale and thin and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays  you think of a lot of things. Mostly you think about  Am I going to survive  And I thought a lot about  What was my daughter's life going to be like without me  But you think about other things. I thought a lot about  What was I put on Earth to do  What was my calling  What should I do  And I was lucky because I had lots of options. We'd been working in health and wellness  and K through     and the Developing World. And so there were lots of projects that I could work on. But I decided and I committed to at this point to the thing I most wanted to do    was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way. And if I was going to survive  that's what I wanted to do. I survived  just so you know. I really believe that when people gain this confidence    and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO    they actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives. We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions. We see them come up with more interesting  and just more  ideas so they can choose from better ideas. And they just make better decisions. So I know at TED you're supposed to have a change the world kind of thing. Everybody has a change the world thing. If there is one for me  this is it. To help this happen. So I hope you'll join me on my quest    you as thought leaders. It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non creatives  like it's some God given thing  and to have people realize that they're naturally creative. And those natural people should let their ideas fly. That they should achieve what Bandura calls self efficacy  that you can do what you set out to do  and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake. Thank you. This is a thousand year old drawing of the brain. It's a diagram of the visual system. And some things look very familiar today. Two eyes at the bottom  optic nerve flowing out from the back. There's a very large nose that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular. And if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system  you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years. And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain  rather than just looking at its overall shape. Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard  a mouse  a screen. You really would be kind of out of luck. You want to be able to open it up  crack it open  look at the wiring inside. And up until a little more than a century ago  nobody was able to do that with the brain. Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring. And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it  put it under even a very powerful microscope  there's nothing there. It's gray  formless. There's no structure. It won't tell you anything. And this all changed in the late   th century. Suddenly  new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring. The computer was cracked open. So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain. And it works in a very particular way. Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue  it somehow only stains about one percent of them. It clears the forest  reveals the trees inside. If everything had been labeled  nothing would have been visible. So somehow it shows what's there. Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal  who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience  applied this Golgi stain  which yields data which looks like this  and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell  the neuron. And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer  this is the transistor. And very quickly Cajal realized that neurons don't operate alone  but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer. Today  a century later  when researchers want to visualize neurons  they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them. And there's several ways of doing this. But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein. Now green fluorescent protein  which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish  is very useful. Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell  that cell will glow green    or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein  you get a cell to glow many different colors. And so coming back to the brain  this is from a genetically engineered mouse called  Brainbow.  And it's so called  of course  because all of these neurons are glowing different colors. Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify individual molecular components of neurons  molecules  rather than the entire cell. And there's several ways of doing this  but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies. And you're familiar  of course  with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system. But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules  like  for example  the coat protein of a virus that's invading the body. And researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain  recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually. And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful  but they're also very powerful. They have great explanatory power. This  for example  is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain. And you've heard of serotonin  of course  in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety. You've heard of SSRIs  which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases. And in order to understand how serotonin works  it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is. And antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question. I'd like to leave you with the following thought  Green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get go. They were evolved by nature in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason  or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus  for example. And only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say   Hey  these are tools  these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette.  And instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch  there were these ready made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all. Thank you. Twelve years ago  I was in the street writing my name to say   I exist.  Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say   They exist.  From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine  the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio  paper and glue    as easy as that. I asked a question last year  Can art change the world  Well let me tell you  in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year  because the Arab Spring is still spreading  the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else  The Occupy movement found a voice  and I still have to speak English constantly. So there has been a lot of change. So when I had my TED wish last year  I said  look  I'm going to switch my concept. You are going to take the photos. You're going to send them to me. I'm going to print them and send them back to you. Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement. This is Inside Out. One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year. Those are the kind of posters  let me show you. And we keep sending more every day. This is the size. Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it. This one was from Haiti. When I launched my wish last year  hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us. But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked  no credit  no logos  no sponsoring. A week later  a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world. These are the people I want to talk about to you today. Two weeks after my speech  in Tunisia  hundreds of portraits were made. And they pasted  over  every single portrait of the dictator  with  their own photos. Boom  This is what happened. Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country. They really make Inside Out their own project. Actually  that photo was pasted in a police station  and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police. Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia. He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say   We have rights.  They used Inside Out as a platform for protest. Karachi  Pakistan. Sharmeen is actually here. She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town. And I want to thank her today. North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation  in this Turtle Island   unclear name  from the Dakota Lakota tribe wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here. The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights. He pasted up portraits all over his reservation. And he's here also today. Each time I get a wall in New York  I use his photos to continue spreading the project. Juarez  You've heard of the border    one of the most dangerous borders in the world. Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border. Do you know what it takes to do this  People  energy  make the glue  organize the team. It was amazing. While in Iran at the same time Abololo    of course a nickname    has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government. I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action. There are tons of school projects. Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools. Education is so essential. Kids just make photos in a class  the teacher receives them  they paste them on the school. Here they even got the help of the firemen. There should be even more schools doing this kind of project. Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine. So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck. You go on the back of that truck  it takes your photo     seconds later take it from the side  you're ready to rock. Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two state peace solution and then walk in the street. This is march  the         march    beginning of September. They were all holding their photo as a statement. On the other side  people were wrapping up streets  buildings. It's everywhere. Come on  don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there. These projects took thousands of actions in one year  making hundreds of thousands of people participating  creating millions of views. This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on. So back to the question   Can art change the world   Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning. But maybe we should change the question. Can art change people's lives  From what I've seen this year  yes. And you know what  It's just the beginning. Let's turn the world inside out together. Thank you. So  I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit. Forty two million people were displaced by natural disasters in     . Now  there was nothing particularly special about       because  on average     and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year. Now  usually when people hear statistics or stats like that  you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas  but it happens right here in the United States every single year. Last year alone     federally declared disasters were on file with FEMA  from Joplin  Missouri  and Tuscaloosa  Alabama  to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently. Now  how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people  They cram them onto cots  put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag  stick it underneath  and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena  or a gymnasium. So obviously there's a massive housing gap  and this really upset me  because academia tells you after a major disaster  there's typically about an    month time frame to    we kinda recover  start the recovery process  but what most people don't realize is that on average it takes    to    days or more for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up. Before that time  people are left to their own devices. So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap. This actually became my creative obsession. I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem. So I started sketching. Two days after Katrina  I started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this  and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form  I started sketching digitally on the computer  but it was an obsession  so I couldn't just stop there. I started experimenting  making models  talking to experts in the field  taking their feedback  and refining  and I kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years. Now  my obsession ended up driving me to create full size prototypes in my own backyard    Laughter    and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and a variety of other costs  but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster. It can be put up in any environment  from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields  because it doesn't require any special setup or specialty tools. Now  at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit  which is just the individual shelter module. And though it's light  light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around  and it actually sleeps four people. And you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout  or you can circle the wagons  essentially  and form these circular pods out of them  which give you this semi private communal area for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually trapped inside these units. Now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters  because gone are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium  where people are crammed on these cots inside. Now we have instant neighborhoods outside. So the Exo is designed to be simply  basically like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them. In fact     Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself. This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today. But I'm obsessive  so I couldn't just stop there  so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving  so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location. The doors can actually swap out  so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control  or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together  which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces  so now this same kit of parts  this same unit can actually serve as a living room  bedroom or bathroom  or an office  a living space and secure storage. Sounds like a great idea  but how do you make it real  So the first idea I had  initially  was just to go the federal and state governments and go   Here  take it  for free.  But I was quickly told that   Boy  our government doesn't really work like that.   Laughter  Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going along with the government  but then I was told   Son  our government looks to private sector for things like this.  Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it  but I was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit because they didn't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of Haiti. Now  I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged.  Laughter.  So I decided  kind of told myself   Oh yeah  Watch this. I'll do it myself.   Laughter  Now  this quickly  my day job sent me to work out of our Milan office for a few months  so I was like  what will I do  So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar  and spent the   hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers  manufacturers and potential customers. And we found through this whole process  we found this great little manufacturer in Virginia  and if his body language is any indication  that's the owner    Laughter    of what it's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer  you've got to see what happens here.  Laughter  But G.S. Industries was fantastic. They actually built three prototypes for us by hand. So now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide. And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us. Now  a funny thing started happening. Other people started to believe in what we were doing  and actually offered us hangar space  donated hangar space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. So now we had a hangar space to work in  and prototypes to demo with. So in one year  we've negotiated manufacturing agreements  been awarded one patent  filed our second patent  talked to multiple people  demoed this to FEMA and its consultants to rave reviews  and then started talking to some other people who requested information  this little group called the United Nations. And on top of that  now we have a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps  mobile youth hostels  right down to the World Cup and the Olympics. So  in closing  on this whole thing here is hopefully very soon we will not have to respond to these painful phone calls that we get after disasters where we don't really have anything to sell or give you yet. Hopefully very soon we will be there  because we are destined  obsessed with making it real. Thank you.  Applause  Recently I visited Beloit  Wisconsin. And I was there to honor a great   th century explorer  Roy Chapman Andrews. During his time at the American Museum of Natural History  Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions  like here in the Gobi Desert. He was quite a figure. He was later  it's said  the basis of the Indiana Jones character. And when I was in Beloit  Wisconsin  I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students. And I'm here to tell you  if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED  it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand    year olds for a    minute lecture. Don't try that one. At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions  but there was one that's really stuck with me since then. There was a young girl who stood up  and she asked the question   Where should we explore   I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over  that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. But is that really the case  Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth  It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology. This is an explorer of the unseen world  Martinus Beijerinck. So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease. What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters. And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known    bacteria  at the time. He came up with a name for his mystery agent. He called it the virus    Latin for  poison.  And in uncovering viruses  Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us. We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet  more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined. And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world    things like the eradication of smallpox  the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer  which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus. And Beijerinck's discovery  this was not something that occurred     years ago. It was a little over     years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses. So basically we had automobiles  but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world    things like deep sequencing  which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species  but to look at entire metagenomes  the communities of teeming microorganisms in  on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species. We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between. In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them. And just to give you a sense of how this works  imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you. And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza. The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. And if we started looking into that genetic information  we'd see a number of usual suspects out there    of course  a lot of human genetic information  but also bacterial and viral information  mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose. But we'd also see something very  very surprising. As we started to look at this information  we would see that about    percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before    no plant  animal  fungus  virus or bacteria. Basically we have no clue what this is. And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data  a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. We know it's not anything that we've seen before  it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information. And there's a lot of it. If you think    percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter  if we looked at your gut  up to    or    percent of that information is biological dark matter. And even in the relatively sterile blood  around one to two percent of this information is dark matter    can't be classified  can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before. At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact. These deep sequencing tools are relatively new. But as they become more and more accurate  we've determined that this information is a form of life  or at least some of it is a form of life. And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy  there's a very  very exciting possibility that exists  that buried in this life  in this genetic information  are signatures of as of yet unidentified life. That as we explore these strings of A's  T's  C's and G's  we may uncover a completely new class of life that  like Beijerinck  will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology. That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology. I'm pleased to announce that  along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF  we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life. A little over a hundred years ago  people were unaware of viruses  the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. A hundred years from now  people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses. It's true  we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there  but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth. Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers    people like that young girl from Beloit  Wisconsin. And I think if we phrase that lesson  it's something like this  Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore. There are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered. Thank you. I'm going to talk about religion. But it's a broad and very delicate subject  so I have to limit myself. And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality. This is a very serious talk. So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful. It's when the young couple whisper   Tonight we are going to make a baby.  My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman. This is indeed important  because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet. And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this    three billion in       seven billion just last year    and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies  and it may continue like this. To what extent are these people right  When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world  and today        there's almost two billion. What has happened since  and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century  This is a quiz. What do you think  Do you think it will decrease to one billion  Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century  Will the number of children increase each year up to    years  or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there  I will tell you by the end of my speech. But now  what does religion have to do with it  When you want to classify religion  it's more difficult than you think. You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this. It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion  but that's not detailed enough. So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia  we found this map. But that subdivides Christianity  Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups  which was too detailed. Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map  and it looks like this. Each country's a bubble. The size is the population    big China  big India here. And the color now is the majority religion. It's the religion where more than    percent of the people say that they belong. It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries. Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East  Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia. That's where we find Islamic majority. And Christian majority religions  we see in these countries. They are blue. And that is most countries in America and Europe  many countries in Africa and a few in Asia. The white here are countries which cannot be classified  because one religion does not reach    percent or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason. So we were careful with that. So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot. This is in     . And now I show the number of babies per woman here  two  four or six    many babies  few babies. And here the income per person in comparable dollars. The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies. So low income here  high income there. And indeed in       you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies. The exception was Japan. Japan here was regarded as an exception. Otherwise it was only Christian countries. But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman. But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa. And countries with Islam as the majority religion  all of them almost had six to seven children per woman  irregardless of the income level. And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level. Now let's see what has happened in the world. I start the world  and here we go. Now         can you see they're getting a little richer  but the number of babies per woman is falling  Look at China. They're falling fairly fast. And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down  as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range. And when we enter into this century  you'll find more than half of mankind down here. And by       we are actually    percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman. It's a quite amazing development which has happened. And these are countries from United States here  with         per capita  France  Russia  Iran  Mexico  Turkey  Algeria  Indonesia  India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam  which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman. I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries. We get that from the census data. It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful. So what we can conclude is you don't have to get rich to have few children. It has happened across the world. And then when we look at religions  we can see that the Eastern religions  indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children. Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity  you see countries all the way. But there's no major difference. There's no major difference between these religions. There is a difference with income. The countries which have many babies per woman here  they have quite low income. Most of them are in sub Saharan Africa. But there are also countries here like Guatemala  like Papua New Guinea  like Yemen and Afghanistan. Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo  which have suffered severe conflicts  that they don't have fast population growth. It's the other way around. In the world today  it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth. Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child. These countries have six children per woman. They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman. But    years from now  Afghanistan will go from    million to    million. Congo will go from    to    . That's where we have the fast population growth. And many think that these countries are stagnant  but they are not. Let me compare Senegal  a Muslim dominated country  with a Christian dominated country  Ghana. I take them backwards here to their independence  when they were up here in the beginning of the     s. Just look what they have done. It's an amazing improvement  from seven children per woman  they've gone all the way down to between four and five. It's a tremendous improvement. So what does it take  Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries. You need to have children to survive. You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family. You need to have access to some family planning. And you need the fourth factor  which perhaps is the most important factor. But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar. Here we have Qatar today  and there we have Bangladesh today. If I take these countries back to the years of their independence  which is almost the same year    '    '      it's a quite amazing development which had happened. Look at Bangladesh and Qatar. With so different incomes  it's almost the same drop in number of babies per woman. And what is the reason in Qatar  Well I do as I always do. I went to the statistical authority of Qatar  to their webpage    It's a very good webpage. I recommend it    and I looked up    oh yeah  you can have lots of fun here    and provided free of charge  I found Qatar's social trends. Very interesting. Lots to read. I found fertility at birth  and I looked at total fertility rate per woman. These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar  and they say the most important factors are   Increased age at first marriage  increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force.  I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more. This is a country that indeed has gone through a very  very interesting modernization. So what it is  is these four  Children should survive  children shouldn't be needed for work  women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible. Now look again at this. The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia    it's  .  today. There are countries up here which are very poor. And that's where family planning  better child survival is needed. I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk. And here  down  there are many countries which are less than two children per woman. So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz  it's two. We have reached peak child. The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. We are still debating peak oil  but we have definitely reached peak child. And the world population will stop growing. The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at    billion. But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow  Well I will show you here. I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came. They are quite useful for educational purposes. Each card box is one billion people. And there are two billion children in the world. There are two billion young people between    and   . These are rounded numbers. Then there is one billion between    and     almost one between    and   . And then it's my box. This is me     plus. We are here on top. So what will happen now is what we call  the big fill up.  You can see that it's like three billion missing here. They are not missing because they've died  they were never born. Because before       there were much fewer people born than there were during the last    years. So what will happen now is quite straightforward. The old  sadly  we will die. The rest of you  you will grow older and you will get two billion children. Then the old will die. The rest will grow older and get two billion children. And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children. This is the great fill up. It's inevitable. And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children  Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman. All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world. And we will be just    billion in this world  if the poorest people get out of poverty  their children survive  they get access to family planning. That is needed. But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more. So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future  for human beings on this planet  you have to plan for    billion. Thank you very much. This sound  this smell  this sight all remind me of the campfires of my childhood  when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames. There was this wondrous ending when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison. It was dreaming time. Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming  although I'm known to make my dreams come true. Last year  I created a one man show. For an hour and a half I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity  how I pursue perfection  how I cheat the impossible. And then TED challenged me   Philippe  can you shrink this lifetime to    minutes   Eighteen minutes  clearly impossible. But here I am. One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable  every second will have its importance and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me. No  no  no. No  the best way for me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity. So please join me for a minute of silence. Okay  I cheated  it was a mere    seconds. But hey  we're on TED time. When I was six years old  I fell in love with magic. For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box. So I looked in the book for the most difficult move  and it was this. Now I'm not supposed to share that with you  but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand. Now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages. One  two  three  four  five  six and seven. And let me show you something else. The cards were bigger than my hands. Two months later  six years old  I'm able to do one  two  three  four  five  six  seven. And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him   Well what do you think   Six years old. The magician looked at me and said   This is a disaster. You cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing. For the move to be professional  it has to be less than one second and it has to be perfect.  Two years later  one    zoop. And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect. Passion is the motto of all my actions. As I'm studying magic  juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination. Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly. So that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a juggler. I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe  and he agrees to sell me three clubs. But in America you have to explain. What are clubs  Nothing to do with golf. They are those beautiful oblong objects  but quite difficult to make. They have to be precisely lathed. Oh  when I was buying the clubs  somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others. Well I didn't think much of it at the time. Anyway  here I was progressing with my new clubs. But I could not understand. I was pretty fast  but I was not fluid at all. The clubs were escaping me at each throw. And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me. Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn  the world's greatest juggler. And he was frowning. And he finally asked   Can I see those   So I proudly showed him my clubs. He said   Philippe  you have been had. These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment. They are impossible to juggle.  Tenacity is how I kept at it against all odds. So I went to the circus to see more magicians  more jugglers  and I saw    oh no  no  no  I didn't see. It was more interesting  I heard. I heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air    the high wire walkers. Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood  so that's it. I'm     I'm becoming a wire walker. I found two trees    but not any kind of trees  trees with character    and then a very long rope. And I put the rope around and around and around and around and around till I had no more rope. Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this. I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers  and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path. So I just created the widest tightrope in the world. What did I need  I needed the widest shoes in the world. So I found some enormous  ridiculous  giant ski boots and then wobbly  wobbly I get on the ropes. Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing. So I cut one rope off. And the next day one rope off. And a few days later  I was practicing on a single tightrope. Now you can imagine at that time I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers. So that is how    in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try    this is how not to learn wire walking. Intuition is a tool essential in my life. In the meantime  I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers  I am my own teacher  progressing in my new art and becoming a street juggler. On the high wire  within months  I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus  except I am not satisfied. I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection. But nobody wanted to hire me. So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission. Notre Dame  the Sydney Harbor Bridge  the World Trade Center. And I developed a certitude  a faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side. If not  I will never do that first step. Well nonetheless  on the top of the World Trade Center my first step was terrifying. All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same. Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity. The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power I no longer feel. I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge. I step over the beam. I put my left foot on the cable  the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building. Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left  My right leg will be unburdened  my right foot will freely meet the wire. On one side  a mass of a mountain  a life I know. On the other  the universe of the clouds  so full of unknown we think it's empty. At my feet  the path to the north tower       yards of wire rope. It's a straight line  which sags  which sways  which vibrates  which rolls on itself  which is ice  which is three tons tight  ready to explode  ready to swallow me. An inner howl assails me  the wild longing to flee. But it is too late. The wire is ready. Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable. Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary. So after the walk people ask me   How can you top that   Well I didn't have that problem. I was not interested in collecting the gigantic  in breaking records. In fact  I put my World Trade Center crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks    or some completely different type of performance. Let's see  such as my street juggling  for example. So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter as the improvising comic silent character I created    years ago  I am as happy as when I am in the clouds. But this here  this is not the street. So I cannot street juggle here  you understand. So you don't want me to street juggle here  right  You know that  right  You don't want me to juggle  right  Thank you. Thank you. Each time I street juggle I use improvisation. Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown. And since what's impossible is always unknown  it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible. Now I have done the impossible not once  but many times. So what should I share  Oh  I know. Israel. Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high wire walk. And I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben Hinnom Valley. And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stopped and  like a magician  I produce a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace. Well now I must say  it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel  but I got one. And in my hotel room  each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air  she would graze the wall and end up on the bed. So I said  now it's okay. The room is too small. I mean  a bird needs space to fly. It will go perfectly on the day of the walk. Now comes the day of the walk. Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley. The mayor of Jerusalem  Teddy Kollek  comes to wish me the best. But he seemed nervous. There was tension in my wire  but I also could feel tension on the ground. Because all those people were made up of people who  for the most part  considered each other enemies. So I start the walk. Everything is fine. I stop in the middle. I make the dove appear. People applaud in delight. And then in the most magnificent gesture  I send the bird of peace into the azure. But the bird  instead of flying away  goes flop  flop  flop and lands on my head. And people scream. So I grab the dove  and for the second time I send her in the air. But the dove  who obviously didn't go to flying school  goes flop  flop  flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole. You laugh  you laugh. But hey. I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers. Now in the meantime  the audience  they go crazy. They must think this guy with this dove  he must have spent years working with him. What a genius  what a professional. So I take a bow. I salute with my hand. And at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird. Now the dove  who  now you know  obviously cannot fly  does for the third time a little flop  flop  flop and ends up on the wire behind me. And the entire valley goes crazy. Now but hold on  I'm not finished. So now I'm like    yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted  so my steps are slow. And something happened. Somebody somewhere  a group of people  starts clapping in rhythm with my steps. And within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps. But not an applause of delight like before  an applause encouragement. For a moment  the entire crowd had forgotten their differences. They had become one  pushing me to triumph. I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony. So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival. So I walk  you clap  everybody in unison. So after the walk  Teddy and I become friends. And he tells me  he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head. He didn't know the true story. And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard to manage city  instead of giving up  he looks at the picture and he says   If Philippe can do that  I can do this   and he goes back to work. Inspiration. By inspiring ourselves we inspire others. I will never forget this music  and I hope now neither will you. Please take this music with you home  and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly  and look at the world from a different perspective. And when you see mountains  remember mountains can be moved. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let's begin with a story. Once upon a time    well actually less than two years ago    in a kingdom not so very far away  there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown    an internationally famous company. Let's call it Island Networks. Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions  but the one thing it lacked was people. And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation. But in order to enter and to stay these migrants had to pass a few tests. And so it was  our man presented himself to authorities in the kingdom  looking forward to settling into his new life. But then something unexpected happened. The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man never actually told him what they were testing for. He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test  which is best medical practice. He was never informed of the results of the test. And yet  a couple of weeks later  he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subjected to a medical exam  including a full body search in full view of the others in the cell. He was released  but then a day or two later  he was taken to the airport and he was deported. What on earth did this man do to merit this treatment  What was his terrible crime  He was infected with HIV. Now the kingdom is one of about    countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV. The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state. But these laws  when applied to people living with HIV  are a violation of international human rights agreements to which these countries are signatories. But you know what  Matters of principle aside  practically speaking  these laws drive HIV underground. People are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition  none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect. Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV. And with treatment  it is a manageable condition. We are very far from the days when the only practical response to dread disease was to have banished the afflicted    like this   The Exile of the Leper.  So you tell me why  in our age of science  we still have laws and policies which come from an age of superstition. Time for a quick show of hands. Who here has been touched by HIV    either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with HIV  Hands up. Wow. Wow. That's a significant number of us. You know better than anyone that HIV brings out the best and the worst in humanity. And the laws reflect these attitudes. I'm not just talking about laws on the books  but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts. And I'm not just talking about laws as they relate to people living with HIV  but people who are at greatest risk of infection    people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers or men who have sex with men or transgendered persons or migrants or prisoners. And in many parts of the world that includes women and children who are especially vulnerable. Now there are laws in many parts of the world which reflect the best of human nature. These laws treat people touched by HIV with compassion and acceptance. These laws respect universal human rights and they are grounded in evidence. These laws ensure that people living with HIV and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment. Unfortunately  these good laws are counter balanced by a mass of really bad law    law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation  laws which specifically punish people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. These laws fly in the face of science  and they are grounded in prejudice and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition and a selective reading of religion. But you know what  You don't have to take my word for it. We're going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law. The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American. And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law on HIV transmission and exposure    neither of which offense he actually committed. then that is telling society that is unacceptable  that's bad behavior. And I think the severity of that punishment tells you how bad you are as a person. You're a class B felon  lifetime sex offender. You are a very  very  very bad person. And you did a very  very  very bad thing. And so that's just programmed into you. And you go through the correctional system and everyone's telling you the same thing. And you're just like  I'm a very bad person. Shereen El Feki  It's not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws. Some countries have good laws  laws which could stem the tide of HIV. The problem is that these laws are flouted. Because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens. And this is exactly what happened to Helma and Dongo from Namibia. when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check up. The nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for HIV that day. I took the test and the result showed I was positive. That's the day I found out. The nurse said to me   Why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are HIV positive  Why are you pregnant when you are living positive   I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me. Because I am HIV positive. They didn't give the forms to me or explain what was in the form. The nurse just came with it already marked where I had to sign. And with the labor pain  I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me. I just signed. SE  Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom are among the    million people living with HIV according to recent estimates. They're the lucky ones because they're still alive. According to those same estimates  in       .  million people died of AIDS related causes. These are terrible and tragic figures. But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics  we actually see some reason for hope. Looking globally  the number of new infections of HIV is declining. And looking globally as well  deaths are also starting to fall. There are many reasons for these positive developments  but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world on anti retroviral therapy  the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check. Now there are still many problems. Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it. In some parts of the world    like here in the Middle East and North Africa    new infections are rising and so are deaths. And the money  the money we need for the global response to HIV  that is shrinking. But for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV. But in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law. It's for this reason that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law  of which I'm a member  was established by the agencies of the United Nations    to look at the ways that legal environments are affecting people living with HIV and those at greatest risk  and to recommend what should be done to make the law an ally  not an enemy  of the global response to HIV. Let me give you just one example of the way a legal environment can make a positive difference. People who inject drugs are one of those groups I mentioned. They're at high risk of HIV through contaminated injection equipment and other risk related behaviors. In fact  one in every    new infections of HIV is among people who inject drugs. Now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country. But some countries take a harder line on this than others. In Thailand people who use drugs  or are merely suspected of using drugs  are placed in detention centers  like the one you see here  where they are supposed to clean up. There is absolutely no evidence to show that throwing people into detention cures their drug dependence. There is  however  ample evidence to show that incarcerating people increases their risk of HIV and other infections. We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks in people who inject drugs. It's called harm reduction  and it involves  among other things  providing clean needles and syringes  offering opioid substitution therapy and other evidence based treatments to reduce drug dependence. It involves providing information and education and condoms to reduce HIV transmission  and also providing HIV testing and counseling and treatment should people become infected. Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction the results are striking. Australia and Switzerland were two countries which introduced harm reduction very early on in their HIV epidemics  and they have a very low rate of HIV among injecting drug users. The U.S. and Malaysia came to harm reduction a little later  and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations. Thailand and Russia  however  have resisted harm reduction and have stringent laws which punish drug use. And hey  surprise  very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs. At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence  and we've heard the experiences of over     people from     countries. And the trend  Well the trend is clear. Where you criminalize people living with HIV or those at greatest risk  you fuel the epidemic. Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV or a cure for AIDS    now that's rocket science. But changing the law isn't. And in fact  a number of countries are starting to make progress on a number of points. To begin  countries need to review their legislation as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups. On the back of those reviews  governments should repeal laws that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV or those at greatest risk. Repealing a law isn't easy  and it's particularly difficult when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex. But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway. One of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground. So for example  outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest. We can also train judges so that they find flexibilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of tolerance rather than prejudice. We can retool prisons so that HIV prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners. The key to all this is reinforcing civil society. Because civil society is key to raising awareness among vulnerable groups of their legal rights. But awareness needs action. And so we need to ensure that these people who are living with HIV or at greatest risk of HIV have access to legal services and they have equal access to the courts. And also important is talking to communities so that we change interpretations of religious or customary law  which is too often used to justify punishment and fuel stigma. For many of us here HIV is not an abstract threat. It hits very close to home. The law  on the other hand  can seem remote  arcane  the stuff of specialists  but it isn't. Because for those of us who live in democracies  or in aspiring democracies  the law begins with us. Laws that treat people living with HIV or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves  as equals. If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime  then that is the change we need to spread. Thank you. ici faire Des choses on peut manger. c'est pas pass  the first time. about this convention. It's not so much  as so little has to do with what everything is. But it is within our self interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves. The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living. Common knowledge  but important nonetheless. As we face fear in these times  and fear is all around us  we also have anti fear. It's hard to imagine or measure. The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis. when a lot of us    you know what I'm saying  But    you know what I'm saying  Because  as a hip hop thing  you know what I'm saying  TED be rocking    you know what I'm saying. Like so I wrote a song  and I hope you guys dig it. It's a song about people and sasquatches    And other French science stuff. That's French science. Okay  here we go. I know that I'm in trouble that I'm in trouble by myself But every time it gets me And you're the one that I want to be so saucy And you're the one I want to  unclear   baby And you can do anything as long as you don't get hurt along the way back If I survive  I'm going to tell you what is wrong Because if you were  unclear  And I think that you're looking like a  unclear  I give you what I want to be you could use as many of those things that you want. And the computer models  no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use  are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions. Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute  and I arrived at a conclusion. Tomorrow is another day. Not just any day  but it is a day. It will get here  there's no question. And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one. It's believable  it's tactile. You can reach out    things are solid. You can move objects from one area to another. You can feel your body. You can say   I'd like to go over to this location   and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location  at will. That's something you live inside of every day. Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding  we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves  comporary or non comporary  will figuratively figure into the folding of our non understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from. So  as I say before the last piece  feel not as though it is a sphere we live on  rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin. Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes  it will be plain to see. This is my final piece. And just remember  everything you are    it's more important to realize the negative space  as music is only the division of space  it is the space we are listening to divided as such  which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be. So please  without further ado. Thank you. This is a fun one. It goes like this. Okay  for the last piece I'd like to do  this one goes very similar to this. I hope you guys recognize it. Here we go. Okay  that still works. Okay  good. All right  here we go. Here we go. Yeah  yo  yo  yo Thank you. Enjoy the rest. When the Industrial Revolution started  the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil  and this carbon powered the Industrial Revolution  it put the  Great  in Great Britain  and led to Britain's temporary world domination. And then  in       coal production in Britain peaked  and has declined ever since. In due course  Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea  and in the year       oil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked  and they're now on the decline. These observations about the finiteness of easily accessible  local  secure fossil fuels  this is a motivation for saying   Well  what's next  What is life after fossil fuels going to be like  Shouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels   Another motivation  of course  is climate change. And when people talk about life after fossil fuels and climate change action  I think there's a lot of fluff  a lot of greenwash  a lot of misleading advertising  and I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap and help people understand the actions that really make a difference and to focus on ideas that do add up. Let me illustrate this with what physicists call a back of envelope calculation. We love back of envelope calculations. You ask a question  you write down some numbers  and you get yourself an answer. It may not be very accurate  but it may make you say   Hmm.  So here's a question  Imagine if we said   Oh yes  we can get off fossil fuels. We'll use biofuels. Problem solved. Transport  we don't need oil anymore.  Well  what if we grew the biofuels for a road on the grass verge at the edge of the road  How wide would the verge have to be for that to work out  Okay  so let's put in some numbers. Let's have our cars go at    miles per hour. Let's say they do    miles per gallon. That's the European average for new cars. Let's say the productivity of biofuel plantations is       litres of biofuel per hectare per year. That's true of European biofuels. And let's imagine the cars are spaced    meters apart from each other  and they're just perpetually going along this road. The length of the road doesn't matter  because the longer the road  the more biofuel plantation we've got. What do we do with these numbers  Well  you take the first number  and you divide by the other three  and you get eight kilometers. And that's the answer. That's how wide the plantation would have to be  given these assumptions. And maybe that makes you say   Hmm. Maybe this isn't going to be quite so easy.  And it might make you think  perhaps there's an issue to do with areas  and in this talk  I'd like to talk about land areas  and ask  is there an issue about areas  The answer is going to be yes but it depends which country you are in. So let's start in the United Kingdom  since that's where we are today. The energy consumption of the United Kingdom  the total energy consumption  not just transport  but everything  I like to quantify it in light bulbs. It's as if we've all got     light bulbs on all the time      kilowatt hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the U.K. So there's    light bulbs' worth for transport     light bulbs' worth for heating  and    light bulbs' worth for making electricity  and other things are relatively small compared to those three big fish. It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well  and    percent of this energy today still comes from fossil fuels  and    percent only from other  greener    possibly greener    sources like nuclear power and renewables. So  that's the U.K.  and the population density of the U.K. is     people per square kilometer  and I'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures. On the vertical axis  I'm going to show you how much light bulbs    what our energy consumption per person is  and we're at     light bulbs per person  and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area of the United Kingdom  and the population density is on the horizontal axis  and we're     people per square kilometer. Let's add European countries in blue  and you can see there's quite a variety. I should emphasize  both of these axes are logarithmic. As you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you're going up a factor of   . Next  let's add Asia in red  the Middle East and North Africa in green  sub Saharan Africa in blue  black is South America  purple is Central America  and then in pukey yellow  we have North America  Australia and New Zealand. And you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions. Countries are different from each other. Top left  we have Canada and Australia  with enormous land areas  very high per capita consumption      or     light bulbs per person  and very low population densities. Top right  Bahrain has the same energy consumption per person  roughly  as Canada  over     light bulbs per person  but their population density is a factor of     times greater        people per square kilometer. Bottom right  Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain but consumes     times less per person. Bottom left  well  there's no one. But there used to be a whole load of people. Here's another message from this diagram. I've added on little blue tails behind Sudan  Libya  China  India  Bangladesh. That's    years of progress. Where were they    years ago  and where are they now  And the message is  most countries are going to the right  and they're going up  up and to the right    bigger population density and higher per capita consumption. So  we may be off in the top right hand corner  slightly unusual  the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany  Japan  South Korea  the Netherlands  and a bunch of other slightly odd countries  but many other countries are coming up and to the right to come and join us  so we're a picture  if you like  of what the future energy consumption might be looking like in other countries too. And I've also added in this diagram now some pink lines that go down and to the right. Those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area  which I measure in watts per square meter. So  for example  the middle line there   .  watts per square meter  is the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia  Norway  Mexico in purple  and Bangladesh    years ago  and half of the world's population lives in countries that are already above that line. The United Kingdom is consuming  .   watts per square meter. So's Germany  and Japan is consuming a bit more. So  let's now say why this is relevant. Why is it relevant  Well  we can measure renewables in the same units and other forms of power production in the same units  and renewables is one of the leading ideas for how we could get off our    percent fossil fuel habit. So here come some renewables. Energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter in European climates. What does that mean  And you might have anticipated that result  given what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago. Well  we consume  .   watts per square meter. What this means is  even if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops  you couldn't match today's energy consumption. Wind power produces a bit more   .  watts per square meter  but that's only twice as big as  .   watts per square meter  so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms  you need wind farms half the area of the U.K. I've got data to back up all these assertions  by the way. Next  let's look at solar power. Solar panels  when you put them on a roof  deliver about    watts per square meter in England. If you really want to get a lot from solar panels  you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method where you leap off the roof and coat the countryside with solar panels too. Solar parks  because of the gaps between the panels  deliver less. They deliver about   watts per square meter of land area. And here's a solar park in Vermont with real data delivering  .  watts per square meter. Remember where we are   .   watts per square meter  wind farms  .   solar parks about five. So  whatever  whichever of those renewables you pick  the message is  whatever mix of those renewables you're using  if you want to power the U.K. on them  you're going to need to cover something like    percent or    percent of the country with those renewables. And I'm not saying that's a bad idea. We just need to understand the numbers. I'm absolutely not anti renewables. I love renewables. But I'm also pro arithmetic.  Laughter  Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area  because you don't have the problem of clouds  and so this facility delivers    watts per square meter  this one    watts per square meter  and this one in Spain   watts per square meter. Being generous to concentrating solar power  I think it's perfect credible it could deliver    watts per square meter. So that's nice. Of course  Britain doesn't have any deserts. Yet.  Laughter  So here's a summary so far. All renewables  much as I love them  are diffuse. They all have a small power per unit area  and we have to live with that fact. And that means  if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the United Kingdom on the scale of today's consumption  you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country sized  not the entire country but a fraction of the country  a substantial fraction. There are other options for generating power as well which don't involve fossil fuels. So there's nuclear power  and on this Ordnance Survey map  you can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer. That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer  which works out to       watts per square meter. So by this particular metric  nuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables. Of course  other metrics matter too  and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems. But the same goes for renewables as well. Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh  and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating the burning of the effigy of the windmill. So people are anti everything  and we've got to keep all the options on the table. What can a country like the U.K. do on the supply side  Well  the options are  I'd say  these three  power renewables  and recognizing that they need to be close to country sized  other people's renewables  so we could go back and talk very politely to the people in the top left hand side of the diagram and say   Uh  we don't want renewables in our backyard  but  um  please could we put them in yours instead   And that's a serious option. It's a way for the world to handle this issue. So countries like Australia  Russia  Libya  Kazakhstan  could be our best friends for renewable production. And a third option is nuclear power. So that's some supply side options. In addition to the supply levers that we can push  and remember  we need large amounts  because at the moment  we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels. In addition to those levers  we could talk about other ways of solving this issue  namely  we could reduce demand  and that means reducing population   I'm not sure how to do that   or reducing per capita consumption. So let's talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side. First  transport. Here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport  and people often say   Oh  yes  technology can answer everything. We can make vehicles that are a hundred times more efficient.  And that's almost true. Let me show you. The energy consumption of this typical tank here is    kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers. That's the average European car. Eighty kilowatt hours. Can we make something a hundred times better by applying those physics principles I just listed  Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's    times better in energy consumption  and it's powered by biofuel  by Weetabix. And there are other options in between  because maybe the lady in the tank would say   No  no  no  that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle  please.  So  well  we could persuade her to get into a train  and that's still a lot more efficient than a car  but that might be a lifestyle change  or there's the eco car  top left. It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone  and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at    miles per hour. In between  perhaps some more realistic options on this lever  transport lever  are electric vehicles  so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle  perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol powered tank. Next  there's the heating lever. Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain  and quite a lot of that is going into homes and other buildings doing space heating and water heating. So here's a typical crappy British house. It's my house  with the Ferrari out front. What can we do to it  Well  the laws of physics are written up there  which describe what    how the power consumption for heating is driven by the things you can control. The things you can control are the temperature difference between the inside and the outside  and there's this remarkable technology called a thermostat. You grasp it  you rotate it to the left  and your energy consumption in the home will decrease. I've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change. You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness of your building    put fluff in the walls  fluff in the roof  and a new front door and so forth  and the sad truth is  this will save you money. That's not sad  that's good  but the sad truth is  it'll only get about    percent of the leakiness of your building  if you do these things  which are good ideas. If you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards with a crappy house like this  you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in London. You can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps which use a smaller bit of high grade energy like electricity to move heat from your garden into your house. The third demand side option I want to talk about  the third way to reduce energy consumption is  read your meters. And people talk a lot about smart meters  but you can do it yourself. Use your own eyes and be smart  read your meter  and if you're anything like me  it'll change your life. Here's a graph I made. I was writing a book about sustainable energy  and a friend asked me   Well how much energy do you use at home   And I was embarrassed. I didn't actually know. And so I started reading the meter every week  and the old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph  and then      is shown in green at the bottom  and that was when I was reading the meter every week  and my life changed  because I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference  and my gas consumption plummeted because I started tinkering with the thermostat and the timing on the heating system  and I knocked more than a half off my gas bills. There's a similar story for my electricity consumption  where switching off the DVD players  the stereos  the computer peripherals that were on all the time  and just switching them on when I needed them  knocked another third off my electricity bills too. So we need a plan that adds up  and I've described for you six big levers  and we need big action because we get    percent of our energy from fossil fuels  and so you need to push hard on most if not all of these levers. And most of these levers have popularity problems  and if there is a lever you don't like the use of  well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers. So I'm a strong advocate of having grown up conversations that are based on numbers and facts  and I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just    light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources. So  if you wanted to get    light bulbs  remember  today our total energy consumption is     light bulbs' worth. If you wanted    from wind  this map visualizes a solution for the U.K. It's got     wind farms  each     square kilometers in size  and that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind. Nuclear power  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map. That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power. Biomass  to get    light bulbs per person  you'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth  either in our country  or in someone else's country  possibly Ireland  possibly somewhere else.  Laughter  And a fourth supply side option  concentrating solar power in other people's deserts  if you wanted to get    light bulbs' worth  then we're talking about these eight hexagons down at the bottom right. The total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth of someone else's Sahara  and you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France to bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey. We need a plan that adds up. We need to stop shouting and start talking  and if we can have a grown up conversation  make a plan that adds up and get building  maybe this low carbon revolution will actually be fun. Thank you very much for listening. I know this is going to sound strange  but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. See  I grew up in Bethlehem  Pennsylvania  the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer  and when I was growing up  he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together  like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel  with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day  he came home  when I was about    years old  and at the dinner table  he announced that for our next project   we were going to build ... a robot. A robot. Now  I was thrilled about this  because at school  there was a bully named Kevin  and he was picking on me  because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this  so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. See  he owned a chromium plating company  and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this  that could basically do the heavy lifting. But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted  either. He and I worked on it for several years  but it was the     s  and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later  he was diagnosed with cancer. You see  what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time  and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of   . I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college  I decided to study engineering  like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon  and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects  and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By       I was a young professor at USC  and I was just building up my own robotics lab  and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it  and we would    we were just amazed. We started playing with this  and that afternoon  we realized that we could use this new  universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab. So  rather than have it fight or do industrial work  we decided to build a planter  put the robot into the center of it  and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot  and we wrote some special scripts and software  so that anyone in the world could come in  and by clicking on the screen  they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden  remotely. And if you watered it a few times  we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now  this was an engineering project  and we published some papers on the system design of it  but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited  after the first year  by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria  to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say  it remained online there     hours a day  for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. Now  one day  I got a call out of the blue from a student  who asked a very simple but profound question. He said   Is the robot real   Now  everyone else had assumed it was  and we knew it was  because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant  because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then  basically  index them in a computer system  such that it would appear that there was a real robot  when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it  I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference. This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here  I looked up Hubert Dreyfus  who's a world renowned professor of philosophy  And I talked with him about this and he said   This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology  the study of how do we know that something is true.  So he and I started working together  and we coined a new term   telepistemology   the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists  engineers and philosophers to write essays about this  and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student  who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true  this project taught me an important lesson about life  which is to always question assumptions. Now  the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating  my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other  and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking  what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment  Like  for example  what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House  So  because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware  we decided that  rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party  we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele Actor. We got a human  someone who's very outgoing and gregarious  and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment  cameras and microphones  and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment  and then over the Internet  people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing  but then  more importantly  they could participate  by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go  and then conveying those to the Tele Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year  Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up  I had about    seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said   The Tele Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project  and people are watching her on their screens  there's cameras involved and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear  and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next.  And he said   Wait a second. That's what I do.  So he loved the concept  and when the Tele Actor walked onstage  she walked right up to him  and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips. We were totally surprised    we had no idea that would happen. And he was great  he just gave her a big hug in return  and it worked out great. But that night  as we were packing up  I asked the Tele Actor  how did the Tele Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson  And she said they hadn't. She said  when she was just about to walk onstage  the Tele Directors still were trying to agree on what to do  and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. So  the success of the Tele Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life  which is that  when in doubt  improvise. Now  the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment    chemotherapy treatments    and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy  where tiny  radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done  as you can see here  is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result  the needles damage these organs  cause damage  which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered  what if we could modify the system  so that the needles could come in at different angles  So we simulated this  we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs  and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. So now  we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins  and we're building a robot that has a number of    it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here  they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So  by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel  this project also taught me an important lesson  When in doubt  when your path is blocked  pivot. And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over       hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious  like suturing  and currently  all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering  what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks  and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery  and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster  Now  it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel  who's here at Berkeley  has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters  do incredibly interesting  beautiful acrobatics  by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task    with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task  and we record the motions of the robot. So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot    this is what the robot's path looks like  those three examples. Now  those are much better than what a novice like me could do  but they're still jerky and imprecise. So we record all these examples  the data  and then go through a sequence of steps. First  we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering  a technique from control theory  that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations    they're all noisy and imperfect    and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot  we observe what happens  then we adjust the controls  using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results  adjust the controls again  and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory  and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at    times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask  at    times the speed of a human. So this project also  because of its involved practicing and learning  doing something over and over again  this project also has a lesson  which is  if you want to do something well  there's no substitute for practice  practice  practice. So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays  high school students can build robots  like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. But  it's very    now ... And now  I have a daughter  named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots  too. Maybe it runs in the family. I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work  and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems  but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in  the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations  the devices we dream about  can inspire us to be better humans. Thank you. The great texts of the ancient world don't survive to us in their original form. They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them. And so it is with Archimedes  the great Greek mathematician. Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books  and they're called A  B and C. And A was lost by an Italian humanist in     . And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in     . Now Codex C was only discovered in       and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the   th of January      . And this is Codex C here. Now Codex C is actually buried in this book. It's buried treasure. Because this book is actually a prayer book. It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the   th of April      . And to make his prayer book he used parchment. But he didn't use new parchment  he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts  and there were seven of them. And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven. He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts. He erased all of their texts  and then he cut the sheets down in the middle  he shuffled them up  and he rotated them    degrees  and he wrote prayers on top of these books. And essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for     years  and we have a prayer book. The prayer book was discovered by this guy  Johan Ludvig Heiberg  in     . And with just a magnifying glass  he transcribed as much of the text as he could. And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts. They weren't in A and B at all  they were completely new texts by Archimedes  and they were called  The Method  and  The Stomachion.  And it became a world famous manuscript. Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition. It got in worse condition in the   th century after Heiberg saw it. Forgeries were painted over it  and it suffered very badly from mold. This book is the definition of a write off. It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution. But it's not in an institution  it was bought by a private owner in     . Why did he buy this book  Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe. He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous. He wanted to make that which was expensive free. And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle. Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek  but they should have the chance to do it. So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes  and he promised to pay for all the work. And it was an expensive job  but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think because these people  they didn't come from money  they came from Archimedes. And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds. They came from particle physics  they came from classical philology  they came from book conservation  they came from ancient mathematics  they came from data management  they came from scientific imaging and program management. And they got together to work on this manuscript. The first problem was a conservation problem. And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with  There was glue on the spine of the book. And if you look at this photograph carefully  the bottom half of this is rather brown. And that glue is hide glue. Now if you're a conservator  you can take off this glue reasonably easily. The top half is Elmer's wood glue. It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry. And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on. And so before we could start imaging Archimedes  we had to take this book apart. So it took four years to take apart. And this is a rare action shot  ladies and gentlemen. Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax  because this was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church and they'd used candle wax. And the candle wax was dirty  and we couldn't image through the wax. So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax. It's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is  but it came out in little bits very often. And normally in a book  you wouldn't worry about the little bits  but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text. So  tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place. Then  having done that  we started to image the manuscript. And we imaged the manuscript in    different wavebands of light. Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light  you see different things. And here is an image of a page imaged in    different wavebands of light. But none of them worked. So what we did was we processed the images together  and we put two images into one blank screen. And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript. And the image on the left is the normal red image. And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image. And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing. If you merge them together into one digital canvas  the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright. The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark. The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another. And it'll come out dark but red  and then you can start to read it rather clearly. And that's what it looks like. Now that's a before and after image  but you don't read the image on the screen like that. You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in  and you can just read it now. If you process the same two images in a different way  you can actually get rid of the prayer book text. And this is terribly important  because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C. And there we are  I can give them to you. With this kind of imaging    this kind of infrared  ultraviolet  invisible light imaging    we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries. How were we going to do that  Well we took the manuscript  and we decided to image it in X ray fluorescence imaging. So an X ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom. And that electron disappears. And as it disappears  an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place. And when it takes its place  it sheds electromagnetic radiation. It sheds an X ray. And this X ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits. And what we wanted to get was the iron. Because the ink was written in iron. And if we can map where this X ray that comes out  where it comes from  we can map all the iron on the page  then theoretically we can read the image. The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this. So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California  which is a particle accelerator. Electrons go around one way  positrons go around the other. They meet in the middle  and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton. Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam. But as the electrons go round at the speed of light  they shed X rays. And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system. This is called synchrotron radiation  and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing. But we wanted it to look at atoms  at iron atoms  so that we could read the page from before and after. And lo and behold  we found that we could do it. It took about    minutes to do a single page. So what did we discover  Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called  The Stomachion.  And this didn't exist in Codices A and B. And we knew that it involved this square. And this is a perfect square  and it's divided into    bits. But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these    bits. And now we think we know. He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those    bits and still make a perfect square. Anyone want to guess the answer  It's        divided into     families. And the important point about this is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics. And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics. The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made  the scribe had made his book out of  and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides. Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C. He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes. And in     B.C. he and Demosthenes together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of Philip of Macedon. So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon. This was a bad idea  because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great  and they lost the battle of Chaeronea. Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world  Hyperides found himself on trial for treason. And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial    and it's a great speech   Best of all   he says   is to win. But if you can't win  then you should fight for a noble cause  because then you'll be remembered. Consider the Spartans. They won enumerable victories  but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends. The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of Thermopylae where they were butchered to a man  but fought for the freedom of Greece.  It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off. He lived for another    years  then the Macedonian faction caught up with him. They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory  and no one knows what they did with his body. So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity  speaking to us  not from the grave  because his grave doesn't exist  but from the Athenian law courts. Now I should say at this point that normally when you're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off  you don't find unique texts. And to find two in one manuscript is really something. To find three is completely weird. And we found three. Aristotle's  Categories  is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it  possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry. Now all this data that we collected  all the images  all the raw images  all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a Creative Commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose. Why did the owner of the manuscript do this  He did this because he understands data as well as books. Now the thing to do with books  if you want to ensure their long term utility  is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them. The thing to do with data  if you want it to survive  is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible. And that's what he did. And institutions can learn from this. Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing. And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web  at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site or the University Library of X's site  which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data. What you want to do is to aggregate it all together. Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions. It's going to be built by users  by people who get this data together  by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from  all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from  people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things. And that is the future of the Web. And it's an attractive and beautiful future  if only we can make it happen. Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example  and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy    all the raw data  all the descriptions  all the metadata. under a Creative Commons license. Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts  but the data is fantastic. And the result of this is that if you do a Google search on images right now and you type in  Illuminated manuscript Koran  for example     of the    images you'll find come from my institution. Now  let's think about this for a minute. What's in it for the institution  There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution. You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing  but let's talk about selfish things. Because what's really in it for the institution is this  Now why do people go to the Louvre  They go to see the Mona Lisa. Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa  Because they already know what she looks like. And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. Now  there is no need for these restrictions at all. And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses  and it would be a great benefit to everybody. Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet. Thank you very much indeed. My talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about. It's called the Arab Spring. Anyone heard of it  So in       power shifted  from the few to the many  from oval offices to central squares  from carefully guarded airwaves to open source networks. But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation  there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways. I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup. Since       we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people    young and old  men and women  educated and illiterate. My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now. Now this region's very diverse  and every country is unique. But those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today. I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt. It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there  of course. But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence. But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women  revealing some surprises along the way. So after analyzing mounds of data  what we discovered was this  Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of     . If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions  it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel. To tell you what I mean  consider this trend in Egypt. On paper the country was doing great. In fact  it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth. But under the surface was a very different reality. In       right before the revolution  even though GDP per capita had been growing at five percent for several years  Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives. Now this is very unusual  because globally we find that  not surprisingly  people feel better as their country gets richer. And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services. But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt. As the country got more well off  unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted. But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice. It was also people's deep longing for freedom. Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory  Arabs didn't despise Western liberty  they desired it. As early as       we asked Arabs  and Muslims in general around the world  what they admired most about the West. Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice. In their own words to an open ended question we heard   Their political system is transparent and it's following democracy in its true sense.  Another said it was  liberty and freedom and being open minded with each other.  Majorities as high as    percent and greater in Egypt  Indonesia and Iran told us in      that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right  especially in Egypt. Eighty eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress    the highest percentage of any country we surveyed. But pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day to day experience  especially in Egypt. While aspiring to democracy the most  they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month    at only four percent. So while economic development made a few people rich  it left many more worse off. As people felt less and less free  they also felt less and less provided for. So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers  they viewed them as essentially prison wardens. So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's    year rule  they potentially could be an example for the region. If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law  it could be a model. If  however  the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed  the consequences could be catastrophic    not just for Egypt  but for the entire region. The signs don't look good  some have said. Islamists  not the young liberals that sparked the revolution  won the majority in Parliament. The military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country's economy continues to suffer. Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone  however  ignores the real revolution. Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years  far less divided on religious secular lines than we would think and poised for the demands of democracy. Whether they support Islamists or liberals  Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical  and they are jobs  stability and education  not moral policing. But most of all  for the first time in decades  they expect to be active participants  not spectators  in the affairs of their country. I was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from Egypt and Tunisia a couple of weeks ago. And what really struck me about them was that they weren't only optimistic  but they kind of struck me as nervous  for lack of a better word. One said to me   Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football     or soccer  as we say in America     and now they gather to watch Parliament.   They're really watching us  and we can't help but worry that we're not going to live up to their expectations.  And what really struck me is that less than    months ago  it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government. And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new found hope for the future. So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives  but not only that  they thought their future would be no better. What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier. It actually got harder. But people's expectations for their future went up significantly. And this hope  this optimism  endured a year of turbulent transition. One reason that there's this optimism is because  contrary to what many people have said  most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways. So while Egyptians were known for their single digit turnout in elections before the revolution  the last election had around    percent voter turnout    men and women. Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in         I'm surprised it was a quarter       percent thought that this last election was honest. Now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people's faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone. Now I know what some of you are thinking. The Egyptian people  and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition  have very high expectations of the government. They're just victims of a long time autocracy  expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems. But this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt far from the cameras in Tahrir Square. And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves. In the country once known for its passive resignation  where  as bad as things got  only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official  today    percent tell us that if there's a problem in their community  it's up to them to fix it. And three fourths believe they not only have the responsibility  but the power to make change. And this empowerment also applies to women  whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated. They were doctors and dissidents  artists and organizers. A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt were women. Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women. What we've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus. We found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border. Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women. Where women agree  however  is on their own role  and that it must be central and active. And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country    on the issue of women's rights. Now how men feel about women's rights matters to the future of this region. Because we discovered a link between men's support for women's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country. So the question becomes  What drives men's support for women's rights  What about men's views of religion and law   Does  a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights  The answer is no. We found absolutely no correlation  no impact whatsoever  between these two variables. What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment  their level of education as well as a high score on their country's U.N. Human Development Index. What this means is that human development  not secularization  is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East. And the transformation continues. From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street  it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people. Thank you. We are today talking about moral persuasion. What is moral and immoral in trying to change people's behaviors by using technology and using design  And I don't know what you expect  but when I was thinking about that issue  I early on realized what I'm not able to give you are answers. I'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we're living in a pluralist society. My values can be radically different from your values. Which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral. But I also realized that there is one thing that I could give you. And that is what this guy behind me gave the world    Socrates. It is questions. What I can do and what I would like to do with you is give you  like that initial question  a set of questions to figure out for yourself  layer by layer  like peeling an onion  getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion. And I'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things. So it's a first very simple  a very obvious question I would like to give you  What are your intentions if you are designing something  And obviously intentions are not the only thing  so here is another example for one of these applications. There are a couple of these kinds of eco dashboards right now    so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently. This here is Nissan's MyLeaf  where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people  so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently. And these things are very effective  it turns out  so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors    like not stopping on a red headlight. Because that way you have to stop and restart the engine  and that would use quite some fuel  wouldn't it  So despite this being a very well intended application  obviously there was a side effect of that. And here's another example for one of these side effects. Commendable  a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do    like tying their shoes. And at first that sounds very nice  very benign  well intended. But it turns out  if you look into research on people's mindset  that caring about outcomes  caring about public recognition  caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long term psychological well being. It's better if you care about learning something. It's better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people. So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually in and of itself has a long term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status  we're actually positively endorsing this as a good and a normal thing to care about    that way  possibly having a detrimental effect on the long term psychological well being of ourselves as a culture. So that's a second  very obvious question  What are the effects of what you're doing  The effects that you're having with the device  like less fuel  as well as the effects of the actual tools you're using to get people to do things    public recognition. Now is that all    intention  effect  Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both. Both good long term and short term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman's Freedom  where the whole point of that application is  well  we're usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people  with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done. And I think most of us will agree  well that's something well intended and also has good consequences. In the words of Michel Foucault   It is a technology of the self.  It is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course  to shape itself. But the problem is  as Foucault points out  that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side. As you see in today's modern liberal democracies  the society  the state  not only allows us to determine our self  to shape our self  it also demands it of us. It demands that we optimize ourselves  that we control ourselves  that we self manage continuously because that's the only way in which such a liberal society works. These technologies want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us. They want us to fit in even better. They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in. Now I don't say that is necessarily a bad thing. I just think that this example points us to a general realization  and that is no matter what technology or design you look at  even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects    like Stutzman's Freedom    comes with certain values embedded in it. And we can question these values. We can question  Is it a good thing that all of us continuously self optimize ourselves to fit better into that society  Or to give you another example  what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves  Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects  Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments. So that's a third question  What values do you use to judge  And speaking of values  I've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online  and when I'm talking with people  more often than not there is a weird bias. And that bias is that we're asking  is this or that  still  ethical  Is it  still  permissible  We're asking things like  Is this Oxfam donation form    where the regular monthly donation is the preset default and people  maybe without intending it  are that way encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one time donation    is that still permissible  Is it still ethical  We're fishing at the low end. But in fact  that question  Is it still ethical   is just one way of looking at ethics. Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture  you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be. For Aristotle  ethics was not about the question  is that still good  or is it bad  Ethics was about the question of how to live life well. And he put that in the word  arete   which we  from the  Ancient Greek   translate as  virtue.  But really it means excellence. It means living up to your own full potential as a human being. And that is an idea that  I think  that Paul Richard Buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said   Products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives.  Our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us. They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us. And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens  asking   What is the vision of the good life that our products  our design  present to us    then you often get the shivers  because of how little we expect of each other  of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like. So that's the fourth question I'd like to leave you with  What vision of the good life do your designs convey  And speaking of design  you notice that I already broadened the discussion. Because it's not just persuasive technology that we're talking about here  it's any piece of design that we put out here in the world. I don't know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who  back in the '  s  made the argument we cannot not communicate. Even if we choose to be silent  we chose to be silent. We're communicating something by choosing to be silent. And in the same way that we cannot not communicate  we cannot not persuade. Whatever we do or refrain from doing  whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world has a persuasive component. It tries to affect people. It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us. Which is what Peter Paul Verbeek  the Dutch philosopher of technology  says. No matter whether we as designers intend it or not  we materialize morality. We make certain things harder and easier to do. We organize the existence of people. We put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by everything we put out there in the world. Even something as innocuous as a set of school chairs is a persuasive technology. Because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life    the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching  the others listening  in which it is about  learning is done while sitting  in which you learn for yourself  in which you're not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground. And even something as innocuous as a single design chair    like this one by Arne Jacobsen    is a persuasive technology. Because  again  it communicates an idea of the good life. A good life    a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying   In the good life  goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair. Workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair.  The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well designed chair  where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this  and where there is something as conspicuous consumption  where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is. So these are the kinds of layers  the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today    the question of  What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you're designing something  What are the effects  intended and unintended  that you're having  What are the values you're using to judge those  What are the virtues  the aspirations that you're actually expressing in that  And how does that apply  not just to persuasive technology  but to everything you design  Do we stop there  I don't think so. I think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this    and this is nothing but life itself. Why  when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design  should we stop at design and not ask ourselves  how does it apply to our own life   Why should the lamp or the house be an art object  but not our life   as Michel Foucault puts it. Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson. This is Buster setting up a pull up machine at the office of his new startup Habit Labs  where they're trying to build up other applications like Health Month for people. And why is he building a thing like this  Well here is the set of axioms that Habit Labs  Buster's startup  put up for themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they're building these applications    a set of moral principles they set themselves for working together    and one of them being   We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout.  Because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question  what vision of the good life do you yourself want to live  And with that  I thank you. Is E.T. out there  Well  I work at the SETI Institute. That's almost my name. SETI  Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In other words  I look for aliens  and when I tell people that at a cocktail party  they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate. Now  a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic  ridiculous  maybe even hopeless  but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege  okay  and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work  if that's what you call it. This thing   whoops  can we go back  Hello  come in  Earth. There we go. All right. This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory behind the Sierra Nevadas  and in       I was working there collecting data for my thesis. Now  it's kinda lonely  it's kinda tedious  just collecting data  so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescopes or even of myself  because  you know  at night  I would be the only hominid within about    miles. So here are pictures of myself. The observatory had just acquired a new book  written by a Russian cosmologist by the name of Joseph Shklovsky  and then expanded and translated and edited by a little known Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan. And I remember reading that book  and at   in the morning I was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate  to send bits of information from one star system to another. Now  at   o'clock in the morning when you're all alone  haven't had much sleep  that was a very romantic idea  but it was that idea    the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using this same technology    that appealed to me so much that    years later I took a job at the SETI Institute. Now  I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous  and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story  or I was just  you know  misremembering something  but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine  and sure enough  there you can see the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that analog calculating device. So it was true. All right. Now  the idea for doing this  it wasn't very old at the time that I made that photo. The idea dates from       when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia  pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T. Now  Frank didn't hear anything. Actually he did  but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force  which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence. But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing   and I'll get back to that   and on the basis of this experiment  which didn't succeed  we have been doing SETI ever since  not continuously  but ever since. We still haven't heard anything. We still haven't heard anything. In fact  we don't know about any life beyond Earth  but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change rather soon  and part of the reason  in fact  the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change is that the equipment's getting better. This is the Allen Telescope Array  about     miles from whatever seat you're in right now. This is something that we're using today to search for E.T.  and the electronics have gotten very much better too. This is Frank Drake's electronics in     . This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today. Some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately     trillion times better than they were in           trillion times better. That's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card  okay  But something that's not appreciated by the public is  in fact  that the experiment continues to get better  and  consequently  tends to get faster. This is a little plot  and every time you show a plot  you lose    percent of the audience. I have    of these.  Laughter  But what I plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we're searching. In other words  we're looking for a needle in a haystack. We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy. But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader  because of this increase in speed. In fact  those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent  will note that this is a semi log plot. In other words  the rate of increase is exponential. It's exponentially improving. Now  exponential is an overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time. They don't really know what exponential means  but this is exponential. In fact  it's doubling every    months  and  of course  every card carrying member of the digerati knows that that's Moore's Law. So this means that over the course of the next two dozen years  we'll be able to look at a million star systems  a million star systems  looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there. Well  a million star systems  is that interesting  I mean  how many of those star systems have planets  And the facts are  we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as    years ago  and in fact  we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago. But now we do. Recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets  and more than one. They're like  you know  kittens. You get a litter. You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch. So in fact  this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy  just in our galaxy  by the way  and I remind the non astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of     billion that we can see with our telescopes. That's a lot of real estate  but of course  most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless  like  you know  Mercury  or Neptune. Neptune's probably not very big in your life. So the question is  what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life  We don't know the answer to that either  but we will learn that answer this year  thanks to NASA's Kepler Space Telescope  and in fact  the smart money  which is to say the people who work on this project  the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand  one in a hundred  something like that. Well  even taking the pessimistic estimate  that it's one in a thousand  that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the Earth just in our own galaxy. Okay  now I've given you a lot of numbers here  but they're mostly big numbers  okay  so  you know  keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate  plenty of real estate in the universe  and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's some interesting occupants  that makes you a miracle  and I know you like to think you're a miracle  but if you do science  you learn rather quickly that every time you think you're a miracle  you're wrong  so probably not the case. All right  so the bottom line is this  Because of the increase in speed  and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos  I figure we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years. And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you  Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years  or I'll buy you a cup of coffee. So that's not so bad. I mean  even with two dozen years  you open up your browser and there's news of a signal  or you get a cup of coffee. Now  let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about  and that is  what happens  Suppose that what I say is true. I mean  who knows  but suppose it happens. Suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company. What is the effect  What's the consequence  Now  I might be at ground zero for this. I happen to know what the consequence for me would be  because we've had false alarms. This is       and this is a photo I made at about   o'clock in the morning in Mountain View here  when we were watching the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal that we thought   This is the real deal.  All right  And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right  I kept waiting for    I kept waiting for my mom to call  somebody to call  the government to call. Nobody called. Nobody called. I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around taking photos like this one  just for something to do. Well  at      in the morning  with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night  the phone rings and it's The New York Times. And I think there's a lesson in that  and that lesson is that if we pick up a signal  the media  the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast. You can be sure of that. No secrecy. That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week  because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window. But what about you  What's it going to do to you  And the answer is that we don't know the answer. We don't know what that's going to do to you  not in the long term  and not even very much in the short term. I mean  that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in        Hey Chris  you know  what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan  where you're sailing to  what will be the consequences for humanity if that turns out to be the case   And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer that you might not have understood  but it probably wouldn't have been right  and I think that to predict what finding E.T.'s going to mean  we can't predict that either. But here are a couple things I can say. To begin with  it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own. You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals. They're not building transmitters. They're going to be ahead of us  maybe by a few thousand years  maybe by a few millions years  but substantially ahead of us  and that means  if you can understand anything that they're going to say  then you might be able to short circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own. Now  you might find that a bit hyperbolic  and maybe it is  but nonetheless  it's conceivable that this will happen  and  you know  you could consider this like  I don't know  giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key to the library of Congress. It would change his day  all right  That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us. We will know that we're not that miracle  right  that we're just another duck in a row  we're not the only kids on the block  and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn. We're not a miracle  okay  The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague  but I think interesting and important  and that is  if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society  because they will be  that will tell you something about our own possibilities  that we're not inevitably doomed to self destruction. Because they survived their technology  we could do it too. Normally when you look out into the universe  you're looking back in time. All right  That's interesting to cosmologists. But in this sense  you actually can look into the future  hazily  but you can look into the future. So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection. Now  let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime  and that is  SETI  I think  is important  because it's exploration  and it's not only exploration  it's comprehensible exploration. Now  I gotta tell you  I'm always reading books about explorers. I find exploration very interesting  Arctic exploration  you know  people like Magellan  Amundsen  Shackleton  you see Franklin down there  Scott  all these guys. It's really nifty  exploration. And they're just doing it because they want to explore  and you might say   Oh  that's kind of a frivolous opportunity   but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity  because  I mean  think of ants. You know  most ants are programmed to follow one another along in a long line  but there are a couple of ants  maybe one percent of those ants  that are what they call pioneer ants  and they're the ones that wander off. They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop. You gotta get them with your thumb before they find the sugar or something. But those ants  even though most of them get wiped out  those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive. So exploration is important. I also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what I think is a critical lack in our society  and that is the lack of science literacy  the lack of the ability to even understand science. Now  look  a lot has been written about the deplorable state of science literacy in this country. You've heard about it. Well  here's one example  in fact. Polls taken  this poll was taken    years ago. It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there  we're looking for them out there  but they're here  right  Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of. Well  that would be interesting if it was true  and job security for me  but I don't think the evidence is very good. That's more  you know  sad than significant. But there are other things that people believe that are significant  like the efficacy of homeopathy  or that evolution is just  you know  sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs  or  you know  evolution  all that sort of thing  or global warming. These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity  that you can't trust the scientists. Now  we've got to solve that problem  because that's a critically important problem  and you might say   Well  okay  how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI   Well  let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem  but it can address the problem. It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science. Look  science is hard  it has a reputation of being hard  and the facts are  it is hard  and that's the result of     years of science  right  I mean  in the   th century  in the   th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library  if you could find the library  right  In the   th century  if you had a basement lab  you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home. Right  Because there was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up. Now  that's not true anymore. Today  you've got to spend years in grad school and post doc positions just to figure out what the important questions are. It's hard. There's no doubt about it. And in fact  here's an example  the Higgs boson  finding the Higgs boson. Ask the next    people you see on the streets   Hey  do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson   And I bet the answer you're going to get  is   Well  I don't know what the Higgs boson is  and I don't know if it's important.  And probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc  okay  And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem. Okay  So that doesn't get people interested in science because they can't comprehend what it's about. SETI  on the other hand  is really simple. We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that. Yes  technologically  it's very sophisticated  but everybody gets the idea. So that's one thing. The other thing is  it's exciting science. It's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings  and I think that's part of our hardwiring. I mean  we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be  if you will  competitors  or if you're the romantic sort  possibly even mates. Okay  I mean  this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth. Right  We're interested in things that have big teeth  and you can see the evolutionary value of that  and you can also see the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet. You notice they make very few programs about gerbils. It's mostly about things that have big teeth. Okay  so we're interested in these sorts of things. And not just us. It's also kids. This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science  because SETI involves all kinds of science  obviously biology  obviously astronomy  but also geology  also chemistry  various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of   We're looking for E.T.  So to me this is interesting and important  and in fact  it's my policy  even though I give a lot of talks to adults  you give talks to adults  and two days later they're back where they were. But if you give talks to kids  you know  one in    of them  some light bulb goes off  and they think   Gee  I'd never thought of that   and then they go  you know  read a book or a magazine or whatever. They get interested in something. Now it's my theory  supported only by anecdotal  personal anecdotal evidence  but nonetheless  that kids get interested in something between the ages of eight and   . You've got to get them there. So  all right  I give talks to adults  that's fine  but I try and make    percent of the talks that I give  I try and make those for kids. I remember when a guy came to our high school  actually  it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade. And he gave some talk. All I remember from it was one word  electronics. It was like Dustin Hoffman in  The Graduate   right  when he said  plastics   whatever that means  plastics. All right  so the guy said electronics. I don't remember anything else. In fact  I don't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year  but I remember electronics. And so I got interested in electronics  and you know  I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff. Here I am at about    or something  doing that sort of stuff. Okay  That had a big effect on me. So that's my point  that you can have a big effect on these kids. In fact  this reminds me  I don't know  a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto where there were about a dozen    year olds that had come to this talk. I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour. Eleven year olds  they're all sitting in a little semi circle looking up at me with big eyes  and I started  there was a white board behind me  and I started off by writing a one with    zeroes after it  and I said   All right  now look  this is the number of stars in the visible universe  and this number is so big there's not even a name for it.  And one of these kids shot up his hand  and he said   Well  actually there is a name for it. It's a sextra quadra hexa something or other.  Right  Now  that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude  but there was no doubt about it  these kids were smart. Okay  So I stopped giving the lecture. All they wanted to do was ask questions. In fact  my last comments to these kids  at the end I said   You know  you kids are smarter than the people I work with.  Now    Laughter  They didn't even care about that. What they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions.  Laughter  Let me just say  look  my job is a privilege because we're in a special time. Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all. In another generation down the line  I think we will have succeeded. So to me  it is a privilege  and when I look in the mirror  the facts are that I really don't see myself. What I see is the generation behind me. These are some kids from the Huff School  fourth graders. I talked there  what  two weeks ago  something like that. I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works  well  that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much. So I thought I'd talk about identity. That's sort of an interesting enough topic to me. And the reason was  because when I was asked to do this  I'd just read  in one of the papers  I can't remember  something from someone at Facebook saying  well   we need to make everybody use their real names.  and then that's basically all the problems solved. And that's so wrong  that's such a fundamentally  reactionary view of identity  and it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble. And so what I thought I'd do is I'll explain four sort of problems about it  and then I'll suggest a solution  which hopefully you might find interesting. So just to frame the problem  what does authenticity mean  That's me  that's a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting.  What's the Problem   That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger  and because I'm not very good at presentations  I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card. And he was incarcerated in  I think  Wakefield Prison for forging masterpieces by  I think  French Impressionists. And he's so good at it  that when he was in prison  everybody in prison  the governor and whatever  wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls  because they were so good. And so that's a masterpiece  which is a fake of a masterpiece  and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake  if you see what I mean. So when we're talking about authenticity  it's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it. I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly. So the first problem  I thought  Chip and PIN  right   Banks and legacies bringing down the system from within   Offline solutions do not work online  I'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card  right  So why is that a good example  That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well constructed system. That chip and PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop  is extremely secure  you can put scanning electron microscopes on it  you can try and grind it down  blah blah blah. Those chips have never been broken  whatever you read in the paper. And for a joke  we take that super secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe and for very lazy criminals  we still emboss the card. So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card  you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up. And even more amusingly  and on my debit card too  we print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too. Why  There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card. And if you think about it  it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first. Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals. You know what your name is  right  And when you go into a shop and buy something  it's a PIN  he doesn't care what the name is. The only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in America at the moment. And whenever I go to America  and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card  I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway  just as a security mechanism  because if a transaction ever gets disputed  and it comes back and it says Dave Birch  I know it must have been a criminal  because I would never sign it Dave Birch. So if you drop your card in the street  it means a criminal can pick it up and read it. They know the name  from the name they can find the address  and then they can go off and buy stuff online. Why do we put the name on the card  Because we think identity is something to do with names  and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card  which obsesses us. And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago  but if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever  and you think about identity  you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them. And that's very subversive in a modern world. So the second example I thought I'd use is chatrooms.  Chatrooms and Children  I'm very proud of that picture  that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first ever gig  I believe you call it  where he got paid. And I love that picture. I like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better  I like that picture for the moment. Why do I use that picture  Because that was very interesting  watching that experience as an old person. So him and his friends  they get together  they booked a room  like a church hall  and they got all their friends who had bands  and they got them together  and they do it all on Facebook  and then they sell tickets  and the first band on the   I was going to say  menu   that's probably the wrong word for it  isn't it  The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first    tickets  then the next band gets the next     and so on. They were at the bottom of the menu  they were like fifth  I thought they had no chance. He actually got    quid. Fantastic  right  But my point is  that all worked perfectly  except on the web. So they're sitting on Facebook  and they're sending these messages and arranging things and they don't know who anybody is  right  That's the big problem we're trying to solve. If only they were using the real names  Then you wouldn't be worried about them on the Internet. And so when he says to me   Oh  I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars  or something  I'm like   oh  well  I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars  because they might not all be your friends  and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars.  I mean  they generally are  when you look in the paper  right  So I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are. So okay  you can go in the chatroom  but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names  and they submit full copies of their police report. But of course  if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name  I'd say no. You can't give them your real name. Because what happens if they turn out to be perverts  and teachers and whatever. So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is  but I don't want anybody else to know who he is. And so you get this sort of logjam around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else  but not from yourself. And there's no progress  we get stuck. And so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly  and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity. So on my RSS feed  I saw this thing about   I just said something bad about my RSS feed  didn't I  I should stop saying it like that. For some random reason  I can't imagine  something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox. And I read this story about cheerleaders  and it's a fascinating story. This happened a couple of years ago in the U.S. There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the U.S.  and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach  as I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time  and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this. She was very upset. And so she went to one of the girls  and said   you have to give me your Facebook password.  I read this all the time  where even at some universities and places of education  kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords. So you've got to give them your Facebook password. She was a kid  What she should have said is   my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning. It's an outrageous imposition on my  th Amendment right to privacy  and you're going to be sued for all the money you've got.  That's what she should have said. But she's a kid  so she hands over the password. The teacher can't log into Facebook  because the school has blocked access to Facebook. So the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home. So the girl tells her friends  guess what happened  The teacher logged in  she knows. So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones  and deleted their profiles. And so when the teacher logged in  there was nothing there. My point is  those identities  they don't think about them the same way. Identity is  especially when you're a teenager  a fluid thing. You have lots of identities. And you can have an identity  you don't like it  because it's subverted in some way  or it's insecure  or it's inappropriate  you just delete it and get another one. The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone  the government or whatever  and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places  that's absolutely wrong. Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook  unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way  And it just doesn't work properly. And my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to be   In case you're wondering  that's me at the G   protest. I wasn't actually at the G   protest  but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G   protest  and I got an email from the bank saying please don't wear a suit  because it'll inflame the protesters. I look pretty good in a suit  frankly  so you can see why it would drive them into an anti capitalist frenzy. So I thought  well  look. If I don't want to inflame the protesters  the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester. So I went dressed completely in black  you know  with a black balaclava  I had black gloves on  but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book. I'm wearing black trousers  black boots  I'm dressed completely in black. I go into the bank at    o'clock  go   Hi  I'm Dave Birch  I've got a   o'clock with so and so there.  Sure. They sign me in. There's my visitor's badge. So this nonsense about you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever  that gets you that kind of security. That gets you security theater  where there's no actual security  but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security. And as long as everybody learns their lines  everyone's happy. But it's not real security. Especially because I hate banks more than the G   protesters do  because I work for them. I know that things are actually worse than these guys think. But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something. Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader  and I want to report it to the boss of the bank. So I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing. I send a message  this guy's a rogue trader. That message is meaningless if you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank. If that message just comes from anybody  it has zero information value. There's no point in sending that message. But if I have to prove who I am  I'll never send that message. It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon. That message will only happen if I'm anonymous. So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there  otherwise we don't get where we want to get to. So four issues. So what are we going to do about it  Well  what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell space. And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in     . So we think if we had a card  call it a Facebook login  which proves who you are  and I make you carry it all the time  that solves the problem. And of course  for all those reasons I've just outlined  it doesn't  and it might  actually  make some problems worse. The more times you're forced to use your real identity  certainly in transactional terms  the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted. The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don't need identity  which is actually almost all transactions. Almost all of the transactions you do are not  who are you  They're  are you allowed to drive the car  are you allowed in the building  are you over     etcetera  etcetera. So my suggestion I  like James  think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R   D. I think this is a solvable problem. It's something we can do about. Naturally  in these circumstances  I turn to Doctor Who. Because in this  as in so many other walks of life  Doctor Who has already shown us the answer. So I should say  for some of our foreign visitors  Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England  and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us. And this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper. Come on  you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper. You're not nerds if you say yes. Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper  Oh right  you were in the library the whole time studying I guess. Is that what you're going to tell us  Doctor Who's psychic paper is when you hold up the psychic paper  the person  in their brain  sees the thing that they need to see. So I want to show you a British passport  I hold up the psychic paper  you see a British passport. I want to get into a party  I hold up the psychic paper  I show you a party invitation. You see what you want to see. So what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that  but with one tiny  tiny change  which is that it'll only show you the British passport if I've actually got one. It'll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one. It will only show you that I'm over    if I actually am over   . But nothing else. So you're the bouncer at the pub  you need to know that I'm over     instead of showing you my driving license  which shows you I know how to drive  what my name is  my address  all these kind of things  I show you my psychic paper  and all it tells you is am I over    or not. Right. Is that just a pipe dream  Of course not  otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you. So in order to build that and make it work  I'm only going to name these things  I'll not go into them  we need a plan  which is we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use  to solve all of these problems. We're going to make a utility  the utility has to be universal  you can use it everywhere  I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along. That's a Japanese ATM  the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone. So when you want to draw money out  you put the mobile phone on the ATM  and touch your finger  your fingerprint goes through to the phone  the phone says yes  that's whoever  and the ATM then gives you some money. It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere. It has to be absolutely convenient  that's me going into the pub. All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is  is this person over    and not barred from the pub  And so the idea is  you touch your ID card to the door  and if I am allowed in  it shows my picture  if I'm not allowed in  it shows a red cross. It doesn't disclose any other information. It has to have no special gadgets. That can only mean one thing  following on from Ross's statement  which I agree with completely. If it means no special gadgets  it has to run on a mobile phone. That's the only choice we have  we have to make it work on mobile phones. There are  .  billion mobile phone subscriptions. My favorite statistic of all time  only   billion toothbrushes in the world. That means something  I don't know what. I rely on our futurologists to tell me. It has to be a utility which is extensible. So it has to be something that anybody could build on. Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure  you don't need permissions  licenses  whatever  anyone should be able to write some code to do this. You know what symmetry is  so you don't need a picture of it. This is how we're going to do it. We're going to do it using phones  and we're going to do it using mobile proximity. I'm going to suggest to you the technology to implement Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here  and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it  you've already got that technology. If you've ever been up to the big city  and used an Oyster card at all  does that ring any bells to anybody  The technology already exists. The first phones that have the technology built in  the Google Nexus  the S   the Samsung Wifi  .   the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops. So the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom's door and he can show my mom his phone  and she can tap it with her phone  and it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in  and it'll come up with red if he isn't  end of story. We have the technology to do that. And what's more  although some of those things sounded a bit counter intuitive  like proving I'm over    without proving who I am  the cryptography to do that not only exists  it's extremely well known and well understood. Digital signatures  the blinding of public key certificates  these technologies have been around for a while  we've just had no way of packaging them up. So the technology already exists. We know it works  There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places. That's London Fashion Week  where we built a system with O   that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park  you can see the persons walking in with their VIP band  it's just being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band. I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic  this stuff works in these environments. They don't need to be special. So finally  I know that you can do this  because if you saw the episode of Doctor Who  the Easter special of Doctor Who  where he went to Mars in a bus  I should say again for our foreign students  that doesn't happen every episode. This was a very special case. So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  I can't show you the clip  due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne style copyright by the BBC  but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus  Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper. Which proves that psychic paper has an MSE interface. Thank you very much. All right. So  like all good stories  this starts a long  long time ago when there was basically nothing. So here is a complete picture of the universe about    odd billion years ago. All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy. For some reason it explodes  and you begin to get these things. So you're now about    billion years into this. And these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies  and you get trillions of them. And within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds. And I want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture. If you take a close up of those  they look like this. And what you're looking at is columns of dust where there's so much dust    by the way  the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles    and what's happening is there's so much dust  it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction. And so what you're watching is the birth of stars. These are stars being born out of here. When enough stars come out  they create a galaxy. This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy  because you are here. And as you take a close up of this galaxy  you find a relatively normal  not particularly interesting star. By the way  you're now about two thirds of the way into this story. So this star doesn't even appear until about two thirds of the way into this story. And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star  it becomes a planet. And this is about a little over four billion years ago. And soon thereafter there's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup  and that creates life. And life starts to expand and expand and expand  until it goes kaput. Now the really strange thing is life goes kaput  not once  not twice  but five times. So almost all life on Earth is wiped out about five times. And as you're thinking about that  what happens is you get more and more complexity  more and more stuff to build new things with. And we don't appear until about   .   percent of the time into this story  just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective. So within that context  there's two theories of the case as to why we're all here. The first theory of the case is that's all she wrote. Under that theory  we are the be all and end all of all creation. And the reason for trillions of galaxies  sextillions of planets  is to create something that looks like that and something that looks like that. And that's the purpose of the universe  and then it flat lines  it doesn't get any better. The only question you might want to ask yourself is  could that be just mildly arrogant  And if it is    and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction. There were only about       of our species left. A few more weeks without rain  we would have never seen any of these. So maybe you have to think about a second theory if the first one isn't good enough. Second theory is  Could we upgrade  Well  why would one ask a question like that  Because there have been at least    upgrades so far of humanoids. So it turns out that we have upgraded. We've upgraded time and again and again. And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades. We found this one last year. We found another one last month. And as you're thinking about this  you might also ask the question  So why a single human species  Wouldn't it be really odd if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica and found exactly the same bird    particularly given that we co existed at the same time with at least eight other versions of humanoid at the same time on this planet  So the normal state of affairs is not to have just a Homo sapiens  the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around. And if that is the normal state of affairs  then you might ask yourself  all right  so if we want to create something else  how big does a mutation have to be  Well Svante Paabo has the answer. The difference between humans and Neanderthal is  .    percent of gene code. That's how big the difference is one species to another. This explains most contemporary political debates. But as you're thinking about this  one of the interesting things is how small these mutations are and where they take place. Difference human Neanderthal is sperm and testis  smell and skin. And those are the specific genes that differ from one to the other. So very small changes can have a big impact. And as you're thinking about this  we're continuing to mutate. So about        years ago by the Black Sea  we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes. And this is continuing and continuing and continuing. And as it continues  one of the things that's going to happen this year is we're going to discover the first        human genomes  because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing. And when we find these  we may find differences. And by the way  this is not a debate that we're ready for  because we have really misused the science in this. In the     s  we thought there were major differences between people. That was partly based on Francis Galton's work. He was Darwin's cousin. But the U.S.  the Carnegie Institute  Stanford  American Neurological Association took this really far. That got exported and was really misused. In fact  it led to some absolutely horrendous treatment of human beings. So since the     s  we've been saying there are no differences  we're all identical. We're going to know at year end if that is true. And as we think about that  we're actually beginning to find things like  do you have an ACE gene  Why would that matter  Because nobody's ever climbed an       meter peak without oxygen that doesn't have an ACE gene. And if you want to get more specific  how about a    R genotype  Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested carries at least one of these variants. If that is true  it leads to some very complicated questions for the London Olympics. Three options  Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants  Option number two  Why don't we play it like golf or sailing  Because you have one and you don't have one  I'll give you a tenth of a second head start. Version number three  Because this is a naturally occurring gene and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents  you get the right to upgrade. Three different options. If these differences are the difference between an Olympic medal and a non Olympic medal. And it turns out that as we discover these things  we human beings really like to change how we look  how we act  what our bodies do. And we had about   .  million plastic surgeries in the United States  except that with the technologies that are coming online today  today's corrections  deletions  augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child's play. You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED  but this ability to start filling things like inkjet cartridges with cells are allowing us to print skin  organs and a whole series of other body parts. And as these technologies go forward  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing this  you keep seeing things          human genome sequence    and it seems like nothing's happening  until it does. And we may just be in some of these weeks. And as you're thinking about these two guys sequencing a human genome in      and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in       then you don't hear a lot  until you hear about an experiment last year in China  where they take skin cells from this mouse  put four chemicals on it  turn those skin cells into stem cells  let the stem cells grow and create a full copy of that mouse. That's a big deal. Because in essence what it means is you can take a cell  which is a pluripotent stem cell  which is like a skier at the top of a mountain  and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells  four  eight      and then it gets so crowded after    divisions that those cells have to differentiate. So they go down one side of the mountain  they go down another. And as they pick that  these become bone  and then they pick another road and these become platelets  and these become macrophages  and these become T cells. But it's really hard  once you ski down  to get back up. Unless  of course  if you have a ski lift. And what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part. And as you think of that  what it means is potentially you can rebuild a full copy of any organism out of any one of its cells. That turns out to be a big deal because now you can take  not just mouse cells  but you can human skin cells and turn them into human stem cells. And then what they did in October is they took skin cells  turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells. So in theory  you could grow any organ from any one of your cells. Here's a second experiment  If you could photocopy your body  maybe you also want to take your mind. And one of the things you saw at TED about a year and a half ago was this guy. And he gave a wonderful technical talk. He's a professor at MIT. But in essence what he said is you can take retroviruses  which get inside brain cells of mice. You can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them. And you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees  feels  touches  remembers  loves. And then you can take a fiber optic cable and light up some of the same things. And by the way  as you do this  you can image it in two colors  which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer. So what's the bottom line on that  Well it's not completely inconceivable that someday you'll be able to download your own memories  maybe into a new body. And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well. And this might have just one or two small ethical  political  moral implications. Just a thought. Here's the kind of questions that are becoming interesting questions for philosophers  for governing people  for economists  for scientists. Because these technologies are moving really quickly. And as you think about it  let me close with an example of the brain. The first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today  both because of the inputs  which are becoming massive  and because of the plasticity of the organ  is the brain. Do we have any evidence that that is happening  Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand. Here's what it looks like in     . Here's what it looks like in                 . Here's the increase in less than a decade. And we still don't know why this is happening. What we do know is  potentially  the brain is reacting in a hyperactive  hyper plastic way  and creating individuals that are like this. And this is only one of the conditions that's out there. You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart  people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives  people who've got synesthesia  people who've got schizophrenia. You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there  and we still don't understand how and why this is happening. But one question you might want to ask is  are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data  Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains  we're trying to take in as much data in a day as people used to take in in a lifetime. And as you're thinking about this  there's four theories as to why this might be going on  plus a whole series of others. I don't have a good answer. There really needs to be more research on this. One option is the fast food fetish. There's beginning to be some evidence that obesity and diet have something to do with gene modifications  which may or may not have an impact on how the brain of an infant works. A second option is the sexy geek option. These conditions are highly rare. But what's beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together  because they are highly qualified for computer programming and it is highly remunerated  as well as other very detail oriented tasks  that they are concentrating geographically and finding like minded mates. So this is the assortative mating hypothesis of these genes reinforcing one another in these structures. The third  is this too much information  We're trying to process so much stuff that some people get synesthetic and just have huge pipes that remember everything. Other people get hyper sensitive to the amount of information. Other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information. Or maybe it's chemicals. But when you see an increase of that order of magnitude in a condition  either you're not measuring it right or there's something going on very quickly  and it may be evolution in real time. Here's the bottom line. What I think we are doing is we're transitioning as a species. And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together. I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis that  for better or worse  is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment  it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species  of bacteria  of plants  of animals. And I think that's such an order of magnitude change that your grandkids or your great grandkids may be a species very different from you. Thank you very much. When I go to parties  it doesn't usually take very long for people to find out that I'm a scientist and I study sex. And then I get asked questions. And the questions usually have a very particular format. They start with the phrase   A friend told me   and then they end with the phrase   Is this true   And most of the time I'm glad to say that I can answer them  but sometimes I have to say   I'm really sorry  but I don't know because I'm not that kind of a doctor.  That is  I'm not a clinician  I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy. And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything's going right  rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong  like so many of you. And what I do is I look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they've evolved for fundamental biological problems. So today I'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric Ivory Tower activity that we find at our universities  but that broad study across species  tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health. And this is true both of my recent project on sex differences in the brain  and my more mature work on the anatomy and function of penises. And now you know why I'm fun at parties. So today I'm going to give you an example drawn from my penis study to show you how knowledge drawn from studies of one organ system provided insights into a very different one. Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows    I did have to explain it to my nine year old late last week    penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another. And the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals. There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation. You find muscular tubes  modified legs  modified fins  as well as the mammalian fleshy  inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with    or at least half of you are. And I think we see this tremendous variation because it's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem  and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes. Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion  but when internal fertilization evolves  penises often follow. And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is   What made you interested in this subject   And the answer is skeletons. You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another. And that's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power. And my first forays into biological research  doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate  were really squarely in that realm. But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics  I really wanted to find a dissertation project that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function. I tried a bunch of different stuff. A lot of it didn't pan out. But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis. And it's really an odd sort of structure. Before it can be used for internal fertilization  its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion. Most of the time it's a flexible organ. It's easy to bend. But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid  it has to become difficult to bend. And moreover  it has to work. A reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring  and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool. And so I thought   Here's a problem that just cries out for a skeletal system    not one like this one  but one like this one    because  functionally  a skeleton is any system that supports tissue and transmits forces. And I already knew that animals like this earthworm  indeed most animals  don't support their tissues by draping them over bones. Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons. They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton. And a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements. The skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins. And the interaction is crucial. Without both elements you have no support. If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up  you have a puddle. And if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension  you've got a little wet rag. When you look at a penis in cross section  it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton. It has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid    in this case blood    surrounded by a wall of tissue that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen. But at the time when I started this project  the best explanation I could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues  and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila  it became erect. And that explained to me expansion    made sense  more fluid  you get tissues that expand    but it didn't actually explain erection. Because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend. And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue. So I thought  wall tissue's important in skeletons. It has to be part of the explanation. And this was the point at which my graduate adviser said   Whoa  Hold on. Slow down.  Because after about six months of me talking about this  I think he finally figured out that I was really serious about the penis thing. So he sat me down  and he warned me. He was like   Be careful going down this path. I'm not sure this project's going to pan out.  Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap. I was taking on a socially embarrassing question with an answer that he thought might not be particularly interesting. And that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements. It had the central fluid  it had the surrounding wall  and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton. So the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall. The arrow shows you the long axis. And you can see two layers of fibers  one in blue and one in yellow  arranged in left handed and right handed angles. And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers  those fibers would be going in helices around the long axis of the skeleton    something like a Chinese finger trap  where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck. And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors  which I'm going to demonstrate in a film. It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon. The cloth's cut on the bias. So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices  and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves  which means the skeleton's flexible. It lengthens  shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces. Now my adviser's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton. What are you going to contribute  What new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology  And I thought   Yeah  he does have a really good point here.  So I spent a long  long time thinking about it. And one thing kept bothering me  and that's  when they're functioning  penises don't wiggle. So something interesting had to be going on. So I went ahead  collected wall tissue  prepared it so it was erect  sectioned it  put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look  fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety. But instead I saw this. There's an outer layer and an inner layer. The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton. I was really surprised at this. Everyone I showed it was really surprised at this. Why was everyone surprised at this  That's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton  and that was with fibers at zero degrees and    degrees to the long axis of the structure. The thing is  no one had ever seen it before in nature. And now I was looking at one. Those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very  very different behavior. I'm going to show a model made out of exactly the same materials. So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth  same balloon  same internal pressure. But the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently. And you'll see that  unlike the cross helical model  this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending. Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues. They're an integral part of the penile skeleton. If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there  if it wasn't reinforced in this way  the shape would change  but the inflated penis would not resist bending  and erection simply wouldn't work. It's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well  but it's also relevant in a broad sense  I think  to the design of prosthetics  soft robots  basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important. So to sum up  Twenty years ago  I had a college adviser tell me  when I went to the college and said   I'm kind of interested in anatomy   they said   Anatomy's a dead science.  He couldn't have been more wrong. I really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies. Not just about its genetics and molecular biology  but up here in the meat end of the scale. We've got limits on our time. We often focus on one disease  one model  one problem  but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us. After all  if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems  there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found. Thank you. I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. The question is  Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown  Now I know we learned that in math class  but now it's everywhere in the culture    The X prize  the X Files  Project X  TEDx. Where'd that come from  About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic  which turns out to be a supremely logical language. To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation  because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. This includes the little system in Arabic called al jebra. And al jebr roughly translates to  the system for reconciling disparate parts.  Al jebr finally came into English as algebra. One example among many. The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe    which is to say Spain    in the   th and   th centuries. And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language. But there were problems. One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice. Trust me on that one. Also  those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. Here's one of the culprits. This is the letter SHeen  and it makes the sound we think of as SH     sh.  It's also the very first letter of the word shalan  which means  something  just like the the English word  something     some undefined  unknown thing. Now in Arabic  we can make this definite by adding the definite article  al.  So this is al shalan    the unknown thing. And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics  such as this   th century derivation of proofs. The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH  that  sh  sound. So by convention  they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound   ck  sound  from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. Later when this material was translated into a common European language  which is to say Latin  they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened  once this material was in Latin  it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost     years. But now we have the answer to our question. Why is it that X is the unknown  X is the unknown because you can't say  sh  in Spanish. And I thought that was worth sharing. I collaborate with bacteria. And I'm about to show you some stop motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour. So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing  and as they do so they create an electrical charge. And this attracts metals from their local environment. And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria. One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water. And the desalination process is one where we take out salts. We can use it for drinking and agriculture. Removing the salts from water    particularly seawater    through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe. So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology. We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure. And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane. This takes energy  producing clean water. But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution  or brine. But the process is very expensive and it's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe. And also  the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea. And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into. So I work in Singapore at the moment  and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology. And Singapore proposes by      to produce       million liters per day of desalinated water. But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine. And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play. So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium  potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine. And this  in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned  equates to a   .  billion mining industry for Singapore    a place that doesn't have any natural resources. So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before  imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth  imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine. And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube  a mining industry that is in harmony with nature. Thank you. Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design  and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature. But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs  so I pretty much know everything there is. Now  I'm sure you recognize this object  many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days. This is known as the Theme Building  that is its name for reasons that are still very murky. And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture. It was first excavated in      as they were building LAX  although scientists believe that it dates back to the year      Before Common Era  when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants. It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located  of course  at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design  the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously  the much better access to parking. When it was uncovered  it ushered in a new era of streamlined  archaically futuristic design called Googie  which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age  a misnomer. After all  the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often  preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls. Ah yes  a table. We use these every day. And on top of it  the juicy salif. This is a design by Philippe Starck  who I believe is in the audience at this very moment. And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision  its playfulness  its innovation and its promise of imminent violence. It is a design that challenges your intuition    it is not what you think it is when you first see it. It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time  which would be useful out in the lobby  I would say. And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism  it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts. It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that  you never see it as anything else again. It is also not a monument to design  it is a monument to design's utility. You can take it home with you  unlike the Theme Building  which will stay where it is forever. This is affordable and can come home with you and  as such  it can sit on your kitchen counter    it can't go in your drawers  trust me  I found that out the hard way    and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design. One other thing about it  if you do have one at home  let me tell you one of the features you may not know  when you fall asleep  it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep. Okay  what is this object  I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is. It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate  I don't get it. Does anyone know  Chi  It's an ... iPhone. iPhone. Oh yes  that's right  I remember those  I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days. No  I have an iPhone. Of course I do. Here is my well loved iPhone. I do so many things on this little device. I like to read books on it. More than that  I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect. I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox  for example. Every now and then  I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally. And yet I forget about it all the time. This is a design that once you saw it  you forgot about it. It is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in      when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life. Unlike the Theme Building  this is not alien technology. Or I should say  what it did was it took technology which  unlike people in this room  to many other people in the world  still feels very alien  and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate. And unlike the juicy salif  it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain  rather  it simply attaches itself to your brain. And you didn't even notice it happened. So there you go. My name is John Hodgman. I just explained design. Thank you very much. I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement  to resonate other people's feelings  thoughts  intentions  motivations  in the act of being with them. As a scientist  I always wanted to measure that resonance  that sense of the other that happens so quickly  in the blink of an eye. We intuit other people's feelings. We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen. We're always in this stance of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity. We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off. It's so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves  to understand the world around them  is shaped by that stance. We are social to the core. So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism. Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals. This is a long time ago. And for them  autism was devastating. They had profound intellectual disabilities. They didn't talk. But most of all  they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them  from their environment and from the people. In fact  at the time  if you walked into a school for individuals with autism  you'd hear a lot of noise  plenty of commotion  actions  people doing things  but they're always doing things by themselves. So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling  or they may be isolated in the corner  or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements  in self stimulatory movements that led them nowhere. Extremely  extremely isolated. Well  now we know that autism is this disruption  the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you. These are survival skills. These are survival skills that we inherited over many  many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. You see  babies are born in a state of utter fragility. Without the caregiver  they wouldn't survive  so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival. They orient to the caregiver. From the first days and weeks of life  babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment. They prefer to look at people rather than at things  and even as they're looking at people  they look at people's eyes  because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences  so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away. Well  they orient to the caregiver. The caregiver seeks the baby. And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind  the social mind  the social brain  depends on. We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life. It doesn't. It begins with the beginning of life. As babies engage with caregivers  they soon realize that  well  there is something in between the ears that is very important    it's invisible  you can't see    but is really critical  and that thing is called attention. And they learn soon enough  even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want. They also learn to follow other people's gaze  because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about. And soon enough  they start to learn about the meaning of things  because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something  they're not just getting a directional cue  they are getting the other person's meaning of that thing  the attitude  and soon enough they start building this body of meanings  but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction. Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others. Well  this is a little    month old little girl  and she has autism. And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face  and she's quite oblivious to me. Imagine if I did that to you  and I came two inches from your face. You'd do probably two things  wouldn't you  You would recoil. You would call the police.  Laughter  You would do something  because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get a reaction. We do so  remember  intuitively  effortlessly. This is our body wisdom. It's not something that is mediated by our language. Our body just knows that  and we've known that for a long time. And this is not something that happens to humans only. It happens to some of our phylatic cousins  because if you're a monkey  and you look at another monkey  and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you  and that is considered to be a signal or threat  well  you are not going to be alive for long. So something that in other species are survival mechanisms  without them they wouldn't basically live  we bring into the context of human beings  and this is what we need to simply act  act socially. Now  she is oblivious to me  and I am so close to her  and you think  maybe she can see you  maybe she can hear you. Well  a few minutes later  she goes to the corner of the room  and she finds a tiny little piece of candy  an M M. So I could not attract her attention  but something  a thing  did. Now  most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people. Now  for this girl  that division line is not so clear  and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like. Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences. Now  what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further. So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic  the brain determines who we are going to be. But in fact the brain also becomes who we are  and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction  this is what's happening with her mind and this is what's happening with her brain. Well  autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders  and it's a brain disorder. It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born. We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism. There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled  but there are those that are gifted. There are those individuals who don't talk at all. There are those individuals who talk too much. There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school  you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them  to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly  relentlessly  but often in an awkward fashion  without that immediate resonance. Well  this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time. When I started in this field  we thought that there were four individuals with autism per         a very rare condition. Well  now we know it's more like one in    . There are millions of individuals with autism all around us. The societal cost of this condition is huge. In the U.S. alone  maybe    to    billion dollars  and you know what  Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled  individuals who need wrap around services  services that are very  very intensive  and those services can cost in excess of    to        dollars a year. Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment  because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you. Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point  and intervene and treat  I can tell you  and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past    years  this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition. Also  we have a window of opportunity  because the brain is malleable for just so long  and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life. It's not that that window closes. It doesn't. But it diminishes considerably. And yet  the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years  and in disadvantaged populations  the populations that don't have access to clinical services  rural populations  minorities  the age of diagnosis is later still  which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe. So I feel that we have a bio ethical imperative. The science is there  but no science is of relevance if it doesn't have an impact on the community  and we just can't afford that missed opportunity  because children with autism become adults with autism  and we feel that those things that we can do for these children  for those families  early on  will have lifetime consequences  for the child  for the family  and for the community at large. So this is our view of autism. There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism. In fact  we believe that there are going to be something between     and     genes associated with autism  and genetic anomalies  much more than just genes. And we actually have a bit of a question here  because if there are so many different causes of autism  how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome  Because people like myself  when we walk into a playroom  we recognize a child as having autism. So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity  And the answer is  what lies in between  which is development. And in fact  we are very interested in those first two years of life  because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism. Autism creates itself. Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life  we might attenuate for some  and God knows  maybe even prevent for others. So how do we do that  How do we enter that feeling of resonance  how do we enter another person's being  I remember when I interacted with that    month older  that the thing that came to mind was   How do you come into her world  Is she thinking about me  Is she thinking about others   Well  it's hard to do that  so we had to create the technologies. We had to basically step inside a body. We had to see the world through her eyes. And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking. We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with. Well  this is my colleague Warren Jones  with whom we've been building these methods  these studies  for the past    years  and you see there a happy five month older  it's a five month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world  his mom  the caregiver  but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare. What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory  but in order for us to do that  we had to create these very sophisticated measures  measures of how people  how little babies  how newborns  engage with the world  moment by moment  what is important  and what is not. Well  we created those measures  and here  what you see is what we call a funnel of attention. You're watching a video. Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of    typically developing two year olds  and we freeze one frame  and this is what the typical children are doing. In this scan pass  in green here  are two year olds with autism. So on that frame  the children who are typical are watching this  the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl. What are the children with autism doing  They are focusing on the revolving door  opening and shutting. Well  I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five minute experiment. It happens moment by moment in their real lives  and their minds are being formed  and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers. Well  we took a construct from our pediatrician friends  the concept of growth charts. You know  when you take a child to the pediatrician  and so you have physical height  and weight. Well we decided that we're going to create growth charts of social engagement  and we sought children from the time that they are born  and what you see here on the x axis is two  three  four  five  six months and nine  until about the age of    months  and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people's eyes  and this is their growth chart. They start over here  they love people's eyes  and it remains quite stable. It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months. Now  let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic. It's something very different. It starts way up here  but then it's a free fall. It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people  but it has no traction. It's almost as if that stimulus  you  you're not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives. Now  we thought that those data were so powerful in a way  that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life  because if you interact with a two  and a three month older  you'd be surprised by how social those babies are. And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily. And using these kinds of measures  and many others  what we found out is that our science could  in fact  identify this condition early on. We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life. If we measured things that are  evolutionarily  highly conserved  and developmentally very early emerging  things that are online from the first weeks of life  we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months  and that's what we are doing now. Now  we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children  but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community. Now we want those devices  of course  to be deployed by those who are in the trenches  our colleagues  the primary care physicians  who see every child  and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice  because they have to see so many children. And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child  but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention  for treatment. We need to be able to work with the families  to support the families  to manage those first years with them. We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment  because those treatments are going to change these children's and those families' lives. Now  when we think about what we  can  do in those first years  I can tell you  having been in this field for so long  one feels really rejuvenated. There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities  preventing  in fact  those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field. I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition. No longer. We can do a great deal of things. And the idea is not to cure autism. That's not the idea. What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times  the profound intellectual disabilities  the lack of language  the profound  profound isolation. We feel that individuals with autism  in fact  have a very special perspective on the world  and we need diversity  and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength  predictable situations  situations that can be defined. Because after all  they learn about the world almost like about it  rather than learning how to function in it. But this is a strength  if you're working  for example  in technology. And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities. We want them to be free of that. We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise. Well thank you for listening to me.  Applause  I am no designer  nope  no way. My dad was  which is kind of an interesting way to grow up. I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important. Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up  you know   Bad design is just people not thinking  John   he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or  say  a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen. You know   Design    bad design  there's just no excuse for it. It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it. Every object should be about something  John. It should imagine a user. It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object. Good design   my dad said   is about supplying intent.  That's what he said. Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM     computer. That was a big deal  that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while  that was important. He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase  that was important. I knew design was important in my house because  for heaven's sake  it put food on our table  right  And design was in everything my dad did. He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up  and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes. And I would ask him every once in a while   Dad  do you want it to sound like the record   We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house. And he said   No  never  John  never. The song is just a given  that's how you have to think about it. You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it. Show everyone what you intend   is what he said.  Doing that  acting by design  is what we all should be doing. It's where we all belong.  All of us  Designers  Oh  oh  Dad. Oh  Dad. The song is just a given. It's how you cover it that matters. Well  let's hold on to that thought for just a minute. It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in  right  The original tune  It's a little scary.  Ooh  what happened to that dude  He can't walk. Anybody know the story  Anybody   I don't like to talk about this very much  but I'll tell you guys the story today. All right  exactly    years ago this week  that's right  I was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania  and plummeted down a     foot embankment and killed two people in the car. But ever since then  the wheelchair has been a given in my life. My life  at the mercy of good design and bad design. Think about it. Now  in design terms  a wheelchair is a very difficult object. It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune  and it projects that message  that story  so strongly that it almost blots out anything else. I roll swiftly through an airport  right  And moms grab their kids out of the way and say   Don't stare   The poor kid  you know  has this terrified look on his face  God knows what they think. And for decades  I'm going  why does this happen  What can I do about it  How can I change this  I mean there must be something. So I would roll  I'd make no eye contact    just kinda frown  right  Or I'd dress up really  really sharply or something. Or I'd make eye contact with everyone    that was really creepy  that didn't work at all. You know anything  I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week    nothing worked. Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago  my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had  and they said   Oh  Dad  Dad  Look  you gotta get these  these flashy wheels    you gotta get 'em   And I said   Oh  girls  Dad is a very important journalist  that just wouldn't do at all.  And of course  they immediately concluded   Oh  what a bummer  Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels. I mean  how important could you be then   they said. I went   Wait a minute  all right  right    I'll get the wheels.  Purely out of protest  I got the flashy wheels  and I installed them and    check this out. Could I have my special light cue please  Look at that  Now ... look at  look at this  Look at this  So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life  I mean totally changed my life. Instead of blank stares and awkwardness  now it is pointing and smiling  People going   Awesome wheels  dude  Those are awesome  I mean  I want some of those wheels   Little kids say   Can I have a ride   And of course there's the occasional person    usually a middle aged male who will say   Oh  those wheels are great  I guess they're for safety  right   No  They're not for safety. No  no  no  no  no. What's the difference here  the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights  The difference is intent. That's right  that's right  I'm no longer a victim. I chose to change the situation    I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right  Intent changes the picture completely. I choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element. Acting with intent. It conveys authorship. It suggests that someone is driving. It's reassuring  people are drawn to it. Someone making the experience their own. Covering the tragic tune with something different  something radically different. People respond to that. Now it seems simple  but actually I think in our society and culture in general  we have a huge problem with intent. Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is  It's Anders Breivik. Now  if he intended to kill in Olso  Norway last year  dozens and dozens of young people    if he intended to do that  he's a vicious criminal. We punish him. Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States  not so much in Norway. But  if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy  if he was motivated by some random mental illness  he's in a completely different category. We may put him away for life  but we watch him clinically. It's a completely different domain. As an intentional murderer  Anders Breivik is merely evil. But as a dysfunctional  as a dysfunctional murderer psychotic  he's something much more complicated. He's the breath of some primitive  ancient chaos. He's the random state of nature we emerged from. He's something very  very different. It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity. It's what we're supposed to do somehow. We're supposed to act with intent. We're supposed to do things by design. Intent is a marker for civilization. Now here's an example a little closer to home  My family is all about intent. You can probably tell there are two sets of twins  the result of IVF technology  in vitro fertilization technology  due to some physical limitations I won't go into. Anyway  in vitro technology  IVF  is about as intentional as agriculture. Let me tell you  some of you may have the experience. In fact  the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian. I met the dude. He's a great guy. He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he'd worked with  all the different animals. Probes he designed  and in fact  he was really  really proud of these probes. He would say   You're right between horse and squirrel  John.  But anyway  so when my wife and I decided to upgrade our early middle age    we had four kids  after all    with a little different technology that I won't explain in too much detail here    my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.  No need for birth control  Doc  are you sure about that    John  John  I looked at your chart. From your sperm tests we can confidently say that you're basically a form of birth control.  Well  What a liberating thought  Yes  And after a couple very liberating weekends  my wife and I  utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday but I won't get into it now  we noticed some familiar  if unexpected  symptoms. I wasn't exactly a form of birth control. Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed. I mean  did a designer come up with that  No  I don't think a designer did come up with that. In fact  maybe that's the problem. And so  little Ajax was born. He's like our other children  but the experience is completely different. It's something like my accident  right  He came out of nowhere. But we all had to change  but not just react to the given  we bend to this new experience with intent. We're five now. Five. Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design. Hey  the name Ajax    you can't get much more intentional than that  right  We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on. But I never became a designer. No  no  no  no. Never attempted. Never even close. I did love some great designs as I was growing up  The HP   S calculator    God  I loved that thing. Oh God  I wish I had one. Man  I love that thing. I could afford that. Other designs I really couldn't afford  like the          Targa. In school  I studied nothing close to design or engineering  I studied useless things like the Classics  but there were some lessons even there    this guy  Plato  it turns out he's a designer. He designed a state in  The Republic   a design never implemented. Listen to one of the design features of Plato's Government  .    The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed  and the State in which they are most eager  the worst.  Well  got that wrong  didn't we  But look at that statement  it's all about intent. That's what I love about it. But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing  It's a grand idea of design    a huge idea of design  common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period. What was going on then  They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive  As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos  a confrontation with random  brutal nature  they suddenly had a moment to think    and there was a lot to think about. All of a sudden  human existence needed an intent. Human life needed a reason. Reality itself needed a designer. The given was replaced by various aspects of intent  by various designs  by various gods. Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah. Today we don't confront the chaos of nature. Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront. This young discipline called design  I think  is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question  What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created  What shall we do  How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create  on all the circumstances we create  on all the places we change  The consequences of a planet with   billion people and counting. That's the tune we're all covering today  all of us. And we can't just imitate the past. No. That won't do. That won't do at all. Here's my favorite design moment  In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the     s  I was working for ABC News  and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko  the dictator  the brutal dictator in Zaire  who raped and pillaged that country. There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa. The place was falling apart  it was a horrible  horrible place  and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting. People were carrying off vehicles  carrying off pieces of buildings. Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests. In the middle of this chaos  I'm rolling around in a wheelchair  and I was completely invisible. Completely. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a looter. I was in a wheelchair  I didn't look like a journalist  particularly  at least from their perspective. And I didn't look like a soldier  that's for sure. I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire  completely invisible. And all of a sudden  from around a corner  comes this young man  paralyzed  just like me  in this metal and wood and leather pedal  three wheel tricycle wheelchair device  and he pedals up to me as fast as he can. He goes   Hey  mister  Mister   And I looked at him    he didn't know any other English than that  but we didn't need English  no  no  no  no  no. We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes. And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism  he was full of pride over his design. I wish I could show you that contraption. His smile  our glow as we talked a universal language of design  invisible to the chaos around us. His machine  homemade  bolted  rusty  comical. My machine  American made  confident  sleek. He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat  really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge. Oh  I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him  man  He would have loved those  Oh yeah. He would have understood those  a chariot of pure intent    think about it    in a city out of control. Design blew it all away for a moment. We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos. He went back to the streets of Kinshasa  I went to my hotel. And I think of him now  now ... And I pose this question. An object imbued with intent    it has power  it's treasure  we're drawn to it. An object devoid of intent    it's random  it's imitative  it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away. This is what we must demand of our lives  of our objects  of our things  of our circumstances  living with intent. And I have to say that on that score  I have a very unfair advantage over all of you. And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day. Thirty six years ago at nearly this moment  a    year old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question  but the nurse was already there with an answer.  You've had a terrible accident  young man. You've broken your back. You'll never walk again.  I said   I know all that    what day is it   You see  I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the   th of February  and I knew that      was a leap year.  Nurse  Is this the   th or the   th   And she looked at me and said   It's March  st.  And I went   Oh my God. I've got some catching up to do   And from that moment  I knew the given was that accident  I had no option but to make up this new life without walking. Intent    a life with intent    lived by design  covering the original with something better. It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times. To get back to this  to get back to design  and as my daddy suggested a long time ago   Make the song your own  John. Show everybody what you intend.  Daddy  this one's for you.   Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner     but he was another man.     Jo Jo left his home in Tucson  Arizona to attend a California bash.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.     Get back  get back      get back to where you once belonged.   So my freshman year of college I signed up for an internship in the housing unit at Greater Boston Legal Services. Showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies  but was paired with this righteous  deeply inspired attorney named Jeff Purcell  who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day. And over the course of nine months I had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in Boston who would come in presenting with housing issues  but always had an underlying health issue. So I had a client who came in  about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent. But he hasn't paid his rent  of course  because he's paying for his HIV medication and just can't afford both. We had moms who would come in  daughter has asthma  wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning. And one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass bottles. And I would collect the cockroaches  hot glue gun them to this poster board that we'd bring to court for our cases. And we always won because the judges were just so grossed out. Far more effective  I have to say  than anything I later learned in law school. But over the course of these nine months  I grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far downstream in the lives of our clients    that by the time they came to us  they were already in crisis. And at the end of my freshman year of college  I read an article about the work that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing as Chair of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center. And his first hire was a legal services attorney to represent the patients. So I called Barry  and with his blessing  in October      walked into the waiting room of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center. I'll never forget  the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons. And the exhaustion of mothers who had taken two  three  sometimes four buses to bring their child to the doctor was just palpable. The doctors  it seemed  never really had enough time for all the patients  try as they might. And over the course of six months  I would corner them in the hallway and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question   If you had unlimited resources  what's the one thing you would give your patients   And I heard the same story again and again  a story we've heard hundreds of times since then. They said   Every day we have patients that come into the clinic    child has an ear infection  I prescribe antibiotics. But the real issue is there's no food at home. The real issue is that child is living with    other people in a two bedroom apartment. And I don't even ask about those issues because there's nothing I can do. I have    minutes with each patient. Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room. I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is. And I don't even have any help.  In that clinic  even today  there are two social workers for        pediatric patients  which is better than a lot of the clinics out there. So Health Leads was born of these conversations    a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food  heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication. Patients then take their prescriptions to our desk in the clinic waiting room where we have a core of well trained college student advocates who work side by side with these families to connect them out to the existing landscape of community resources. So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room    totally lemonade stand style. But today we have a thousand college student advocates who are working to connect nearly       patients and their families with the resources that they need to be healthy. So    months ago I got this email that changed my life. And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger  who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads and to share  as he said  a bit of historical context. In      Dr. Geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country  in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta. And so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them. And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket  which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic. And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington  D.C.    which was funding Geiger's clinic    found out about this  they were furious. And they sent this bureaucrat down to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care    to which Geiger famously and logically responded   The last time I checked my textbooks  the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.  So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger  I knew I was supposed to be proud to be part of this history. But the truth is I was devastated. Here we are     years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients  and I have doctors telling me   On those issues  we practice a 'don't ask  don't tell' policy.  Forty five years after Geiger  Health Leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources. So I have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day. How is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients  and especially low income patients  healthy  that we didn't use it  If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system  why don't we just do it  These questions  in my mind  are not hard because the answers are complicated  they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves. My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system  or even admit that we have any at all. Because if we did  they would be so removed from our current reality. But that doesn't change my belief that all of us  deep inside  here in this room and across this country  share a similar set of desires. That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly  that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare  that it keep us healthy. This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one. And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system. It's just a set of choices that people make. What if we decided to make a different set of choices  What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare that have drifted away from us and stand firm and say   No. These things are ours. They will be used for our purposes. They will be used to realize our aspiration   What if everything we needed to realize our aspiration for healthcare was right there in front of us just waiting to be claimed  So that's where Health Leads began. We started with the prescription pad    a very ordinary piece of paper    and we asked  not what do patients need to get healthy    antibiotics  an inhaler  medication    but what do patients need to be healthy  to not get sick in the first place  And we chose to use the prescription for that purpose. So just a few miles from here at Children's National Medical Center  when patients come into the doctor's office  they're asked a few questions. They're asked   Are you running out of food at the end of the month  Do you have safe housing   And when the doctor begins the visit  she knows height  weight  is there food at home  is the family living in a shelter. And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices  but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient  using Health Leads like any other sub specialty referral. The problem is  once you get a taste of what it's like to realize your aspiration for healthcare  you want more. So we thought  if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients  could we get an entire healthcare system to shift its presumption  And we gave it a shot. So now at Harlem Hospital Center when patients come in with an elevated body mass index  the electronic medical record automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads. And our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities. We've created a presumption that if you're a patient at that hospital with an elevated BMI  the four walls of the doctor's office probably aren't going to give you everything you need to be healthy. You need more. So on the one hand  this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record. And on the other hand  it's a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a static repository of diagnostic information to a health promotion tool. In the private sector  when you squeeze that kind of additional value out of a fixed cost investment  it's called a billion dollar company. But in my world  it's called reduced obesity and diabetes. It's called healthcare    a system where doctors can prescribe solutions to improve health  not just manage disease. Same thing in the clinic waiting room. So every day in this country three million patients pass through about         clinic waiting rooms in this country. And what do they do when they're there  They sit  they watch the goldfish in the fish tank  they read extremely old copies of Good Housekeeping magazine. But mostly we all just sit there forever  waiting. How did we get here where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours to waiting  What if we had a waiting room where you don't just sit when you're sick  but where you go to get healthy. If airports can become shopping malls and McDonald's can become playgrounds  surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room. And that's what Health Leads has tried to do  to reclaim that real estate and that time and to use it as a gateway to connect patients to the resources they need to be healthy. So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast  your kid has asthma  your heat just got turned off  and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER  because the cold air triggered your child's asthma. But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously  the waiting room became the place where Health Leads turned your heat back on  And of course all of this requires a broader workforce. But if we're creative  we already have that too. We know that our doctors and nurses and even social workers aren't enough  that the ticking minutes of health care are too constraining. Health just takes more time. It requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many others. What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce were the    million college students in this country  Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities  unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients  and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using Google. Now lest you think it improbable that a college volunteer can make this kind of commitment  I have two words for you  March Madness. The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player dedicates    hours a week to his sport. Now we may think that's good or bad  but in either case it's real. And Health Leads is based on the presumption that for too long we have asked too little of our college students when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities. College sports teams say   We're going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning and we're going to measure your performance  and your team's performance  and if you don't measure up or you don't show up  we're going to cut you off the team. But we'll make huge investments in your training and development  and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers.  And people line up out the door just for the chance to be part of it. So our feeling is  if it's good enough for the rugby team  it's good enough for health and poverty. Health Leads too recruits competitively  trains intensively  coaches professionally  demands significant time  builds a cohesive team and measures results    a kind of Teach for America for healthcare. Now in the top    cities in the U.S. with the largest number of Medicaid patients  each of those has at least        college students. New York alone has half a million college students. And this isn't just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources  it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who've spent two  three  four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs. And they leave with the conviction  the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic aspirations for health care. And the thing is  there's thousands of these folks already out there. So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine at UCSF Medical Center  but for three years as an undergraduate she was a Health Leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center. Mia says   When my classmates write a prescription  they think their work is done. When I write a prescription  I think  can the family read the prescription  Do they have transportation to the pharmacy  Do they have food to take with the prescription  Do they have insurance to fill the prescription  Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads  not in medical school.  Now none of these solutions    the prescription pad  the electronic medical record  the waiting room  the army of college students    are perfect. But they are ours for the taking    simple examples of the vast under utilized healthcare resources that  if we reclaimed and redeployed  could realize our most basic aspiration of healthcare. So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind. And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell  my attorney  that I needed to leave. And I was so nervous  because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea. And I sat down with him and I said   Jeff  I have this idea that we could mobilize college students to address patients' most basic health needs.  And I'll be honest  all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me. But he said this   Rebecca  when you have a vision  you have an obligation to realize that vision. You must pursue that vision.  And I have to say  I was like  Whoa. That's a lot of pressure.  I just wanted a blessing  I didn't want some kind of mandate. But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision. I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country. I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare  it will not be by the diseases cured  but by the diseases prevented. It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists  but by how rarely we needed them. And most of all  I believe that when we measure healthcare  it will be  not by what the system was  but by what we chose it to be. Thank you. Thank you. Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form. From mother to daughter  preacher to congregant  teacher to pupil  storyteller to audience. Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet  human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable. We are inveterate storytellers. But where  in our increasingly secular and fragmented world  do we offer communality of experience  unmediated by our own furious consumerism  And what narrative  what history  what identity  what moral code are we imparting to our young  Cinema is arguably the   th century's most influential art form. Its artists told stories across national boundaries  in as many languages  genres and philosophies as one can imagine. Indeed  it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle. During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media  now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster. We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation  not story  is king. What was common to us all    years ago    the telling of stories between generations    is now rarified. As a filmmaker  it worried me. As a human being  it puts the fear of God in me. What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible  The irony is palpable  technical access has never been greater  cultural access never weaker. And so in      we set up FILMCLUB  an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions. If we could raid the annals of     years of film  maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young. Given the access to technology  even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board. In the first nine months we ran    clubs across the U.K.  with kids in age groups between five and    watching a film uninterrupted for    minutes. The films were curated and contextualized. But the choice was theirs  and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide. The outcome  immediate. It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind. In groups as large as     and as small as three  these young people discovered new places  new thoughts  new perspectives. By the time the pilot had finished  we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join. The film that changed my life is a      film by Vittorio De Sica   Miracle in Milan.  It's a remarkable comment on slums  poverty and aspiration. I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's   th birthday. Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema  find and pay for the print and the projectionist. But for my father  the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and    of their friends   In order   he said   to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation.  In the last shot of  Miracle in Milan   slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms. Sixty years after the film was made and    years after I first saw it  I see young faces tilt up in awe  their incredulity matching mine. And the speed with which they associate it with  Slumdog Millionaire  or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature. In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government  we screened  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Made in       the film is older than most of our members' grandparents. Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety. It shows how to do right  how to be heroically awkward. It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor. Shortly after  Mr. Smith  became a FILMCLUB classic  there was a week of all night filibustering in the House of Lords. And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle. After all  Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels. In choosing  Hotel Rwanda   they explored genocide of the most brutal kind. It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind. And when  Schindler's List  demanded that they never forget  one child  full of the pain of consciousness  remarked   We already forgot  otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen   As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.  Pickpocket  started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.  To Sir  with Love  ignited its teen audience. They celebrated a change in attitude towards non white Britons  but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity  unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage. By now  these thoughtful  opinionated  curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms    black and white  subtitled  documentary  non narrative  fantasy    and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose. Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week. From    clubs  we became hundreds  then thousands  until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in       clubs right across the country. And although the numbers were  and continue to be  extraordinary  what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life. Some of our kids started talking with their parents  others with their teachers  or with their friends. And those without friends started making them. The films provided communality across all manner of divide. And the stories they held provided a shared experience.  Persepolis  brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother  and  Jaws  became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother  the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey. Who was right  who wrong  What would they do under the same conditions  Was the tale told well  Was there a hidden message  How has the world changed  How could it be different  A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested. And they themselves had not known they cared. And as they wrote and debated  rather than seeing the films as artifacts  they began to see themselves. I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller. In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers. Quite recently she told me that in       two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents. When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions  it was these teenagers that fed the crew. I was past    when my father died. He never mentioned that journey. My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband  but with her three year old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt. After two years in hiding  my grandfather appeared in London. He was never right again. And his story was hushed as he assimilated. My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents. I had  Anne Frank    The Great Escape    Shoah    Triumph of the Will.  It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure. These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud  and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist. Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding  that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history  or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth. But within the reels lie purpose and meaning. As one    year old said after watching  Wizard of Oz    Every person should watch this  because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart.  We honor reading  why not honor watching with the same passion  Consider  Citizen Kane  as valuable as Jane Austen. Agree that  Boyz n the Hood   like Tennyson  offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together. Each a piece of memorable art  each a brick in the wall of who we are. And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's. And though not real  Eve Harrington  Howard Beale  Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human  and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England. We guessed that film  whose stories are a meeting place of drama  music  literature and human experience  would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB. What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior  confidence and academic achievement. Once reluctant students now race to school  talk to their teachers  fight  not on the playground  but to choose next week's film    young people who have found self definition  ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed. Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young. They are neither feral nor myopically self absorbed. They are  like other young people  negotiating a world with infinite choice  but little culture of how to find meaningful experience. We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes  yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered. If we want different values we have to tell a different story  a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity  that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity  and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group. Because when these people get home after a screening of  Rear Window  and raise their gaze to the building next door  they have the tools to wonder who  apart from them  is out there and what is their story. Thank you. When I was a child growing up in Maine  one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine  because my parents told me it would bring me luck. But you know  these shells  they're hard to find. They're covered in sand  they're difficult to see. However  over time  I got used to looking for them. I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. This grew into a passion for finding things  a love for the past and archaeology. And eventually  when I started studying Egyptology  I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. Because all of the sudden  in Egypt  my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long  next to the Nile. And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery. For trying to map the past  I knew that I had to see differently. So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared. This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. And the site visibly appears brown  but when we use the infrared and we process it  all of the sudden  using false color  the site appears as bright pink. What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians. What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city  called Itjtawy  missing for thousands of years. Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom  about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt  and the site is really important  because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art  architecture and religion. Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it  indicated within the red circles here  but somewhere within this massive flood plain. This area is huge    it's four miles by three miles in size. The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east  it covered over the city. So  how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape  Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack  blindfolded  wearing baseball mitts. So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape  very subtle changes. We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. But you can see in more detail  and even more interesting  this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists to do coring work  which you see here. When I say coring  it's like ice coring  but instead of layers of climate change  you're looking for layers of human occupation. And  five meters down  underneath a thick layer of mud  we found a dense layer of pottery. What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy  five meters down  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years  dating to the Middle Kingdom  dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. We also found work stone    carnelian  quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here. These might not look like much  but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom  these are the stones that were used. So  we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop  showing that whatever was there was a very important city. No Itjtawy was here yet  but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out. And even more importantly  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom    it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.  Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings. There's nothing like it in the land.  So as it turns out  TED was not founded in      AD. Making ideas actually started in      BC at a not lost for long city  found from above. It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I was about    years old I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation  looking for a movie to watch on HBO    and how many of you remember  Ferris Bueller's Day Off   Oh yeah  great movie  right     Well  I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen  and so I thought   Sweet  Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this   It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick  I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller  but that's how I remember you  you're Ferris. But you weren't doing Ferris y things at the time  you were doing gay things at the time. He was in a movie called  Torch Song Trilogy.  And  Torch Song Trilogy  was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love. Love and respect    that's what the whole film was about. And as I'm watching it  I'm realizing that they're talking about me. Not the drag queen part    I am not shaving my hair for anyone    but the gay part. The finding love and respect  the part about trying to find your place in the world. So as I'm watching this  I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears  and it stuck with me for the past    years. And there's this quote that the main character  Arnold  tells his mother as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.  There's one thing more    there's just one more thing you better understand. I've taught myself to sew  cook  fix plumbing  build furniture  I can even pat myself on the back when necessary  all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything. There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect  and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life.  I remember that scene like it was yesterday  I was     I was in tears  I was in the closet  and I'm looking at these two people  Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before  fighting for love. When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was  and was really quite happy  to tell you the truth  I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too. I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was    gay being happy  not gay being attracted to the same sex. In fact  I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle. Now  I'm sitting here trying to figure out  the gay lifestyle    the gay lifestyle   and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again  lifestyle  lifestyle  lifestyle. I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism. That's when I got scared. Because I'm thinking  if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization  I need to figure out what this stuff is  and I need to stop doing it right now. So  I took a look at my life  a hard look at my life  and I saw some things very disturbing. And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you  starting with my mornings. I drink coffee. Not only do I drink coffee  I know other gay people who drink coffee. I get stuck in traffic    evil  evil traffic. Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports. I look around  and I go   My God  look at all these gay people  We're all trapped in these lines  These long lines trying to get on an airplane  My God  this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil   I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room  his is messier. And because I have a    year old  all I do is cook and cook and cook. Any parents out there of teenagers  All we do is cook for these people    they eat two  three  four dinners a night    it's ridiculous  This is the gay lifestyle. And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic  my partner and I  we get together and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun. We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on  American Idol.  We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on. This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle. Run for your heterosexual lives  people. When my partner  Steve  and I first started dating  he told me this story about penguins. And I didn't know where he was going with it at first. He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me  but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with  they present them with a pebble    the perfect pebble. And then he reaches into his pocket  and he brings this out to me. And I looked at it  and I was like  this is really cool. And he says   I want to spend the rest of my life with you.  So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous  like  I don't know  a TEDx talk. I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time. And sometimes I just wear it just because. How many people out there are in love  Anyone in love out there  You might be gay. Because I  too  am in love  and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about. You may want to tell your spouse. Who  if they're in love  might be gay as well. How many of you are single  Any single people out there  You too might be gay  Because I know some gay people who are also single. It's really scary  this gay lifestyle thing  it's super duper evil and there's no end to it  It goes and goes and engulfs  It's really quite silly  isn't it  That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say that he supports    that he supports marriage equality. It's a wonderful day in our country's history  it's a wonderful day in the globe's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say  enough of this    first to himself  and then to the rest of the world. It's wonderful. But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago. And that is  apparently  this is just another move by the gay activists that's on the gay agenda. And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time. I've been to all of the functions  I've been to fundraisers  I've written about the topic  and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda. I've paid my dues on time  I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine  and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda. It's very  very frustrating  and I was feeling left out  like I wasn't quite gay enough. But then something wonderful happened  I was out shopping  as I tend to do  and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda. And I said to myself   LZ  for so long  you have been denied this. When you get in front of this crowd  you're gonna share the news. You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder  what exactly is in the gay agenda  What are these gays up to  What do they want   So  without further ado  I will present to you  ladies and gentlemen    now be careful  'cause it's evil    a copy  the official copy  of the gay agenda. The gay agenda  people  There it is  Did you soak it all in  The gay agenda. Some of you may be calling it  what  the Constitution of the United States  is that what you call it too  The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda. These gays  people like me  want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight. I was blown away when I saw it. I was like  wait  this is the gay agenda  Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about  I wouldn't have been so confused  I wouldn't have been so upset. But there it is. The gay agenda. Run for your heterosexual lives. Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed  because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people. Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  Not based upon the quality of your work  how long you've been there  if you stink  just if you're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered. All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda  also known as the U.S. Constitution. Specifically  this little amendment right here   No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.  I'm looking at you  North Carolina. But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution. This is the gay agenda  equality. Not special rights  but the rights that were already written by these people    these elitists  if you will. Educated  well dressed  some would dare say questionably dressed. Nonetheless  our forefathers  right  The people that  we say  knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution    the gay agenda  if you will. All of that flies in the face of what they did. That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda. Because I figured if I made it funny  you wouldn't be as threatened. I figured if I was a bit irreverent  you wouldn't find it serious. But when you see the map  and you see our state of Michigan    it's legal to fire someone for being gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay  lesbian  bisexual or transgendered  then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away  it's about granting them the rights that  have  already been stated. And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated  that we've already agreed upon. There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina  all those states that were clear  it's legal. If I could brag for a second  I have a    year old son from my marriage. He has a  . . He is starting a new club at school  Policy Debate. He's a budding track star  he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in. He volunteers. He prays before he eats. I would like to think  as his father    and he lives with me primarily    that I had a little something to do with all of that. I would like to think that he's a good boy  a respectful young man. I would like to think that I've proven to be a capable father. But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today  and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage  I would be disqualified for only one reason  because I'm gay. It doesn't matter what I've already proven  what I can do with my heart. It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption. And that's not just about me  that's about so many other Michiganders  U.S. citizens  who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are. This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history. There was a time in which  I don't know  people who were black couldn't have the same rights. People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights  couldn't vote. There was a point in our history in which  if you were considered disabled  that an employer could just fire you  before the Americans with Disabilities Act. We keep doing this over and over again. And so here we are        gay agenda  gay lifestyle  and I'm not a good dad and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are  not who they are. So when you hear the words  gay lifestyle  and  gay agenda  in the future  I encourage you to do two things  One  remember the U.S. Constitution  and then two  if you wouldn't mind looking to your left  please. Look to your right. That person next to you is a brother  is a sister. And they should be treated with love and respect. Thank you. So  that's what I've done with my life.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  As a kid  I grew up on a farm in Florida  and I did what most little kids do. I played a little baseball  did a few other things like that  but I always had the sense of being an outsider  and it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate  I thought   Wow  that's for me   you know  Because there was no coach standing directly over you  and these guys  they were just being themselves. There was no opponent directly across from you. And I loved that sense  so I started skating when I was about    years old  in       and when I did  I picked it up pretty quickly. In fact  here's some footage from about     . It wasn't until '   I won my first amateur championship  and then  by '    I was     and I won my first world championship  which was amazing to me  and in a very real sense  that was the first real victory I had. Oh  watch this. This is a casper slide  where the board's upside down. Mental note on that one.  Laughs  And this one here  An ollie. So  as she mentioned  that is overstated for sure  but that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating. Here's some images of that. Now  I was about halfway through my pro career in  I would say  the mid '  s. Freestyle itself  we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw  but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding  where guys were taking it to the streets  and they were using that ollie  like I showed you  They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff. So it was evolving upwards. In fact  when someone tells you they're a skater today  they pretty much mean a street skater  because freestyle  it took about five years for it to die  and at that stage  I'd been a  champion  champion for    years  which  phew  And suddenly it was over for me. That's it. It was gone. They took my pro model off the shelf  which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly. That's how you make your money  you know  You have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes. I had all that stuff  and it's gone. The crazy thing was  there was a really liberating sense about it  because I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.  Champion   again. Champion sounds so goofy  but it's what it was  right  And I got to    What drew me to skateboarding  the freedom was now restored  where I could just create things  because that's where the joy was for me  always  was creating new stuff. The other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks. Stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different. So  as humbling and rotten as it was   And believe me  it was rotten. I would go to skate spots  and I was already  like   famous guy   right  And everyone thought I was good. But in this new terrain  I was horrible. So people would go   Oh  he's all    Oh  what happened to Mullen    Laughter   Laughs  So  humbling as it was  I began again. Here are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.  Skateboard noises  And again  there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me   Oh  that one  That's  like  the hardest thing I've ever done. Okay  look at that. It's a darkslide. See how it's sliding on the backside  Those are super fun.  Laughter  And  actually  not that hard. You know  at the very root of that  see  caspers  see how you throw it   Skateboard noises  Simple as that  right  No biggie.  Laughter  And your front foot  the way it grabs it  is    I'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that  and I was like   How can I get it over   Because that had not yet been done. And then it dawned on me  and here's part of what I'm saying. I had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer  where it was like  oh my gosh  it's just your foot. It's just the way you throw your board over. Just let the ledge do that  and it's easy  and the next thing you know  there's    more tricks based out of the variations. So that's the kind of thing that  here  check this out  here's another way  and I won't overdo this. A little indulgent  I understand. There's something called a primo slide. It is the funnest trick ever to do. It's like skinboarding. And this one  look how it slides sideways  every which way  Okay  so when you're skating  and you take a fall  the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable. This  It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon  the falls  and that's what I love the most about it. It's so much fun to do. In fact  when I started doing them  I remember  because I got hurt. I had to get a knee surgery  right  So there were a couple of days where  actually a couple of weeks  where I couldn't skate at all. It would give out on me. And I would watch the guys  I'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating  my friends  and I was like   Man I gotta do something new. I want to do something new. I want to start fresh. I want to start fresh.  And so the night before my surgery  I'd watched  and I was like   How am I going to do this   So I ran up  and I jumped on my board  and I cavemanned  and I flipped it down  and I remember thinking  I landed so light footed  thinking  if my knee gives  they'll just have more work to do in the morning. And so  when it was the crazy thing. I don't know how many of you guys have had surgery  but     Laughter     you are so helpless  right  You're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by  every time it's always that  and right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep  all I was thinking is   Man  when I wake up and I get better  the first thing I'm going to do is film that trick.   Laughter  And indeed I did. It was the very first thing I filmed  which was awesome. Now  let me    I told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks. Consider that content  in a sense. What we do as street skaters is  you have these tricks. Say I'm working on darkslides  or a primo  that you guys know this stuff now.  Laughter   Laughs  What you do is you cruise around the same streets that you've seen a hundred times  but suddenly  because you already have something in this fixed domain of this target  it's like  what will match this trick  How can I expand  how can the context  how can the environment change the very nature of what I do  So you drive and drive and drive  and  actually I gotta admit  just because I was struggling with this because I'm here  but I'll just say it  is  I cannot tell you  not only to be here in front of you  but what a privilege it is to be at USC campus  because I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.  Laughter  So let me give you another example of how context shapes content. This is a place not that far from here. It's a rotten neighborhood. Your first consideration is  am I gonna get beat up  You go out and    See this wall  It's fairly mellow  and it's beckoning to do bank tricks  right  But there's this other aspect of it for wheelies  so check this out. There's a few tricks  again  how environment changes the nature of your tricks. Freestyle oriented  manual down    wheelie down. Watch  this one  Oh  I love this. It's like surfing  this one  the way you catch it. This one  a little sketchy going backwards  and watch the back foot  watch the back foot. Oop.  Laughs  Mental note right there. Again  we'll get back to that. Here. Back foot  back foot. Okay  up there  That was called a     flip. Notice how the board flipped and spun this way  both axes. And another example of how the context changed  and the creative process for me and for most skaters  is  you go  you get out of the car  you check for security  you check for stuff.  Laughter  It's funny  you get to know their rhythms  you know  the guys that cruise around  and skateboarding is such a humbling thing  man. No matter how good you are  right  you still gotta deal with   So you hit this wall  and when I hit it  the first thing you do is you fall forward  and I'm like  all right  all right. As you adjust  you punch it up  and then when I would do that  it was throwing my shoulder this way  which as I was doing it  I was like   Oh wow  that's begging for a     flip   because that's how you load up for a     flip. And so this is what I want to emphasize that  as you can imagine  all of these tricks are made of sub movements  executive motor functions  more granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you  but one thing I do know is  every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements. And so  as I'm going up  these things are floating around  and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind  like  rest back  pull it back a little bit  and let your intuition go as you feel these things. And these sub movements are just kind of floating around  and as the wall hits you  they connect themselves to an extent  and that's when the cognitive mind  you think   Oh      flip  I'm going to make that.  So that's how that works to me  the creative process  the process itself of street skating. So  next   Oh  mind you.  Laughs  Those are the community. These are some of the best skaters in the world. These are my friends. Oh my gosh  they're such good people. And the beauty of skateboarding is that  no one guy is the best. In fact  I know this is rotten to say  they're my friends  but a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board. What makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves. Every single one of these guys  you look at them  you can see a silhouette of them  and you realize  like   Oh  that's him  that's Haslam  that's Koston  there's these guys  these are the guys. And skaters  I think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of belonging  but belonging on their own terms  and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do  these basic tricks      flips  we take that  we make it our own  and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself. The greater the contribution  the more we express and form our individuality  which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with. The summation of that gives us something we could never achieve as an individual. I should say this. There's some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality  which we are expressing by what we do. Next. These guys. Very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation. Notice a couple of these shots from the Police Department. But it is quite similar. I mean  what is it to hack  right  It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do  right  And they're not all bad. You can be a Linux kernel hacker  make it more stable  right  More safe  more secure. You can be an iOS hacker  make your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to. Not authorized  but not illegal. And then you've got some of these guys  right  What they do is very similar to our creative process. They connect disparate information  and they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect. Right  It doesn't make them good people  but it's at the heart of engineering  at the heart of a creative community  an innovative community  and the open source community  the basic ethos of it is  take what other people do  make it better  give it back so we all rise further. Very similar communities  very similar. We have our edgier sides  too. It's funny  my dad was right. These are my peers. But I respect what they do  and they respect what I do  because they can do things. It's amazing what they can do. In fact  one of them  he was Ernst   Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County  so they're not  you never know who you're dealing with. We've all had some degree of fame. In fact  I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of. I've had a patent  and that was cool  and we started a company  and it grew  and it became the biggest  and then it went down  and then it became the biggest again  which is harder than the first time  and then we sold it  and then we sold it again. So I've had some success. And in the end  when you've had all of these things  what is it that continues to drive you  As I mentioned  the knee stuff and these things  what is it that will punch you  Because it's not just the mind. What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level  and when you've had it all  sometimes  guys  they die on the vine with all of that talent  and one of the things we've had  all of us  is fame  I think the best kind of fame  because you can take it off. I've been all around the world  and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name  and it's such a weird  visceral experience. It's like  it's disorienting. And you get in a car  and you drive away  and    minute drive  and you get out  and no one gives a rat's who you are.  Laughs  And it gives you that clarity of perspective of  man  I'm just me  and popularity  what does that really mean again  Not much. It's peer respect that drives us. That's the one thing that makes us do what we do. I've had over a dozen bones  these guys  this guy  over  what  eight     concussions  to the point where it's comedy  right  It is actually comedy. They mess with him. Next. And this is something deeper  and this is where I'm   I think I was on tour when I  I was reading one of the Feynman biographies. It was the red one or the blue one. And he made this statement that was so profound to me. It was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work  and it resonated because I had won    out of    contests that I'd entered over    years  and it made me bananas. In fact  winning isn't the word. I won it once. The rest of the time  you're just defending  and you get into this  like  turtle posture  you know  Where you're not doing. It usurped the joy of what I loved to do because I was no longer doing it to create and have fun  and when it died out from under me  that was one of the most liberating things because I could create. And look  I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy  right here. I'm not here to do that. It's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience. If you guys aren't already leaders in your community  you probably will be  and if there's anything I can give you that will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding  the only things of meaning  I think  and of permanence  it's not fame  it's not all these things. What it is is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it  and better than that  because  man  I'm    years old  or I'll be     and how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding  but there is   a community of your own making  and seeing it dispersed  and seeing younger  more talented  just different talent  take it to levels you can never imagine  because that lives on. So thank you for your time. Krisztina Holly  I have a question for you. So you've really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street  and  I think it was about four years ago you officially retired. Is that it  What's next  Rodney Mullen  That's a good question. KH  Something tells me it's not the end. RM  Yeah. I  every time you think you've chased something down  it's funny  no matter how good you are  and I know guys like this  it feels like you're polishing a turd. You know   Laughter  And I thought  the only way I can extend this is to change something infrastructural  and so that's what I proceeded to do  through a long story  one of desperation  so if I do it  rather than talk about it  if I do it  you'll be the first to know. KH  All right  we won't ask you any more. RM  You'll get a text. KH   Laughs  Right. Thank you. Good job.  Applause  RM  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Like most journalists  I'm an idealist. I love unearthing good stories  especially untold stories. I just didn't think that in       women would still be in that category. I'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium    JAWS. That's Sharky. I joined    years ago because I wanted female role models  and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media. We make up half the population of the world  but we're just    percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories. And we're just    percent of the experts quoted in stories. And now  with today's technology  it's possible to remove women from the picture completely. This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors  tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden. You can see Hillary Clinton on the right. Let's see how the photo ran in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn. Hillary's completely gone. The paper apologized  but said it never runs photos of women  they might be sexually provocative. This is an extreme case  yes. But the fact is  women are only    percent of the sources in stories on politics  and only    percent in stories on the economy. The news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories  except two  students and homemakers. So we all get a very distorted picture of reality. The problem is  of course  there aren't enough women in newsrooms. They report at just    percent of stories in print  TV and radio. Even in stories on gender based violence  men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime. Case in point  This March  the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley about a gang rape of a young girl     years old  in a small Texas town. McKinley writes that the community is wondering   How could their boys have been drawn into this    Drawn into this     like they were seduced into committing an act of violence. And the first person he quotes says   These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives.  You don't hear much about the    year old victim  except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup. The Times was deluged with criticism. Initially  it defended itself  and said   These aren't our views. This is what we found in our reporting.  Now  here's a secret you probably know already  Your stories are constructed. As reporters  we research  we interview. We try to give a good picture of reality. We also have our own unconscious biases. But The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way. I disagree with that. So three weeks later  The Times revisits the story. This time  it adds another byline to it with McKinley's  Erica Goode. What emerges is a truly sad  horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty. She was raped numerous times by many men. She had been a bright  easygoing girl. She was maturing quickly  physically  but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals. It's a very different picture. Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete. The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters. At KUNM here in Albuquerque  Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women. What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives. They tend to sensationalize  and they lack context. So for her graduate work  she did a three part series on the murder of    women  found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa. She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources  their own internal biases and cultural norms. And she worked with an editor at National Public Radio to try to get a story aired nationally. She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female. Stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men  and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts. Wired magazine  November     . Yes  the issue was about breast tissue engineering. Now I know you're all distracted  so I'll take that off. Eyes up here. So    Here's the thing  Wired almost never puts women on its cover. Oh  there have been some gimmicky ones    Pam from  The Office   manga girls  a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds. Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology  reading Wired. Chris Anderson  the editor of Wired  defended his choice and said there aren't enough women  prominent women in technology to sell a cover  to sell an issue. Part of that is true  there aren't as many prominent women in technology. Here's my problem with that argument  Media tells us every day what's important  by the stories they choose and where they place them  it's called agenda setting. How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google before their faces were on a magazine cover  Putting them there made them more recognizable. Now  Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea. This is its cover from November         . The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology. Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute   Silicon Valley is very white and very male. But that's not what Fast Company thinks the business world will look like in the future  so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving.  By the way  apparently  Wired took all this to heart. This was its issue in April. That's Limor Fried  the founder of Adafruit Industries  in the Rosie the Riveter pose. It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media. A recent global survey found that    percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men. But this is also about something far more complex  our own unconscious biases and blind spots. Shankar Vedantam is the author of  The Hidden Brain  How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents  Control Markets  Wage Wars  and Save Our Lives.  He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio  who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage  unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives. It's really difficult to disentangle those strands. But he did have one suggestion. He used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source. He balked at first  but said he eventually followed the directive happily  because his stories got better and his job got easier. Now  I don't know if one of the editors was a woman  but that can make the biggest difference. The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in      for a series it did on women around the world  but one of the reporters told me she's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor  and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground  particularly one on female genital mutilation    men would just not be allowed into those situations. This is an important point to consider  because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue  such as Afghanistan. What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is primary. Now  I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview. Not so sure about rural  traditional areas  where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men. It's important to keep talking about this  in light of Lara Logan. She was the CBS News correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square  right after this photo was taken. Almost immediately  pundits weighed in  blaming her and saying things like   You know  maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories.  I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew  who were attacked covering the same story. One way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them. One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company  but she never thought about this as a career path  until she met female role models at JAWS. But this is not just a job for super journalists or my organization. You all have a stake in a strong  vibrant media. Analyze your news. And speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage  like people at The New York Times did. Suggest female sources to reporters and editors. Remember    a complete picture of reality may depend upon it. And I'll leave you with a video clip that I first saw in        when I was a student in London. It's for The Guardian newspaper. It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist  but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world. Narrator  An event seen from one point of view gives one impression. Seen from another point of view  it gives quite a different impression. But it's only when you get the whole picture  you can fully understand what's going on.  The Guardian  Megan Kamerick  I think you'll all agree that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture. Two weeks ago  I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya  and we were talking about what I was going to talk about today. We have an    year old son  his name is Lincoln. He was sitting at the same table  doing his math homework. And during a pause in my conversation with Katya  I looked over at Lincoln and I was suddenly thunderstruck by a recollection of a client of mine. My client was a guy named Will. He was from North Texas. He never knew his father very well  because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him. And so  he was destined to be raised by a single mom  which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic  and when Will was five years old  she tried to kill him with a butcher knife. She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital  and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother  until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart. And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another  until  by the time he was nine years old  he was essentially living on his own. That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln  I looked at my son  and I realized that when my client  Will  was his age  he'd been living by himself for two years. Will eventually joined a gang and committed a number of very serious crimes  including  most seriously of all  a horrible  tragic murder. And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime. But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment. I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed  but what I would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before  in a way that is entirely noncontroversial. I think that's possible  because there is a corner of the death penalty debate    maybe the most important corner    where everybody agrees  where the most ardent death penalty supporters and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page. That's the corner I want to explore. Before I do that  though  I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds  and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last    years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way. You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters. The first chapter of every case is exactly the same  and it is tragic. It begins with the murder of an innocent human being  and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row  and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court. The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding known as a state habeas corpus appeal. The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding. And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen. The lawyers might file a clemency petition  they might initiate even more complex litigation  or they might not do anything at all. But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution. When I started representing death row inmates more than    years ago  people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story. They were on their own. In fact  it wasn't until the late     s that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story. So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers to handle their legal proceedings. The problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases. And so inevitably  lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four    that makes sense  of course. Those are the cases that are most urgent  those are the guys who are closest to being executed. Some of these lawyers were successful  they managed to get new trials for their clients. Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients  sometimes by years  sometimes by months. But the one thing that didn't happen was that there was never a serious and sustained decline in the number of annual executions in Texas. In fact  as you can see from this graph  from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient in the mid  to late     s  there have only been a couple of years where the number of annual executions dipped below   . In a typical year in Texas  we're averaging about two people a month. In some years in Texas  we've executed close to    people  and this number has never significantly declined over the last    years. And yet  at the same time that we continue to execute about the same number of people every year  the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis has dropped rather steeply. So we have this paradox  which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down. Why is that  It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate  because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply as the red line on that graph has gone down. What has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole  rather than sending them to the execution chamber. Why has that happened  It hasn't happened because of a dissolution of popular support for the death penalty. Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact that death penalty support in Texas is at an all time low. Do you know what all time low in Texas means  It means that it's in the low    percent. Now  that's really good compared to the mid     s  when it was in excess of    percent  but we can't explain the decline in death sentences and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole by an erosion of support for the death penalty  because people still support the death penalty. What's happened to cause this phenomenon  What's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters of the death penalty story. So    years ago  they focused on chapter four. And they went from chapter four    years ago to chapter three in the late     s. And they went from chapter three in the late     s to chapter two in the mid     s. And beginning in the mid  to late     s  they began to focus on chapter one of the story. Now  you might think that this decline in death sentences and the increase in the number of life sentences is a good thing or a bad thing. I don't want to have a conversation about that today. All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case  the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life. That's the first thing I've learned. Here's the second thing I learned  My client Will was not the exception to the rule  he was the rule. I sometimes say  if you tell me the name of a death row inmate    doesn't matter what state he's in  doesn't matter if I've ever met him before    I'll write his biography for you. And eight out of    times  the details of that biography will be more or less accurate. And the reason for that is that    percent of the people on death row are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did. Eighty percent of the people on death row are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system. That's the second lesson that I've learned. Now we're right on the cusp of that corner where everybody's going to agree. People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed  but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs. How do we do that  When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago  it was a big  gnarly problem. And he was learning how  when you have a big old gnarly problem  sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems. That's what we do for most problems    in math  in physics  even in social policy    we slice them into smaller  more manageable problems. But every once in a while  as Dwight Eisenhower said  the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger. The way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger. We have to say  all right. We have these four chapters of a death penalty story  but what happens before that story begins  How can we intervene in the life of a murderer before he's a murderer  What options do we have to nudge that person off of the path that is going to lead to a result that everybody    death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents    still think is a bad result  the murder of an innocent human being  You know  sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science. And by that  what they mean is rocket science is really complicated and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple. Well that's rocket science  that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket. What we're talking about today is just as complicated. What we're talking about today is also rocket science. My client Will and    percent of the people on death row had five chapters in their lives that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story. I think of these five chapters as points of intervention  places in their lives when our society could've intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all    death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents    say was a bad result. Now  during each of these five chapters  when his mother was pregnant with him  in his early childhood years  when he was in elementary school  when he was in middle school and then high school  and when he was in the juvenile justice system    during each of those five chapters  there were a wide variety of things that society could have done. In fact  if we just imagine that there are five different modes of intervention  the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters  and we could mix and match them any way we want  there are          more than          possible strategies that we could embrace in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on. So I'm not standing here today with the solution. But the fact that we still have a lot to learn  that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already. We know from experience in other states that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention that we could be using in Texas  and in every other state that isn't using them  in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad. I'll just mention a few. I won't talk today about reforming the legal system. That's probably a topic that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges. Instead  let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention that we can all help accomplish  because they are modes of intervention that will come about when legislators and policymakers  when taxpayers and citizens  agree that that's what we ought to be doing and that's how we ought to be spending our money. We could be providing early childhood care for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids  and we could be doing it for free. And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on. There are other states that do that  but we don't. We could be providing special schools  at both the high school level and the middle school level  but even in K    that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids  and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system. There are a handful of states that do that  Texas doesn't. There's one other thing we can be doing    well  there are a bunch of other things    there's one other thing that I'm going to mention  and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today. We could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes  and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them. If we're going to do that  we need a place to put them. Even if we do all of those things  some kids are going to fall through the cracks and they're going to end up in that last chapter before the murder story begins  they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system. And even if that happens  it's not yet too late. There's still time to nudge them  if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them. There are two professors in the Northeast    one at Yale and one at Maryland    they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison. And the kids are in prison  but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon. Now  it was logistically difficult. They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison  they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities  and most dauntingly of all  they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what  People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis. But they did all those things. Now  what do all of these things have in common  What all of these things have in common is that they cost money. Some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial. He used to say   Well  you can pay me now or you can pay me later.  What we're doing in the death penalty system is we're paying later. But the thing is that for every        dollars that we spend intervening in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters  we save        dollars in crime related costs down the road. Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it  it just makes economic sense. I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will. It was the day that he was going to be executed  and we were just talking. There was nothing left to do in his case. And we were talking about his life. And he was talking first about his dad  who he hardly knew  who had died  and then about his mom  who he did know  who was still alive. And I said to him   I know the story. I've read the records. I know that she tried to kill you.  I said   But I've always wondered whether you really actually remember that.  I said   I don't remember anything from when I was five years old. Maybe you just remember somebody telling you.  And he looked at me and he leaned forward  and he said   Professor      he'd known me for    years  he still called me Professor. He said   Professor  I don't mean any disrespect by this  but when your mama picks up a butcher knife that looks bigger than you are  and chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you  and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom and lean against the door and holler for help until the police get there   he looked at me and he said   that's something you don't forget.  I hope there's one thing you all won't forget  In between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch  there are going to be four homicides in the United States. We're going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes  and that's appropriate because we should punish people who do bad things. But three of those crimes are preventable. If we make the picture bigger and devote our attention to the earlier chapters  then we're never going to write the first sentence that begins the death penalty story. Thank you. Those of you who have seen the film  Moneyball   or have read the book by Michael Lewis  will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane. Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer  all the scouts told him so. They told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star. But what actually happened when he signed the contract    and by the way  he didn't want to sign that contract  he wanted to go to college    which is what my mother  who actually does love me  said that I should do too  and I did    well  he didn't do very well. He struggled mightily. He got traded a couple of times  he ended up in the Minors for most of his career  and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the Oakland A's. Now for many of you in this room  ending up in management  which is also what I've done  is seen as a success. I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs  going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure. And what I want to talk to you about today  and share with you  is that our healthcare system  our medical system  is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it    patients  others    as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane. And yet  every day thousands of people in this country are diagnosed with preconditions. We hear about pre hypertension  we hear about pre dementia  we hear about pre anxiety  and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with that in the green room. We also refer to subclinical conditions. There's subclinical atherosclerosis  subclinical hardening of the arteries  obviously linked to heart attacks  potentially. One of my favorites is called subclinical acne. If you look up subclinical acne  you may find a website  which I did  which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat. You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation. Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne. I have a name for all of these conditions  it's another precondition  I call them preposterous. In baseball  the game follows the pre game. Season follows the pre season. But with a lot of these conditions  that actually isn't the case  or at least it isn't the case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay  every single time in many cases. We have pre cancerous lesions  which often don't turn into cancer. And yet  if you take  for example  subclinical osteoporosis  a bone thinning disease  the precondition  otherwise known as osteopenia  you would have to treat     women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone. That's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who were diagnosed with this osteopenia. And so is it any wonder  given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions  that every year we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet         people a year    and that's a conservative estimate    are dying not because of the conditions they have  but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments  We've medicalized everything in this country. Women in the audience  I have some pretty bad news that you already know  and that's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized. Strike one is when you hit puberty. You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized. It's a condition  it has to be treated. Strike two is if you get pregnant. That's been medicalized as well. You have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy  otherwise something might go wrong. Strike three is menopause. We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized  because a study came out  a big one  NIH funded. It said  actually  a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good for many of those women. Just in case  I don't want to leave the men out    I am one  after all    I have really bad news for all of you in this room  and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere  You all have a universally fatal condition. So  just take a moment. It's called pre death. Every single one of you has it  because you have the risk factor for it  which is being alive. But I have some good news for you  because I'm a journalist  I like to end things in a happy way or a forward thinking way. And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk  which we'll see if that happens for everyone  you will be a pre vivor. I made up pre death. If I used someone else's pre death  I apologize  I think I made it up. I didn't make up pre vivor. Pre vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor  but hasn't actually had that cancer  to call themselves. You are a pre vivor. We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the audience  I'd like to suggest a reality TV show called  Pre vivor.  If you develop a disease  you're off the island. But the problem is  we have a system that is completely    basically promoted this. We've selected  at every point in this system  to do what we do  and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition  in some cases. Start with the doctor patient relationship. Doctors  most of them  are in a fee for service system. They are basically incentivized to do more    procedures  tests  prescribe medications. Patients come to them  they want to do something. We're Americans  we can't just stand there  we have to do something. And so they want a drug. They want a treatment. They want to be told  this is what you have and this is how you treat it. If the doctor doesn't give you that  you go somewhere else. That's not very good for doctors' business. Or even worse  if you are diagnosed with something eventually  and the doctor didn't order that test  you get sued. We have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications  expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment  because that obviously helps their bottom line. We have advocacy groups  like the one that's come up with pre vivor  who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk  or might have a condition  so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility  et cetera. But this isn't actually  despite what journalists typically do  this isn't actually about blaming particular players. We are all responsible. I'm responsible. I actually root for the Yankees  I mean talk about rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do. Thank you. But everyone is responsible. I went to medical school  and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically  or How Not to Order Tests. We have this system where that's what you do. And it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives. You know  economists like to say  there are no bad people  there are just bad incentives. And that's actually true. Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams  when it comes to medical technology. So when you put another MRI in every corner  you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery. Well  we've created a system where if you build it  they will come. But you can actually perversely tell people to come  convince them that they have to come. It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem  and how we all are part of this problem. I was medicalizing every risk factor  I was writing stories  commissioning stories  every day  that were trying to  not necessarily make people worried  although that was what often happened. But  you know  there are ways out. I saw my own internist last week  and he said to me   You know   and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free  but I paid him for the privilege  which is that I need to lose some weight. Well  he's right. I've had honest to goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now  same age my father got it  and it's a real disease. It's not pre hypertension  it's actual hypertension  high blood pressure. Well  he's right  but he didn't say to me  well  you have pre obesity or you have pre diabetes  or anything like that. He didn't say  better start taking this Statin  you need to lower your cholesterol. No  he said   Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit  or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing.  So that's  to me  a way forward. Billy Beane  by the way  learned the same thing. He learned  from watching this kid who he eventually hired  who was really successful for him  that it wasn't swinging for the fences  it wasn't swinging at every pitch like the sluggers do  which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to    they like to pick up those guys. This kid told him  you know  you gotta watch the guys  and you gotta go out and find the guys who like to walk  because getting on base by a walk is just as good  and in our healthcare system we need to figure out  is that really a good pitch or should we let it go by and not swing at everything  Thanks. As a magician  I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion. And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater  which was popular in the early part of the   th century. It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage. Now  I won't use mirrors  but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater. So let the story begin. On a dark and stormy night    really     it was the   th of July      . Lightning lit the sky  and a baby was born. His name was Nikola  Nikola Tesla. Now the baby grew into a very smart guy. Let me show you. Tesla  what is     multiplied by      Nikola Tesla  The result is        . Marco Tempest  Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way. When a word was mentioned  an image of it instantly appeared in his mind. Tree. Chair. Girl. They were hallucinations  which vanished the moment he touched them. Probably a form of synesthesia. But it was something he later turned to his advantage. Where other scientists would play in their laboratory  Tesla created his inventions in his mind. NT  To my delight  I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility. MT  And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination  he would build them in his workshop. NT  I needed no models  drawings or experiments. I could picture them as real in my mind  and there I run it  test it and improve it. Only then do I construct it. MT  His great idea was alternating current. But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe  To sell his idea  he became a showman. NT  We are at the dawn of a new age  the age of electricity. I have been able  through careful invention  to transmit  with the mere flick of a switch  electricity across the ether. It is the magic of science. Tesla has over     patents to his name  radio  wireless telegraphy  remote control  robotics. He even photographed the bones of the human body. But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream  harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls  and bringing light to the city. But Tesla's success didn't last. NT  I had bigger ideas. Illuminating the city was only the beginning. A world telegraphy center    imagine news  messages  sounds  images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly. MT  It's a great idea  it was a huge project. Expensive  too. NT  They wouldn't give me the money. MT  Well  maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets. NT  Yes  that was a big mistake. MT  Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered. He became a recluse. Dodged by death  he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria. NT  Everything I did  I did for mankind  for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich  where products of intellect  science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life. MT  Nikola Tesla died on the  th of January      . His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. His legacy is with us still. Tesla became the man who lit the world  but this was only the beginning. Tesla's insight was profound. NT  Tell me  what will man do when the forests disappear  and the coal deposits are exhausted  MT  Tesla thought he had the answer. We are still asking the question. Thank you. Everyone is both a learner and a teacher. This is me being inspired by my first tutor  my mom  and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to     students at Stanford University. Now the students and I enjoyed the class  but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern  the teaching technology isn't. In fact  I use basically the same technology as this   th century classroom. Note the textbook  the sage on the stage  and the sleeping guy in the back.  Laughter  Just like today. So my co teacher  Sebastian Thrun  and I thought  there must be a better way. We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class  but to bring it to anyone in the world for free. We announced the class on July   th  and within two weeks         people had signed up for it. And that grew to         students from     countries. We were thrilled to have that kind of audience  and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet.  Laughter  So we got to work. We studied what others had done  what we could copy and what we could change. Benjamin Bloom had showed that one on one tutoring works best  so that's what we tried to emulate  like with me and my mom  even though we knew it would be one on thousands. Here  an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper. A student said   This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who's explaining something you haven't grasped  but are about to.  And that's exactly what we were aiming for. Now  from Khan Academy  we saw that short    minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour long lecture and put it on the small format screen. We decided to go even shorter and more interactive. Our typical video is two minutes  sometimes shorter  never more than six  and then we pause for a quiz question  to make it feel like one on one tutoring. Here  I'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences  and here  there's a pause and the student has to reflect  understand what's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue. Students learn best when they're actively practicing. We wanted to engage them  to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves. We mostly avoid questions like   Here's a formula  now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two.  We preferred open ended questions. One student wrote   Now I'm seeing Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look.  And I like that kind of response. That's just what we were going for. We didn't want students to memorize the formulas  we wanted to change the way they looked at the world. And we succeeded. Or  I should say  the students succeeded. And it's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education  and in doing so  we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes. Most online classes  the videos are always available. You can watch them any time you want. But if you can do it any time  that means you can do it tomorrow  and if you can do it tomorrow  well  you may not ever get around to it.  Laughter  So we brought back the innovation of having due dates.  Laughter  You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week  but at the end of the week  you had to get the homework done. This motivated the students to keep going  and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time  so if you went into a discussion forum  you could get an answer from a peer within minutes. Now  I'll show you some of the forums  most of which were self organized by the students themselves. From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng  we learned the concept of  flipping  the classroom. Students watched the videos on their own  and then they come together to discuss them. From Eric Mazur  I learned about peer instruction  that peers can be the best teachers  because they're the ones that remember what it's like to not understand. Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that. Of course  we couldn't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students  so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums. And finally  from Teach For America  I learned that a class is not primarily about information. More important is motivation and determination. It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other. Now  the class ran    weeks  and in the end  about half of the         students watched at least one video each week  and over        finished all the homework  putting in    to     hours. They got this statement of accomplishment. So what have we learned  Well  we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together  but there are more ideas to try. Sebastian's teaching another class now. I'll do one in the fall. Stanford Coursera  Udacity  MITx and others have more classes coming. It's a really exciting time. But to me  the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering. We're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class  billions of interactions altogether  and now we can start analyzing that  and when we learn from that  do experimentations  that's when the real revolution will come. And you'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students. Good evening. We are in this wonderful open air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight  but when Qatar will host the football World Cup    years from now        we already heard it will be in the hot  very hot and sunny summer months of June and July. And when Qatar has been assigned to the World Cup all  many people around the world have been wondering  how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football  run around in this desert climate  How would it be possible that spectators sit  enjoy themselves in open air stadia in this hot environment  Together with the architects of Albert Speer   Partner  our engineers from Transsolar have been supporting  have been developing open air stadia based on     percent solar power  on     percent solar cooling. Let me tell you about that  but let me start with comfort. Let me start with the aspect of comfort  because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort. We are used to looking at charts like that  and you see this red line showing the air temperature in June and July  and yes  that's right  it's picking up to    degrees C. It's actually very hot. But air temperature is not the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort. Let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football  World Cups  Olympic Games around the world  looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities  and let me start with Mexico. Mexico temperature has been  air temperature has been something between     up to    degrees C  and people enjoyed themselves. It was a very comfortable game in Mexico City. Have a look. Orlando  same kind of stadium  open air stadium. People have been sitting in the strong sun  in the very high humidity in the afternoon  and they did not enjoy. It was not comfortable. The air temperature was not too high  but it was not comfortable during these games. What about Seoul  Seoul  because of broadcast rights  all the games have been in the late afternoon. Sun has already been set  so the games have been perceived as comfortable. What about Athens  Mediterranean climate  but in the sun it was not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort. And we know that from Spain  we know that  sol y sombra.  If you have a ticket  and you get a ticket for the shade  you pay more  because you're in a more comfortable environment. What about Beijing  It's again  sun in the day and high humidity  and it was not comfortable. So if I overlay  and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes  what we see is  in all these places  air temperature has been ranging something from    to     and if you go on the line      of    degrees C ambient temperatures. If you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort  all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort  ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable. So why is that  This is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort  which is the sun  the direct sun  the diffuse sun  which is wind  strong wind  mild wind  which is air humidity  which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in. And this is air temperature. All these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body  and scientists have developed a parameter  which is the perceived temperature  where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that I feel comfort or that I don't feel comfort. Which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature  And these parameters  these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism. Because of our metabolism  we as human beings  we produce heat. I'm excited  I'm talking to you  I'm probably producing     watts at the moment. You are sitting  you are relaxed  you're looking at me. It's probably     watts each person is producing  and we need to get rid of that energy. I need  with my body  to get rid of the energy  and the harder it is for myself  for my body  to get rid of the energy  the less comfort I feel. That's it. And if I don't get rid of the energy  I will die. If we overlay what happens during the football World Cup  what will happen in June  July  we will see  yes  air temperature will be much higher  but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon  it's probably the same comfort rating we've found in other places which has perceived as non comfortable. So we sat together with a team which prepared the Bid Book  or goal  that we said  let's aim for perceived temperature  for outdoor comfort in this range  which is perceived with a temperature of    degrees Celsius perceived temperature  which is extremely comfortable. People would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment. But what does it mean  If we just look on what happens  we see  temperature's too high. If we apply the best architectural design  climate engineering design  we won't get much better. So we need to do something active. We need  for instance  to bring in radiant cooling technology  and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning. And how does it look like in a stadium  So the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort. First of all  it's shading. It needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind. But that's not all what we need to do. We need to use active systems. Instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium  we can use radiant cooling technologies  like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor. And just by using cold water going through the water pipes  you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium  so you can create that comfort  and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air  the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs  to their individual energy balance. They can adjust and find their comfort they need to find. There are    stadia probably to come  but there are    training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train. We applied the same concept  shading of the training pitch  using a shelter against wind  then using the grass. Natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature  and using dehumidified air to create comfort. But even the best passive design wouldn't help. We need active system. And how do we do that  Our idea for the bid was     percent solar cooling  based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia  we cover the roofs of the stadia with PV systems. We don't borrow any energy from history. We are not using fossil energies. We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors. We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs  and also on the training pitches  which will be covered with large  flexible membranes  and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics  giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time. And this energy now is harvested throughout the year  sent into the grid  is replacing fossils in the grid  and when I need it for the cooling  I take it back from the grid and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the grid back when I need it for the solar cooling. And I can do that in the first year and I can balance that in the next     and the next    years  this energy  which is necessary to condition a World Cup in Qatar  the next    years  this energy goes into the grid of Qatar. So this     Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  This is not only useful for stadia. We can use that also in open air places and streets  and we've been working on the City of the Future in Masdar  which is in the United Emirates  Abu Dhabi. And I had the pleasure to work on the central plaza. And the same idea to use there  to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable. People enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall  which is chilled down and which is cooled. We wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon  even in these sunny and hot summer months  and they can enjoy and meet there with their families.  Applause  And the same concept  shade against the sun  shade against the wind  and use  use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint. And these beautiful umbrellas. So I'd like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort  to your thermal environment  tonight and tomorrow  and if you'd like to learn more about that  I invite you to go to our website. We uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort. And I also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters  it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions  to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment  and we can do that with the best passive design  but also using the energy source of the site in Qatar which is the sun. Thank you very much.  Applause  Shukran.  Applause  As a kid  I was fascinated with all things air and space. I would watch Nova on PBS. Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy. When I was in elementary school  my next door neighbor  he gave me a book for my birthday. It was an astronomy book  and I poured over that thing for hours on end  and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream  and part of that dream was  I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft. Well  a number of years later  I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA  working for the jet propulsion laboratory  and there our team was challenged to create a  D visualization of the solar system  and today I want to show you what we've done so far. Now  the kicker is  everything I'm about to do here you can do at home  because we built this for the public for you guys to use. So what you're looking at right now is the Earth. You can see the United States and California and San Diego  and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around. Now  this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before  but one thing we like to say in our group is  we do the opposite of Google Earth. Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard. We go from this view out to the stars. So the Earth is cool  but what we really want to show are the spacecraft  so I'm going to bring the interface back up  and now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters. We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites. If we did  it would be a complete mess  because there's a lot of stuff out there. And the cool thing is  we actually created  D models for a number of these spacecraft  so if you want to visit any of these  all you need to do is double click on them. So I'm going to find the International Space Station  double click  and it will take us all the way down to the ISS. And now you're riding along with the ISS where it is right now. And the other cool thing is  not only can we move the camera around  we can also control time  so I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward  and now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like  and they get one every    minutes.  Laughter  All right  so what about the rest of it  Well  I can click on this home button over here  and that will take us up to the inner solar system  and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system. You can see  there's Saturn  there's Jupiter  and while we're here  I want to point out something. It's actually pretty busy. Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars  just launched last weekend. Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter  there. We have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto. And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead  that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there. Well  a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration  and we have a lot of spacecraft out there. Granted  we're not sending humans up at the moment  well at least with our own launch vehicles  but NASA is far from dead  and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing. Anyway  while we're here  again  if you want to visit anything  all you need to do is double click. So I'm just going to double click on Vesta  and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta  and this is happening right now. I'm going to double click on Uranus  and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons. You can see how it's tilted at about    degrees. And just being able to visit different places and go through different times  we have data from      to     . Granted  we don't have everything in between  because some of the data is hard to get. Just being able to visit places in different times  you can explore this for hours  literally hours on end  but I want to show you one thing in particular  so I'm going to open up the destination tab  spacecraft outer planet missions  Voyager    and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby. So now we've gone back in time. We're now riding along with Voyager  . The date here is November         . Now  there's a funny thing going on here. It doesn't look like anything's going on. It looks like I've paused the program. It's actually running at real rate right now  one second per second  and in fact  Voyager   here is flying by Titan at I think it's        miles per hour. It only looks like nothing's moving because  well  Saturn here is         miles away  and Titan here is       to       miles away. It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening. But to make it more interesting  I'm going to speed up time  and we can watch as Voyager   flies by Titan  which is a hazy moon of Saturn. It actually has a very thick atmosphere. And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn  here. I'm going to pull out  and I want to show you Voyager   as it flies by Saturn. There's a point to be made here. With a  D visualization like this  we can not only just say Voyager   flew by Saturn. There's a whole story to tell here. And even better  because it's an interactive application  you can tell the story for yourself. If you want to pause it  you can pause it. If you want to keep going  if you want to change the camera angle  you can do that  and because of that  I can show you that Voyager   doesn't just fly by Saturn. It actually flies underneath Saturn. Now  what happens is  as it flies underneath Saturn  Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system  so if I just keep letting this go  you can see Voyager   fly up like that. And  in fact  I'm going to go back to the solar system. I'm going to go back to today  now  and I want to show you where Voyager   is. Right there  above  way above the solar system  way beyond our solar system. And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there. Now you know why  and to me  that's the point of this program. You can manipulate it yourself. You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself. You know  the theme today is  The World In Your Grasp.  Well  we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp    Laughter    and we hope once it's there  you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there  and what we're about to do. And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired  as I was as a kid  to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last two decades  India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services  as we call it  and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India  offshoring software development and back office services  there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India. When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China  it has  you know  led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. In fact  if you look at polls  they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. Now  the Western elites  however  have said this fear is misplaced. For example  if you have read   I suspect many of you have done so   read the book by Thomas Friedman called  The World Is Flat   he said  basically  in his book that  you know  this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes  it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. In fact  he says  it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world  with the more sophisticated  innovative tasks being done in the developed world  and the less sophisticated  shall we say  drudge work being done in the developing world. Now  what we were trying to understand was  is this true  Could India become a source  or a global hub  of innovation  just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development  And for the last four years  my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic. Initially  or  you know  as people would say  you know  in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model  say   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras  if the Indians are so bloody smart    Laughter  So initially  when we started our research  we went and met several executives  and we asked them   What do you think  Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation   They laughed. They dismissed us. They said   You know what  Indians don't do innovation.  The more polite ones said   Well  you know  Indians make good software programmers and accountants  but they can't do the creative stuff.  Sometimes  it took a more  took a veneer of sophistication  and people said   You know  it's nothing to do with Indians. It's really the rule based  regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity.  They said  instead  if you want to see real creativity  go to Silicon Valley  and look at companies like Google  Microsoft  Intel. So we started examining the R amp D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley. Well  interestingly  what you find there is  usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R amp D center as they may call it  and more often than not  it's an Indian.  Laughter  So I immediately said   Well  but you could not have been educated in India  right  You must have gotten your education here.  It turned out  in every single case  they came out of the Indian educational system. So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question  and the right question is  really  can Indians based out of India do innovative work  So off we went to India. We made  I think  about a dozen trips to Bangalore  Mumbai  Gurgaon  Delhi  Hyderabad  you name it  to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities. And what we found was  as we progressed in our research  was  that we were asking really the wrong question. When you ask   Where are the Indian Googles  iPods and Viagras   you are taking a particular perspective on innovation  which is innovation for end users  visible innovation. Instead  innovation  if you remember  some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter  he said   Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed.  It could be new products and services  but it could also be new ways of producing products. It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. Once you take this  there's no reason to restrict innovation  the beneficiaries of innovation  just to end users. When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation  what we found was  India is well represented in innovation  but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate  and what we did was we called it  invisible innovation.  And specifically  there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India. The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers  which is led by the multinational corporations  which have    in the last two decades  there have been     R amp D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than         professionals. Now  when you consider the fact that  historically  the R amp D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters  or in the country of origin of that multinational company  to have     R amp D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on  they said   We are working on global products.  They were not working on localizing global products for India  which is the usual role of a local R amp D. They were working on truly global products  and companies like Microsoft  Google  AstraZeneca  General Electric  Philips  have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R amp D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world. But of course  as an end user  you don't see that  because you only see the name of the company  not where it was developed. The other thing we were told then was   Yes  but  you know  the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R amp D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R amp D centers.  So my coauthor Phanish Puranam  who happens to be one of the smartest people I know  said he's going to do a study. What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R amp D center in USA and in India  and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India  so he's now comparing the patents of R amp D centers in the U.S. with R amp D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers  Interestingly  what he finds is   and by the way  the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations  How many times does a future patent reference the older patent    he finds something very interesting. What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R amp D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. So within the company  there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies  where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world. For example  in the pharma industry  a lot of the molecules are being developed  but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. For example  XCL Technologies  they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing     Dreamliner  one to avoid collisions in the sky  and another to allow landing in zero visibility. But of course  when you climb onto the Boeing      you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India. The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations  because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. Process innovation is different from product innovation. It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product  but not a new product itself  Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. What happens   You know  it's a dead end job in the West  what high school dropouts do. What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart  young  ambitious kids on a call center job  Very quickly  they get bored  and they start innovating  and they start telling the boss how to do this job better  and out of this process innovation comes product innovations  which are then marketed around the world. For example       Customer  traditional call center company  used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone  you can guess or predict what this phone call is about. It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West. And the last kind of innovation  invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation. It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work  and the most significant management innovation to come out of India  invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model. What the global delivery model allows is  it allows you to take previously geographically core located tasks  break them up into parts  send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists  and then specify the means for reintegrating them. Without that  you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. So  what I'm trying to say is  what we are finding in our research is  that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg  India is well represented in the invisible  large  submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. Now  this has  of course  some implications  and so we developed three implications of this research. The first is what we called sinking skill ladder  and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you  which was about the flight of jobs. Now  of course  when we first  as a multinational company  decide to outsource jobs to India in the R amp D  what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India  the least sophisticated jobs  just like Tom Friedman would predict. Now  what happens is  when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R amp D work  at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem  which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company  So you have two choices then  Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder   immigration   or you say  there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India  why don't we move the next step to India  What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder  you    it's a self perpetuating act  because of the sinking skill ladder  and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once. You can't be a professor without having been a student. You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. So  if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs  at some stage  the next step of the ladder has to follow. The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT  the top management teams. If the R amp D talent is going to be based out of India and China  and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China  you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China  because that's where the product leadership is  that's where the important market leadership is. Right  And the last thing we point out in this slide  which is  you know  that to this story  there's one caveat. India has the youngest growing population in the world. This demographic dividend is incredible  but paradoxically  there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. Indian institutes and educational system  with a few exceptions  are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going  so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this  but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure. So finally  I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company  IBM. As many of you know  IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. In fact  if you look at the number of patents filed over history  I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company. Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. In       they had         employees  or         employees  out of which          were in America        were in India. In       they had         employees  by which time the U.S. employees had moved to          whereas the Indian employees had gone to        . Well  in       they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore  so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. Here are my best guesses. Okay  I'm not saying this is the exact number  it's my best guess. It gives you a sense of the trend. There are         people now at IBM  out of which        are remaining in the U.S.  and         are in India. So you tell me  is IBM an American company  or an Indian company   Laughter  Ladies and gentlemen  thank you very much.  Applause  What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes  and this is from a book I'm preparing called  Letters to a Young Scientist.  I'd thought it'd be appropriate to present it  on the basis that I have had extensive experience in teaching  counseling scientists across a broad array of fields. And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing that teaching and counseling. So let me begin by urging you  particularly you on the youngsters' side  on this path you've chosen  to go as far as you can. The world needs you  badly. Humanity is now fully into the techno scientific age. There is going to be no turning back. Although varying among disciplines    say  astrophysics  molecular genetics  the immunology  the microbiology  the public health  to the new area of the human body as a symbiont  to public health  environmental science. Knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every    to    years. Technology is increasing at a comparable rate. Between them  the two already pervade  as most of you here seated realize  every dimension of human life. So swift is the velocity of the techno scientific revolution  so startling in its countless twists and turns  that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment. There will come a time  of course  when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge  which actually began in the     s  has to peak and level off  but that's not going to matter to you. The revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades. It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today. Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing  inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines. In time  all of science will come to be a continuum of description  an explanation of networks  of principles and laws. That's why you need not just be training in one specialty  but also acquire breadth in other fields  related to and even distant from your own initial choice. Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning. The search for knowledge is in our genes. It was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world  and it's never going to be quenched. To understand and use it sanely  as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you. In education  medicine  law  diplomacy  government  business and the media that exist today. Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy  which most badly lack today    no applause  please. It will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job. Therefore you will do well to act on the side  no matter how far into the laboratory you may go  to serve as teachers during the span of your career. I'll now proceed quickly  and before else  to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career. If you are a bit short in mathematical skills  don't worry. Many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi literate. A metaphor will serve here  Where elite mathematicians and statisticians and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm of science  the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists  including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank  are the ones who map the terrain  they scout the frontiers  they cut the pathways  they raise the buildings along the way. Some may have considered me foolhardy  but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists. During    years of teaching biology at Harvard  I watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure. These math phobes deprive science and medicine of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent. Here's how to relax your anxieties  if you have them  Understand that mathematics is a language ruled like other verbal languages  or like verbal language generally  by its own grammar and system of logic. Any person with average quantitative intelligence who learns to read and write mathematics at an elementary level will  as in verbal language  have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science. The longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language of mathematics will be to master  just as again in any verbal language  but it can be done at any age. I speak as an authority on that subject  because I'm an extreme case. I didn't take algebra until my freshman year at the University of Alabama. They didn't teach it before then. I finally got around to calculus as a    year old tenured professor at Harvard  where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students  little more than half my age. A couple of them were students in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology. I swallowed my pride  and I learned calculus. I found out that in science and all its applications  what is crucial is not that technical ability  but it is imagination in all of its applications. The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition. I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations. They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work  during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant. Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake. Of foremost importance is a thorough  well organized knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter. When something new is discovered  it's logical then that one of the follow up steps is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward. If that step proves too difficult for the person or team that made the discovery  a mathematician can then be added by them as a collaborator. Consider the following principle  which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One  It is far easier for scientists including medical researchers  to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations. It is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply  and focus on that. Keep in mind  then  Wilson's Second Principle  For every scientist  whether researcher  technician  teacher  manager or businessman  working at any level of mathematical competence  there exists a discipline in science or medicine for which that level is enough to achieve excellence. Now I'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career  or if you're teaching  how you might enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists. In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research  or to develop world class expertise  take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited. Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand. This is not to de emphasize the essential requirement of broad training  or the value of apprenticing yourself in ongoing research to programs of high quality. It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful programs  and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support. But through it all  look for a way to break out  to find a field and subject not yet popular. We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine. There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur  as measured in discoveries per investigator per year. You may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies  March to the sound of the guns. In science  the exact opposite is the case  March away from the sound of the guns. So Wilson's Principle Number Three  March away from the sound of the guns. Observe from a distance  but do not join the fray. Make a fray of your own. Once you have settled on a specialty  and the profession you can love  and you've secured opportunity  your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert. There are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine. And on then into the social sciences  where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority. When the subject is still very thinly populated  you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority. The world needs this kind of expertise  and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it. The existing information and what you self discover may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge. Well  if that's the case  good. Why hard instead of easy  The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four. In the attempt to make scientific discoveries  every problem is an opportunity  and the more difficult the problem  the greater will be the importance of its solution. Now this brings me to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made. Scientists  pure mathematicians among them  follow one or the other of two pathways  First through early discoveries  a problem is identified and a solution is sought. The problem may be relatively small  for example  where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread  Or larger  what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe  As the answer is sought  other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked. This first of the two strategies is like a hunter  exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry  who finds other quarries along the way. The second strategy of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter in what we call  the naturalist's trance   the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting  any quarry worth taking. The search is not for the solution of the problem  but for problems themselves worth solving. The two strategies of research  original research  can be stated as follows  in the final principle I'm going to offer you  For every problem in a given discipline of science  there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution. And conversely  for every species or other entity or phenomenon  there exist important problems for the solution of which  those particular objects of research are ideally suited. Find out what they are. You'll find your own way to discover  to learn  to teach. The decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention  general health  the quality of life. All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master. You have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction  at its conclusion  of a life well lived. And I thank you for having me here tonight. Oh  thank you. Thank you very much. I salute you. So  last month  the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after     years  which made me nostalgic  because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid  maybe    years old. And I wondered if I could update that game  not just for modern methods  but for the modern me. So I tried. I went to an online encyclopedia  Wikipedia  and I entered the term  Earth.  You can start anywhere  this time I chose Earth. And the first rule of the game is pretty simple. You just have to read the article until you find something you don't know  and preferably something your dad doesn't even know. And in this case  I quickly found this  The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest  like I might have thought  it's the tip of this mountain  Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The Earth spins  of course  as it travels around the sun  so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle  like some Earthlings. And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes  it's one degree away from the equator  it's riding that bulge  and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth. And it is really fun to say. So I immediately decided  this is going to be the name of the game  or my new exclamation. You can use it at TED. Chimborazo  right  It's like  eureka  and  bingo  had a baby. I didn't know that  that's pretty cool. Chimborazo  So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple. You just have to find another term and look that up. Now in the old days  that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically  maybe getting sidetracked  that was fun. Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from. I can go literally anywhere in the world  I think since I was already in Ecuador  I just decided to click on the word  tropical.  That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth. Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south  that much I knew  but I was surprised to learn this little fact  Those are not cartographers' lines  like latitude or the borders between nations  they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt  and they change. They move  they go up  they go down. In fact  for years  the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about    meters per year  and nobody told me that. I didn't know it. Chimborazo  So to keep the game going  I just have to find another term and look that one up. Since I'm already in the tropics  I chose  Tropical rainforest.  Famous for its diversity  human diversity. There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet. They're all over the globe  but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests. This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get  friended.  The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end. It mentioned leopards and ring tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera  which turn out to be beetles. Now I clicked on this on purpose  but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake  it does remind me  for the band  see  The Beatles   for the car see  Volkswagon Beetle   but I am here for beetle beetles. This is the most successful order on the planet by far. Something between    and    percent of all life forms on the planet  including plants  are beetles. That means the next time you are in the grocery store  take a look at the four people ahead of you in line. Statistically  one of you is a beetle. And if it is you  you are astonishingly well adapted. There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums. There are predator beetles  that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us. There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings. This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri  who renews the ball of the sun every morning  which is how that dung rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Beetles  I was reminded  have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom. Fireflies are not flies  fireflies are beetles. Fireflies are coleoptera  and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well. Like my next link  The chemical language of pheromones. Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex. Yeah. And the link to aphrodisiac. Now that's something that increases sexual desire  possibly chocolate. There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac. But as the article mentions  because of enzyme breakdown  it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally. So those of you who only eat your chocolate  you might have to experiment. The link I clicked on here   sympathetic magic   mostly because I understand what both of those words mean. But not when they're together like that. I do like sympathy. I do like magic. So when I click on  sympathetic magic   I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls. This is the boy in me getting lucky again. Sympathetic magic is imitation. If you imitate something  maybe you can have an effect on it. That's the idea behind voodoo dolls  and possibly also cave paintings. The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind. I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves. We've got tens of thousands years old artwork. Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands  usually the left hand. We have been a dominantly right handed tribe for millenia  so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube  I can easily picture how he did it. And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for  hand   go to the page for  hand   where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I've found in a long time. It's simply this  The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar. Now that's embarrassing  because up until now  every time I've said   I know it like the back of my hand   I've really been saying   I'm totally familiar with that  I just don't know it's freaking name  right   And the link I clicked on here  well  lemurs  monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar. I click on chimpanzee  and I get our closest genetic relative. Pan troglodytes  the name we give him  means  cave dweller.  He doesn't. He lives in rainforests and savannas. It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us  evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us  and in some cases  he gets places before us. Like my next link  the almost irresistible link  Ham the Astrochimp. I click on him  and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice  in fact. He's born in Cameroon  which is smack in the middle of my tropics map  and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles. In between those two landmarks in Ham's life  he flew into space. He experienced weightlessness and re entry months before the first human being to do it  Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page  I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature  huge in heroism. Top estimates  Soviet estimates  put this guy at  .   meters  that is less than five and a half feet tall max  possibly because he was malnourished as a child. Germans occupied Russia. A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household  and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut. Years later  the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space  the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet. And he didn't just leave it  he circled it once. Fifty years later  as a tribute  the International Space Station  which is still up there tonight  synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit  at the exact same time of day  and filmed it  so you can go online and you can watch over     minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride  possibly a lonely one  the first person to ever see such a thing. And then when you've had your fill of that  you can click on one more link. You can come back to Earth. You return to where you started. You can finish your game. You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know. And for me  I quickly landed on this one  The Earth has a tolerance of about .   percent from the reference spheroid  which is less than the .   percent allowed in billiard balls. This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy. I found it myself. It's got some math that I can do. I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it. What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball  if you could take planet Earth  with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests  astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees  voodoo dolls  fireflies  chocolate  sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea  you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball  it would be as smooth as a billiard ball  presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle. That's pretty cool. I didn't know that. Chimborazo  Thank you. So a few weeks ago  a friend of mine gave this toy car to his   year old son. But instead of going into a store and buying one  like we do normally  he went to this website and he downloaded a file  and then he printed it on this printer. So this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that The Economist magazine defined as the Third Industrial Revolution. Actually  I argue that there is another revolution going on  and it's the one that has to do with open source hardware and the maker's movement  because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually open source. So you go to the same website  you can download all the files that you need in order to make that printer  the construction files  the hardware  the software  all the instruction is there. And also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers  and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open source. You don't need anybody's permission to create something great. And that space is like the personal computer in       like the Apples with the other companies are fighting  and we will see in a few years  there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out. Well  there's also another interesting thing. I said the electronics are open source  because at the heart of this printer there is something I'm really attached to  these Arduino boards  the motherboard that sort of powers this printer  is a project I've been working on for the past seven years. It's an open source project. I worked with these friends of mine that I have here. So the five of us  two Americans  two Italians and a Spaniard  we    Laughter  You know  it's a worldwide project.  Laughter  So we came together in this design institute called the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea  which was teaching interaction design  this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things. Well  when you design an object that's supposed to interact with a human being  if you make a foam model of a mobile phone  it doesn't make any sense. You have to have something that actually interacts with people. So  we worked on Arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use  so that our students could just build things that worked  but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month. So how do I make something that even a kid can use  And actually  with Arduino  we have kids like Sylvia that you see here  that actually make projects with Arduino. I have    year old kids stop me and show me stuff they built for Arduino that's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them the tools. So let's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly  so one of the examples that I like to sort of kick off this discussion is this example of this cat feeder. The gentleman who made this project had two cats. One was sick and the other one was healthy  so he had to make sure they ate the proper food. So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat  and opens the door and the cat can eat the food. This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer  some cardboard  tape  couple of sensors  a few blinking LEDs  and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market. And I like this phrase   Scratch your own itch.  If you have an idea  you just go and you make it. This is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics. So one of the features that I think is important about our work is that our hardware  on top of being made with love in Italy   as you can see from the back of the circuit    Laughter  is that it's open  so we publish all the design files for the circuit online  so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something  or to modify  to learn. You know  when I was learning about programming  I learned by looking at other people's code  or looking at other people's circuits in magazines. And this is a good way to learn  by looking at other people's work. So the different elements of the project are all open  so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license. So  you know  I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon  like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons. Or  the software is GPL  so it's open source as well. The documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the Creative Commons. Just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is Arduino and what isn't. Now  Arduino itself is made of a lot of different open source components that maybe individually are hard to use for a    year old kid  so Arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies where we try to give them the best user experience to get something done quickly. So you have situations like this  where some people in Chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them  to organize a workshop and to save money. Or there are companies that make their own variations of Arduino that fit in a certain market  and there's probably  maybe like a     of them or something at the moment. This one is made by a company called Adafruit  which is run by this woman called Limor Fried  also known as Ladyada  who is one of the heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement. So  this idea that you have a new  sort of turbo charged DIY community that believes in open source  in collaboration  collaborates online  collaborates in different spaces. There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community  and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language  beautifully typeset. Or you have websites  like this one  like Instructables  where people actually teach each other about anything. So this one is about Arduino projects  the page you see on the screen  but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else. So let's look at some projects. So this one is a quadcopter. It's a small model helicopter. In a way  it's a toy  no  And so this one was military technology a few years ago  and now it's open source  easy to use  you can buy it online. DIY Drones is the community  they do this thing called ArduCopter. But then somebody actually launched this start up called Matternet  where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in Africa  and the fact that this was easy to find  open source  easy to hack  enabled them to prototype their company really quickly. Or  other projects. Matt Richardson  I'm getting a little sick of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over again  so I decided to do something about it. This Arduino project  which I call the Enough Already  will mute the TV anytime any of these over exposed personalities is mentioned.  Laughter  I'll show you how I made it.  Applause  MB  Check this out. MR  Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her   MB  Eh   Laughter  MR  It should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of Kim Kardashian's wedding. MB  Okay. So  you know  again  what is interesting here is that Matt found this module that lets Arduino process TV signals  he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV  put it together and then created this great project. It's also used  Arduino's used  in serious places like  you know  the Large Hadron Collider. There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of measuring some parameters. Or it's used for   So this is a musical interface built by a student from Italy  and he's now turning this into a product. Because it was a student project becoming a product. Or it can be used to make an assistive device. This is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you're signing on a display And again  this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell Arduino compatible parts  and you assemble it into a project. Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU  where they met with this boy who has a severe disability  cannot play with the PS   so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability. Or you can find it in arts projects. So this is the txtBomber. So you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall  and it basically has all these solenoids pressing the buttons on spray cans  so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages. So  yeah.  Applause  Then we have this plant here. This is called Botanicalls  because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi Fi module in the plant  and it's measuring the well being of the plant  and it's creating a Twitter account where you can actually interact with the plant.  Laughter  So  you know  this plant will start to say   This is really hot   or there's a lot of  you know   I need water right now.   Laughter  So it just gives a personality to your plant. Or this is something that twitters when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks.  Laughter  Or this is a    year old kid in Chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter. He has         followers. He's    and he anticipated a governmental project by one year.  Applause  Or again  another project where  by analyzing the Twitter feed of a family  you can basically point where they are  like in the  Harry Potter  movie. So you can find out everything about this project on the website. Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts.  Laughter  It's interesting how  in       Gizmodo basically defined  said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter  so it was   a lot changed in between.  Laughter  So very serious project. When the Fukushima disaster happened  a bunch of people in Japan  they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn't really open and really reliable  so they built this Geiger counter  plus Arduino  plus network interface. They made     of them and gave them to people around Japan  and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called Cosm  another website they built  so you can actually get reliable real time information from the field  and you can get unbiased information. Or this machine here  it's from the DIY bio movement  and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA  and again  it's completely open source from the ground up. Or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make. Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using Arduino and a few parts. This is a pH probe. Or you get kids  like these kids  they're from Spain. They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably  like      and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino based robot. And so when we had to make our own educational robot  we just went to them and said  you know   You design it  because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids.  Not me. I'm an old guy. What am I supposed to excite  huh   Laughter  But as I   in terms of educational assets.  Laughter  There's also companies like Google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones  tablets and the real world. So the Accessory Development Kit from Google is open source and based on Arduino  as opposed to the one from Apple which is closed source  NDA  sign your life to Apple. Here you are. There's a giant maze  and Joey's sitting there  and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet. Also  I come from Italy  and the design is important in Italy  and yet very conservative. So we worked with a design studio called Habits  in Milan  to make this mirror  which is completely open source. This doubles also as an iPod speaker. So the idea is that the hardware  the software  the design of the object  the fabrication  everything about this project is open source and you can make it yourself. So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great devices  to learn how to make interactive products by starting from something real. But when you have this idea  you know  what happens to all these ideas  There's  like  thousands of ideas that I   You know  it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations. I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you. But let's start from this example  So  the group of people that started this company called Pebble  they prototyped a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone  and you can display information on it. And they prototyped with an old LCD screen from a Nokia mobile phone and an Arduino. And then  when they had a final project  they actually went to Kickstarter and they were asking for         dollars to make a few of them to sell. They got    million dollars. They got a completely fully funded start up  and they don't have to  you know  get VCs involved or anything  just excite the people with their great project. The last project I want to show you is this  It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter  so if you want to contribute  please do it. It's a satellite that goes into space  which is probably the least open source thing you can imagine  and it contains an Arduino connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino  you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite and run them. So imagine  if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite space experiments like that. So  as I said  there's lots of examples  and I'm going to stop here. And I just want to thank the Arduino community for being the best  and just every day making lots of projects. Thank you.  Applause  And thanks to the community. Chris Anderson  Massimo  you told me earlier today that you had no idea  of course  that it would take off like this. MB  No. CA  I mean  how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you've unlocked  MB  Well  it's the work of a lot of people  so we as a community are enabling people to make great stuff  and I just feel overwhelmed. It's just  it's difficult to describe this. Every morning  I wake up and I look at all the stuff that Google Alerts sends me  and it's just amazing. It's just going into every field that you can imagine. CA  Thank you so much.  Applause  Openness. It's a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities. Open ended  open hearth  open source  open door policy  open bar.  Laughter  And everywhere the world is opening up  and it's a good thing. Why is this happening  The technology revolution is opening the world. Yesterday's Internet was a platform for the presentation of content. The Internet of today is a platform for computation. The Internet is becoming a giant global computer  and every time you go on it  you upload a video  you do a Google search  you remix something  you're programming this big global computer that we all share. Humanity is building a machine  and this enables us to collaborate in new ways. Collaboration can occur on an astronomical basis. Now a new generation is opening up the world as well. I started studying kids about    years ago     so actually    years ago now    and I noticed how my own children were effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology  and at first I thought   My children are prodigies    Laughter  But then I noticed all their friends were like them  so that was a bad theory. So I've started working with a few hundred kids  and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age  to be bathed in bits. I call them the Net Generation. I said  these kids are different. They have no fear of technology  because it's not there. It's like the air. It's sort of like  I have no fear of a refrigerator. And    Laughter  And there's no more powerful force to change every institution than the first generation of digital natives. I'm a digital immigrant. I had to learn the language. The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well. Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age  everything from old models of the corporation  government  media  Wall Street  are in various stages of being stalled or frozen or in atrophy or even failing  and this is now creating a burning platform in the world. I mean  think about Wall Street. The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down global capitalism. Now  you know the idea of a burning platform  that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different  perhaps something radically different. And we need to change and open up all of our institutions. So this technology push  a demographic kick from a new generation and a demand pull from a new economic global environment is causing the world to open up. Now  I think  in fact  we're at a turning point in human history  where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the Industrial Age around a new set of principles. Now  what is openness  Well  as it turns out  openness has a number of different meanings  and for each there's a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization. The first is collaboration. Now  this is openness in the sense of the boundaries of organizations becoming more porous and fluid and open. The guy in the picture here  I'll tell you his story. His name is Rob McEwen. I'd like to say   I have this think tank  we scour the world for amazing case studies.  The reason I know this story is because he's my neighbor.  Laughter  He actually moved across the street from us  and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors  and he says   You're Don Tapscott. I've read some of your books.  I said   Great. What do you do   And he says   Well I used to be a banker and now I'm a gold miner.  And he tells me this amazing story. He takes over this gold mine  and his geologists can't tell him where the gold is. He gives them more money for geological data  they come back  they can't tell him where to go into production. After a few years  he's so frustrated he's ready to give up  but he has an epiphany one day. He wonders   If my geologists don't know where the gold is  maybe somebody else does.  So he does a  radical  thing. He takes his geological data  he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet called the Goldcorp Challenge. It's basically half a million dollars in prize money for anybody who can tell me  do I have any gold  and if so  where is it   Laughter  He gets submissions from all around the world. They use techniques that he's never heard of  and for his half a million dollars in prize money  Rob McEwen finds  .  billion dollars worth of gold. The market value of his company goes from    million to    billion dollars  and I can tell you  because he's my neighbor  he's a happy camper.  Laughter  You know  conventional wisdom says talent is inside  right  Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night. He viewed talent differently. He wondered  who are their peers  He should have fired his geology department  but he didn't. You know  some of the best submissions didn't come from geologists. They came from computer scientists  engineers. The winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is. He helped us understand that social media's becoming social production. It's not about hooking up online. This is a new means of production in the making. And this Ideagora that he created  an open market  agora  for uniquely qualified minds  was part of a change  a profound change in the deep structure and architecture of our organizations  and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate  to create goods and services  to engage with the rest of the world  in terms of government  how we create public value. Openness is about collaboration. Now secondly  openness is about transparency. This is different. Here  we're talking about the communication of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations  employees  customers  business partners  shareholders  and so on. And everywhere  our institutions are becoming naked. People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks  but that's just the tip of the iceberg. You see  people at their fingertips now  everybody  not just Julian Assange  have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on  scrutinizing  informing others  and even organizing collective responses. Institutions are becoming naked  and if you're going to be naked  well  there's some corollaries that flow from that. I mean  one is  fitness is no longer optional.  Laughter  You know  Or if you're going to be naked  you'd better get buff. Now  by buff I mean  you need to have good value  because value is evidenced like never before. You say you have good products. They'd better be good. But you also need to have values. You need to have integrity as part of your bones and your DNA as an organization  because if you don't  you'll be unable to build trust  and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world. So this is good. It's not bad. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world. Now  the third meaning and corresponding principle of openness is about sharing. Now this is different than transparency. Transparency is about the communication of information. Sharing is about giving up assets  intellectual property. And there are all kinds of famous stories about this. IBM gave away     million dollars of software to the Linux movement  and that gave them a multi billion dollar payoff. Now  conventional wisdom says   Well  hey  our intellectual property belongs to us  and if someone tries to infringe it  we're going to get out our lawyers and we're going to sue them.  Well  it didn't work so well for the record labels  did it  I mean  they took   They had a technology disruption  and rather than taking a business model innovation to correspond to that  they took and sought a legal solution and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles is now suing children and is in danger of collapse. So we need to think differently about intellectual property. I'll give you an example. The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble. First of all  there aren't a lot of big inventions in the pipeline  and this is a big problem for human health  and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem  that they're about to fall off something called the patent cliff. Do you know about this  They're going to lose    to    percent of their revenue in the next    months. And what are you going to do  like  cut back on paper clips or something  No. We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research. The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research. They need to start sharing clinical trial data  and in doing so  create a rising tide that could lift all boats  not just for the industry but for humanity. Now  the fourth meaning of openness  and corresponding principle  is about empowerment. And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here. Knowledge and intelligence is power  and as it becomes more distributed  there's a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that's underway in the world today. The open world is bringing freedom. Now  take the Arab Spring. The debate about the role of social media and social change has been settled. You know  one word  Tunisia. And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too. But in the Tunisian revolution  the new media didn't cause the revolution  it was caused by injustice. Social media didn't create the revolution  it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore. But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government  it also drops the cost of dissent  of rebellion  and even insurrection in ways that people didn't understand. You know  during the Tunisian revolution  snipers associated with the regime were killing unarmed students in the street. So the students would take their mobile devices  take a picture  triangulate the location  send that picture to friendly military units  who'd come in and take out the snipers. You think that social media is about hooking up online  For these kids  it was a military tool to defend unarmed people from murderers. It was a tool of self defense. You know  as we speak today  young people are being killed in Syria  and up until three months ago  if you were injured on the street  an ambulance would pick you up  take you to the hospital  you'd go in  say  with a broken leg  and you'd come out with a bullet in your head. So these    somethings created an alternative health care system  where what they did is they used Twitter and basic publicly available tools that when someone's injured  a car would show up  it would pick them up  take them to a makeshift medical clinic  where you'd get medical treatment  as opposed to being executed. So this is a time of great change. Now  it's not without its problems. Up until two years ago  all revolutions in human history had a leadership  and when the old regime fell  the leadership and the organization would take power. Well  these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum  and politics abhors a vacuum  and unsavory forces can fill that  typically the old regime  or extremists  or fundamentalist forces. You can see this playing out today in Egypt. But that doesn't matter  because this is moving forward. The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag. The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here  okay  I mean  we're not putting this one back. The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom. I think  at the end of these four days  that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history is a positive one  and it's towards openness. If you go back a few hundred years  all around the world it was a very closed society. It was agrarian  and the means of production and political system was called feudalism  and knowledge was concentrated in the church and the nobility. People didn't know about things. There was no concept of progress. You were born  you lived your life and you died. But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention  and  over time  the society opened up. People started to learn about things  and when they did  the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled  or frozen  or failing. It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible for medicine when people had knowledge. So we saw the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther called the printing press  God's highest act of grace.  The creation of a corporation  science  the university  eventually the Industrial Revolution  and it was all good. But it came with a cost. And now  once again  the technology genie is out of the bottle  but this time it's different. The printing press gave us access to the written word. The Internet enables each of us to be a producer. The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge. The Internet gives us access  not just to information and knowledge  but to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people on a global basis. To me  this is not an information age  it's an age of networked intelligence. It's an age of vast promise  an age of collaboration  where the boundaries of our organizations are changing  of transparency  where sunlight is disinfecting civilization  an age of sharing and understanding the new power of the commons  and it's an age of empowerment and of freedom. Now  what I'd like to do is  to close  to share with you some research that I've been doing. I've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like  but I've been studying nature recently. You know  bees come in swarms and fish come in schools. Starlings  in the area around Edinburgh  in the moors of England  come in something called a murmuration  and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings of the birds  and throughout the day the starlings are out over a    mile radius sort of doing their starling thing. And at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature  and it's called a murmuration. And scientists that have studied this have said they've never seen an accident. Now  this thing has a function. It protects the birds. You can see on the right here  there's a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds  and apparently this is a frightening thing if you're a predator of starlings. And there's leadership  but there's no one leader. Now  is this some kind of fanciful analogy  or could we actually learn something from this  Well  the murmuration functions to record a number of principles  and they're basically the principles that I have described to you today. This is a huge collaboration. It's an openness  it's a sharing of all kinds of information  not just about location and trajectory and danger and so on  but about food sources. And there's a real sense of interdependence  that the individual birds somehow understand that their interests are in the interest of the collective. Perhaps like we should understand that business can't succeed in a world that's failing. Well  I look at this thing  and I get a lot of hope. Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring  and you see something like this that's underway. And imagine  just consider this idea  if you would  What if we could connect ourselves in this world through a vast network of air and glass  Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge  Could we start to share our intelligence  Could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team to create  perhaps  some kind of consciousness on a global basis  Well  if we could do this  we could attack some big problems in the world. And I look at this thing  and  I don't know  I get a lot of hope that maybe this smaller  networked  open world that our kids inherit might be a better one  and that this new age of networked intelligence could be an age of promise fulfilled and of peril unrequited. Let's do this. Thank you. So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia. I've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals. I might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital  but that isn't how my life turned out. In fact  I've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades  perhaps my proudest accomplishment. That's not to say that I've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles. After I graduated from the Yale Law School and got my first law job  my New Haven analyst  Dr. White  announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months  several years before I had planned to leave New Haven. White had been enormously helpful to me  and the thought of his leaving shattered me. My best friend Steve  sensing that something was terribly wrong  flew out to New Haven to be with me. Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings   I opened the door to my studio apartment. Steve would later tell me that  for all the times he had seen me psychotic  nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day. For a week or more  I had barely eaten. I was gaunt. I walked as though my legs were wooden. My face looked and felt like a mask. I had closed all the curtains in the apartment  so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness. The air was fetid  the room a shambles. Steve  both a lawyer and a psychologist  has treated many patients with severe mental illness  and to this day he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen. 'Hi ' I said  and then I returned to the couch  where I sat in silence for several moments. 'Thank you for coming  Steve. Crumbling world  word  voice. Tell the clocks to stop. Time is. Time has come.' 'White is leaving ' Steve said somberly. 'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave ' I moan. 'Gravity is pulling me down. I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'  As a young woman  I was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods. My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia  and gave me a prognosis of  grave.  That is  at best  I was expected to live in a board and care  and work at menial jobs. Fortunately  I did not actually enact that grave prognosis. Instead  I'm a chaired Professor of Law  Psychology and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law  I have many close friends and I have a beloved husband  Will  who's here with us today. He's definitely the star of my show. I'd like to share with you how that happened  and also describe my experience of being psychotic. I hasten to add that it's my experience  because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way. Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a brain disease. Its defining feature is psychosis  or being out of touch with reality. Delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness. Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive to evidence  and hallucinations are false sensory experiences. For example  when I'm psychotic I often have the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts. I sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain. Occasionally  I have hallucinations  like one time I turned around and saw a man with a raised knife. Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake. Often  speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence. Loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense  and if the words get jumbled up enough  it's called  word salad.  Contrary to what many people think  schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality. The schizophrenic mind is not split  but shattered. Everyone has seen a street person  unkempt  probably ill fed  standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting. This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia. But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status  and there are people with the illness who are full time professionals with major responsibilities. Several years ago  I decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey  and I want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view. So the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School. Quoting from my writings   My two classmates  Rebel and Val  and I had made the date to meet in the law school library on Friday night to work on our memo assignment together. But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways that made no sense. 'Memos are visitations ' I informed them. 'They make certain points. The point is on your head. Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone ' Rebel and Val looked at me as if they or I had been splashed in the face with cold water. 'What are you talking about  Elyn ' 'Oh  you know  the usual. Who's what  what's who  heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof. It's a flat surface. It's safe.' Rebel and Val followed and they asked what had gotten into me. 'This is the real me ' I announced  waving my arms above my head. And then  late on a Friday night  on the roof of the Yale Law School  I began to sing  and not quietly either. 'Come to the Florida sunshine bush. Do you want to dance ' 'Are you on drugs ' one asked. 'Are you high ' 'High  Me  No way  no drugs. Come to the Florida sunshine bush  where there are lemons  where they make demons.' 'You're frightening me ' one of them said  and Rebel and Val headed back into the library. I shrugged and followed them. Back inside  I asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as I was. 'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases ' I said. 'We've got to case the joint. I don't believe in joints  but they do hold your body together.'     It's an example of loose associations.     Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room  and once there  I couldn't settle down. My head was too full of noise  too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for. Sitting on my bed  I rocked back and forth  moaning in fear and isolation.  This episode led to my first hospitalization in America. I had two earlier in England. Continuing with the writings   The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment  and I began gibbering unintelligably as I had the night before  and he eventually brought me to the emergency room. Once there  someone I'll just call 'The Doctor' and his whole team of goons swooped down  lifted me high into the air  and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that I saw stars. Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps. A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before  half groan  half scream  barely human and pure terror. Then the sound came again  forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw.  This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization. One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that I was  gravely disabled.  To support this view  they wrote in my chart that I was unable to do my Yale Law School homework. I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven. During the next year  I would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital. At times  I spent up to    hours in mechanical restraints  arms tied  arms and legs tied down  arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest. I never struck anyone. I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats. If you've never been restrained yourself  you may have a benign image of the experience. There's nothing benign about it. Every week in the United States  it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints. They strangle  they aspirate their vomit  they suffocate  they have a heart attack. It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives. While I was preparing to write my student note for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints  I consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist  and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading  painful and frightening. He looked at me in a knowing way  and said   Elyn  you don't really understand  These people are psychotic. They're different from me and you. They wouldn't experience restraints as we would.  I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that  no  we're not that different from him. We don't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would. In fact  until very recently  and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view  that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe. I've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with that view. Today  I'd like to say I'm very pro psychiatry but very anti force. I don't think force is effective as treatment  and I think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness. Eventually  I came to Los Angeles to teach at the University of Southern California Law School. For years  I had resisted medication  making many  many efforts to get off. I felt that if I could manage without medication  I could prove that  after all  I wasn't really mentally ill  it was some terrible mistake. My motto was the less medicine  the less defective. My L.A. analyst  Dr. Kaplan  was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life  but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off. Quoting from the text   I started the reduction of my meds  and within a short time I began feeling the effects. After returning from a trip to Oxford  I marched into Kaplan's office  headed straight for the corner  crouched down  covered my face  and began shaking. All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers. They'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals. Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.' Even in this state  what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic  I refused to take more medication. The mission is not yet complete. Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan  I went to see Dr. Marder  a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects. He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness. Once in his office  I sat on his couch  folded over  and began muttering. 'Head explosions and people trying to kill. Is it okay if I totally trash your office ' 'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that ' said Marder. 'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me. Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong  Hundreds of thousands with thoughts  interdiction.' 'Elyn  do you feel like you're dangerous to yourself or others  I think you need to be in the hospital. I could get you admitted right away  and the whole thing could be very discrete.' 'Ha  ha  ha. You're offering to put me in hospitals  Hospitals are bad  they're mad  they're sad. One must stay away. I'm God  or I used to be.'  At that point in the text  where I said  I'm God  or I used to be   my husband made a marginal note. He said   Did you quit or were you fired    'I give life and I take it away. Forgive me  for I know not what I do.' Eventually  I broke down in front of friends  and everybody convinced me to take more medication. I could no longer deny the truth  and I could not change it. The wall that kept me  Elyn  Professor Saks  separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past  lay smashed and in ruins.  Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here  but I am. And I am  I think  for three reasons  First  I've had excellent treatment. Four  to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing  and excellent psychopharmacology. Second  I have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness. These relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth  and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms. Third  I work at an enormously supportive workplace at USC Law School. This is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them. It's also a very intellectually stimulating place  and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness. Even with all that   excellent treatment  wonderful family and friends  supportive work environment   I did not make my illness public until relatively late in life  and that's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing. If you hear nothing else today  please hear this  There are not  schizophrenics.  There are people with schizophrenia  and these people may be your spouse  they may be your child  they may be your neighbor  they may be your friend  they may be your coworker. So let me share some final thoughts. We need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness. The better we understand these illnesses  the better the treatments we can provide  and the better the treatments we can provide  the more we can offer people care  and not have to use force. Also  we must stop criminalizing mental illness. It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States. American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness  and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment. I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself. A message to the entertainment industry and to the press  On the whole  you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds. Please  continue to let us see characters in your movies  your plays  your columns  who suffer with severe mental illness. Portray them sympathetically  and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses. Recently  a friend posed a question  If there were a pill I could take that would instantly cure me  would I take it  The poet Rainer Maria Rilke was offered psychoanalysis. He declined  saying   Don't take my devils away  because my angels may flee too.  My psychosis  on the other hand  is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled. So would I take the pill  In an instant. That said  I don't wish to be seen as regretting the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill  nor am I asking anyone for their pity. What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not. What those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants  in the words of Sigmund Freud   to work and to love.  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking. And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor. Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter  and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature. Now  it's quite an old phenomenon  it was discovered     years ago. However  only recently  due to several technological advancements  we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking. So  a superconductor is defined by two properties. The first is zero electrical resistance  and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor. That sounds complicated  right  But what is electrical resistance  So  electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material. And these electrons  while flowing  they collide with the atoms  and in these collisions they lose a certain amount of energy. And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat  and you know that effect. However  inside a superconductor there are no collisions  so there is no energy dissipation. It's quite remarkable. Think about it. In classical physics  there is always some friction  some energy loss. But not here  because it is a quantum effect. But that's not all  because superconductors don't like magnetic fields. So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside  and it has the means to do that by circulating currents. Now  the combination of both effects    the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance    is exactly a superconductor. But the picture isn't always perfect  as we all know  and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor. Now  under proper conditions  which we have here  these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor. And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor  they come in discrete quantities. Why  Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics. And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles. In this movie here  you can see how they flow one by one discretely. This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles  but they behave like particles. So  this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking. But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field  Well  first there are strands of magnetic field left inside  but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around  because their movements dissipate energy  which breaks the superconductivity state. So what it actually does  it locks these strands  which are called fluxons  and it locks these fluxons in place. And by doing that  what it actually does is locking itself in place. Why  Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place  will change their configuration. So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works. I have here a superconductor  which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough. And when I place it on top of a regular magnet  it just stays locked in midair. Now  this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion. I can rearrange the fluxons  and it will be locked in this new configuration. Like this  or move it slightly to the right or to the left. So  this is quantum locking    actually locking    three dimensional locking of the superconductor. Of course  I can turn it upside down  and it will remain locked. Now  now that we understand that this so called levitation is actually locking  Yeah  we understand that. You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet  in which the magnetic field is the same all around  the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet. Why  Because as long as it rotates  the locking is maintained. You see  I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor. We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating  but can move freely all around. So  we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet. But how many fluxons  how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this  Well  we can calculate it  and it turns out  quite a lot. One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three inch disk. But that's not the amazing part yet  because there is something I haven't told you yet. And  yeah  the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin. And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than        times its own weight. It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong. Now  I can extend this circular magnet  and make whatever track I want. For example  I can make a large circular rail here. And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail  it moves freely. And again  that's not all. I can adjust its position like this  and rotate  and it freely moves in this new position. And I can even try a new thing  let's try it for the first time. I can take this disk and put it here  and while it stays here    don't move    I will try to rotate the track  and hopefully  if I did it correctly  it stays suspended. You see  it's quantum locking  not levitation. Now  while I'll let it circulate for a little more  let me tell you a little bit about superconductors. Now     Laughter     So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors  so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields  such as needed in MRI machines  particle accelerators and so on. But we can also store energy using superconductors  because we have no dissipation. And we could also produce power cables  to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations. Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable. But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking  Well  let me answer this simple question by giving you an example. Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand  three inch diameter  with a single difference. The superconducting layer  instead of being half a micron thin  being two millimeters thin  quite thin. This two millimeter thin superconducting layer could hold       kilograms  a small car  in my hand. Amazing. Thank you. I'd like to talk about my dad. My dad has Alzheimer's disease. He started showing the symptoms about    years ago  and he was officially diagnosed in     . Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating  he needs help getting dressed  he doesn't really know where he is or when it is  and it's been really  really hard. My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life  and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear. My dad's not alone. There's about    million people globally living with some kind of dementia  and by      they're expecting that to double to    million. That's a lot of people. Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia  the big numbers of people who get it  they frighten us. And because of that fear  we tend to do one of two things  We go into denial   It's not me  it has nothing to do with me  it's never going to happen to me.  Or  we decide that we're going to prevent dementia  and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us. I'm looking for a third way  I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Prevention is good  and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's. I'm eating right  I'm exercising every day  I'm keeping my mind active  that's what the research says you should do. But the research also shows that there's nothing that will     percent protect you. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. That's what happened with my dad. My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess  bridge and writing op eds. He got dementia anyway. If the monster wants you  the monster's gonna get you. Especially if you're me  'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families. So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease. Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father  and researching what it's like to live with dementia  I'm focusing on three things in my preparation  I'm changing what I do for fun  I'm working to build my physical strength  and    this is the hard one    I'm trying to become a better person. Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia  it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself. You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends  because you don't know who they are. It's confusing to watch television  and often very frightening. And reading is just about impossible. When you care for someone with dementia  and you get training  they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar  hands on  open ended. With my dad  that turned out to be letting him fill out forms. He was a college professor at a state school  he knows what paperwork looks like. He'll sign his name on every line  he'll check all the boxes  he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers. But it got me thinking  what would my caregivers do with me  I'm my father's daughter. I read  I write  I think about global health a lot. Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins  Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color  So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on. I've always liked to draw  so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it. I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box. And I'm teaching myself to knit  which so far I can knit a blob. But  you know  it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it. Because the more things that are familiar  the more things my hands know how to do  the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore. They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier  easier for their caregivers to look after  and it may even slow the progress of the disease. That all seems like win to me. I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can. A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms  as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance  you get muscle tremors  and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile. They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move. So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance. I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance  so that when I start to lose it  I'll still be able to be mobile. I'm doing weight bearing exercise  so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither  I have more time that I can still move around. Finally  the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person. My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's  and he's kind and loving now. I've seen him lose his intellect  his sense of humor  his language skills  but I've also seen this  He loves me  he loves my sons  he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers. And that love makes us want to be around him  even now. even when it's so hard. When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world  his naked heart still shines. I was never as kind as my dad  and I was never as loving. And what I need now is to learn to be like that. I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia  it will survive. I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease. What I want is a cure in the next    years  soon enough to protect me. But if it comes for me  I'm going to be ready. Thank you. About    years ago  my grandfather  a young man  walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that  and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen  none other than Mae West  the heartthrob of the '  s  and he could never forget her. In fact  when he had his daughter many years later  he wanted to name her after Mae West  but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West  The Indian family said  no way  So when my twin brother Kaesava was born  he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. He said  if Mae West can be M A E  why can't Keshava be K A E  So he changed Kaesava's spelling. Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago. He decided to spell  or  rather  misspell Raehan with an A E. You know  my grandfather died many years ago when I was little  but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. That for me is successful legacy.  Laughs  You know  as for me  my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. We actually sit every few years  argue  disagree  fight  and actually come up with our very own     year plan. Our friends think we're mad. Our parents think we're cuckoo. Because  you know  we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom  but we both like to live larger than life. I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi  Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. This is me being a rock star  even if it's in my own house. You know  So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan    years ago  we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. What do we mean by beyond ourselves  Well     years  we calculated  is at the end of our direct contact with the world. There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond     years  so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. You know  I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind  I'm an artist. Until I made a cartoon about     . It caused so much trouble for me. I was so upset. You know  a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me  and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. You know  the      cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. I said  I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw  because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. You know  sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. One of the most important things in my     year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves. You know  we carry so much baggage  from our parents  from our society  from so many people    fears  insecurities    and our     year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. The latest date I put was  I said  I am going to expire my fear of my leftist  feminist mother in law  and this today is the date   Laughs  She's watching.  Laughter  Anyway  you know  I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself  and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. And this directly translates into my paintings. But like my friends  I can do that really well on Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Flickr  YouTube. Name it  I'm on it. I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world  you know  But that comes with a problem. It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory  but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology. We only remember what we want to. At least I do. And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory  you know  And if technology is not a metaphor for memory  what is it  Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our     year plan to really curate our digital legacy. That is a picture of my mother  and she recently got a Facebook account. You know where this is going. And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page.  Laughter  And I actually untagged myself first  then I picked up the phone. I said   Mom  you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again.  And she said   Why  You look so cute  darling.  I said   You just don't understand.  Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. You know  whether you agree with  you know  legacy or not  we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. So Netra and I really wanted to use our     year plan to curate this digital legacy  and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. How  you may ask  Well  when I think of the future  I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. I can actually visualize my future approaching. I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting  I actually imagine I'm behind the painting  it already exists  and someone's looking at it  and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. Are they feeling it from their heart  or is it just a cerebral thing  And it really informs my painting. Even when I do an art show  I really think about  what should people walk away with  I remember when I was     I did  I wanted to do my first art exhibition  and I wanted the whole world to know about it. I didn't know TED then  but what I did was I closed my eyes tight  and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in  dressed up  looking beautiful  my paintings with all the light  and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show  giving credibility to me. And I woke up from my visualization and I said  who was that  I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha  two very famous Indian actresses  like the Meryl Streeps of India. As it turned out  next morning I wrote a letter to both of them  and Shabana Azmi replied  and came and launched my very first show    years ago. And what a bang it started my career with  You know  when we think of time in this way  we can curate not only the future but also the past. This is a picture of my family  and that is Netra  my wife. She's the co creator of my     year plan. Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra  but I hate history. I keep saying   Nets  you live in the past while I'll create the future  and when I'm done  you can study about it.  She gave me an indulgent smile  and as punishment  she said   Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history  and you are sitting in it  and I'm grading you.  I'm like   Oh  God.  I went. I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India  Pakistan  from Britain  and I said   Wow.  Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. I said   Wow   again. Then she said   Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity.  History as an imaging tool  I was so inspired. I went and created my own version of Indian history. I actually included stories from my grandmother. She used to work for the telephone exchange  and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten. And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But  you know  I include things like that. This is my version of Indian history. You know  if this is so  it occurred to me that maybe  just maybe  the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. Go tell Facebook to figure that out  Netra and I don't write our     year plan for someone else to come and execute it in     years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying  from the past  okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. You know  I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. Education is great. It really teaches us who we are  and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world  but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have. It lets us create who we are  and curate what is to come. I like to think    Thank you. I like to think of myself as a storyteller  where my past and my future are only stories  my stories  waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own     year story. Thank you so much. Shukran   Applause  In the ocean  what is the common point between oil  plastic and radioactivity  On the top line  this is the BP oil spill  billions of barrels of oil gushing in the Gulf of Mexico. The middle line is millions of tons of plastic debris accumulating in our ocean  and the third line is radioactive material leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant in the Pacific Ocean. Well  the three big problems have in common that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces. This should make us feel very  terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful  because if we have the power to create these problems  we may as well have the power to remediate these problems. But what about natural forces  Well  that's exactly what I want to talk about today  is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man made problems. When the BP oil spill happened  I was working at MIT  and I was in charge of developing an oil spill cleaning technology. And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working. More than     of these boats  which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange  were used  but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface  and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected. I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT  but it was a very long term view of how to develop technology  and it was going to be a very expensive technology  and also it would be patented. So I wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast  that would be cheap  and that would be open source  so  because oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico  and that would be using renewable energy. So I quit my dream job  and I moved to New Orleans  and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening. Currently  what they were doing is that they were using these small fishing boats  and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt. If you're using the exact same amount of surface of oil absorbent  but you're just paying attention to natural patterns  and if you're going up the winds  you can collect a lot more material. If you're multiplying the rig  so you multiply how many layers of absorbent you're using  you can collect a lot more. But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds  the surface currents and the waves. These are enormous forces. So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind. So this didn't require any invention. We just took a simple sailing boat and we tried to pull something long and heavy  but as we tacked back and forth  what we lost was two things  we were losing pulling power and direction. And so  I thought  what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front  would we have better control  So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front  and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy  so that's a four meter long object just to pull  and I was surprised with just a    centimeter rudder  I could control four meters of absorbent. Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot  and so you see the robot has a front rudder here. Normally it's at the back. And  playing  I realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing  and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second  more maneuverable than a normal boat. Then I started publishing online  and some friends from Korea  they started being interested in this  and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder  so we started interacting with this  and it was slightly better  although it was very small and a bit off balance  but then we thought  what if we have more than two points of control  What if the entire boat becomes a point of control  What if the entire boat changes shape  So    Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  And so that's the beginning of Protei  and that's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it  and the properties of sailing that we get are very superior compared to a normal boat. When we're turning  we have the feeling of surfing  and the way it's going up wind  it's very efficient. This is low speed  low wind speed  and the maneuverability is very increased  and here I'm going to do a small jibe  and look at the position of the sail. What's happening is that  because the boat changes shape  the position of the front sail and the main sail are different to the wind. We're catching wind from both sides. And this is exactly what we're looking  for  if we want to pull something long and heavy. We don't want to lose pulling power  nor direction. So  I wanted to know if this was possible to put this at an industrial level  so we made a large boat with a large sail  and with a very light hull  inflatable  very small footprint  so we have a very big size and power ratio. After this  we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system  so we used the same system but we added a structure to it so we could activate the machine. So  we used the same bladder inflated system  and we took it for testing. So this is happening in the Netherlands. We tried in the water without any skin or ballast just to see how it works. And then we mounted a camera for controlling it  but quickly we saw that we would need a lot more weight at the bottom  so we had to take it back to the lab  and then we built a skin around it  we put batteries  remote controllers  and then we put it in the water and then we let it go in the water and see how well it would work  so let some rope out  and hope it's going to work  and it worked okay  but we still have a long way. Our small prototype has given us good insight that it's working very well  but we still need to work a lot more on this. So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology. We went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two rudders to multiple rudders to the whole boat changing shape  and the more we are moving forward  and the more the design looks simple and cute.  Laughter  But I wanted to show you a fish because    In fact  it's very different from a fish. A fish will move because    by changing like this  but our boat is propelled by the wind still  and the hull controls the trajectory. So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one  but it's a good one for making demos. So the first thing as I show you in the video is that we may be able to control the trajectory of a sailing boat better  or we may be able to never be in irons  so never facing the wind  we always can catch the wind from both sides. But new properties of a sailing boat. So if you're looking at the boat from this side  this might remind you of an airplane profile. An airplane  when you're moving in this direction  starts to lift  and that's how it takes off. Now  if you're taking the same system  and you're putting vertical  you're bending  and if you're moving this way forward  your instinct will tell you that you might go this way  but if you're moving fast enough  you might create what we call lateral lift  so we could get further or closer to the wind. Other property is this  A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back  and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat  but because this doesn't have either a centerboard or a rudder  we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance. The other thing is  most boats  when they reach a certain speed  and they are going on waves  they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water  and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost. But if we're going with the flow  if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong  but if you're going with the flow  we may absorb a lot of environmental noises  so the wave energy  to actually save some energy to move forward. So we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy  but the idea is  what is the purpose of technology if it doesn't reach the right hands  Normal technology or innovation happens like this  Somebody has an interesting idea  some other scientist or engineer  they take it to the next level  they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it  and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it  and then  eventually  a buyer will buy it  and we hope that they are going to use  it  for a good purpose. What we really want is that this innovation happens continuously. The inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same time  but this would be sterile if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process. What you really want is not a sequential  not parallel development. You want to have a network of innovation. You want everybody  like we're doing now  to work at the same time  and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information  and that's exactly what open hardware is about. It's to replace competition by collaboration. It's to transform any new product into a new market. So what is open hardware  Essentially  open hardware is a license. It's just an intellectual property setup. It means that everybody is free to use  modify and distribute  and in exchange we only ask for two things  The name is credited    the name of the project    and also the people who make improvement  they share back with the community. So it's a very simple condition. And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans  but quickly after I wanted to publish and share this information  so I made a Kickstarter  which is a crowd fundraising platform  and in about one month we fundraised        dollars. With this money  I hired a team of young engineers from all over the world  and we rented a factory in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We were peer learning  we were engineering  we were making things  prototyping  but most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible  to fail as quickly as possible  to learn from. This is a proud member of Protei from Korea  and on the right side  this is a multiple masts design proposed by a team in Mexico. This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine in New York  and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw  and she documented every step of the process  and she published it on Instructables  which is a website for sharing inventions. Less than one week after  this is a team in Eindhoven  it's a school of engineering. They made it  but they eventually published a simplified design. They also made it into an Instructable  and in less than one week  they had almost        views  and they got many new friends. We're working on also simpler technology  not that complex  with younger people and also older people  like this dinosaur is from Mexico.  Laughter  So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape shifting hull. And what puts us together is that we have a common  at least  global understanding of what the word  business  is  or what it should be. This is how most work today. Business as usual is saying  what's most important is to make lots of profit  and you'll be using technology for that  and people will be your work force  instrumentalized  and environment is usually the last priority. It will be just a way to  say  greenwash your audience and  say  increase your price tag. What we're trying to do  or what we believe  because this is how we believe the world really works  is that without the environment you have nothing. We have the people so we need to protect each other  yes  and we're a technology company  and profit is necessary to make this happen.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  If we have the courage to understand or accept that this actually how the world really works  and this is the order of priority that we need to choose  then it makes obvious why we need to choose open hardware for developing environmental technology  because we need to share information. What's next for us  So  this small machine that you've seen  we're hoping to make small toys like one meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade    so replace the remote control parts by Androids  so the mobile phone  and Arduino micro controller  so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone  your tablet. Then what we want to do is create six meter versions so we can test the maximum performance of these machines  so we can go at very  very high speed. So imagine yourself. You are laying down in a flexible torpedo  sailing at high speed  controlling the shape of the hull with your legs and controlling the sail with your arms. So that's what we're looking for developing.  Applause  And we replace the human being    to go  for example  for measuring radioactivity  you don't want a human to be sailing those robots    with batteries  motors  micro controllers and sensors. This is what our teammates  we dream of at night. We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills  or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean  or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi player video game engines to control many of these machines  to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries. Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans. Thank you very much.  Applause  I'm a gamer  so I like to have goals. I like special missions and secret objectives. So here's my special mission for this talk  I'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes. Literally  you will live seven and a half minutes longer than you would have otherwise  just because you watched this talk. Some of you are looking a little bit skeptical. That's okay  because check it out    I have math to prove that it is possible. It won't make much sense now. I'll explain it all later  just pay attention to the number at the bottom    .         minutes. That will be my gift to you if I'm successful in my mission. Now  you have a secret mission too. Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes. And I think you should do something unusual with them  because these are bonus minutes. You weren't going to have them anyway. Now  because I'm a game designer  you might be thinking to yourself  I know what she wants us to do with those minutes  she wants us to spend them playing games. Now this is a totally reasonable assumption  given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games. For example  in my first TED Talk  I did propose that we should spend    billion hours a week  as a planet  playing video games. Now     billion hours  it's a lot of time. It's so much time  in fact  that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk  is this  Jane  games are great and all  but on your deathbed  are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds  This idea is so pervasive    that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret    that I hear it literally everywhere I go. For example  true story  Just a few weeks ago  this cab driver  upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developers' conference  turned around and said    and I quote     I hate games. Waste of life. Imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time.  Now  I want to take this problem seriously. I want games to be a force for good in the world. I don't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing  time that I encouraged them to spend. So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately. When we're on our deathbeds  will we regret the time we spent playing games  Now  this may surprise you  but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question. It's true. Hospice workers  the people who take care of us at the end of our lives  recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds. And that's what I want to share with you today    the top five regrets of the dying. Number one  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. Number two  I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends. Number three  I wish I had let myself be happier. Number four  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self. And number five  I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams  instead of what others expected of me. Now  as far as I know  no one ever told one of the hospice workers   I wish I'd spent more time playing video games   but when I hear these top five regrets of the dying  I can't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill. For example  I wish I hadn't worked so hard. For many people  this means  I wish I'd spent more time with my family  with my kids when they were growing up. Well  we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits. A recent study from Brigham Young University School of Family Life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real life relationships with them.  I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends.  Hundreds of millions of people use social games like FarmVille or Words With Friends to stay in daily contact with real life friends and family. A recent study from the University of Michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship management tools. They help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from  if we weren't playing games together.  I wish I'd let myself be happier.  Well  here I can't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at East Carolina University that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression. Just    minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long term increases in happiness.  I wish I'd had the courage to express my true self.  Well  avatars are a way to express our true selves  our most heroic  idealized version of who we might become. You can see that in this alter ego portrait by Robbie Cooper of a gamer with his avatar. And Stanford University has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life  making us more courageous  more ambitious  more committed to our goals.  I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams  and not what others expected of me.  Are games doing this yet  I'm not sure  so I've left a Super Mario question mark. We're going to come back to this one. But in the meantime  perhaps you're wondering  who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets  And it's true  I've never worked in a hospice  I've never been on my deathbed. But recently I did spend three months in bed  wanting to die. Really wanting to die. Now let me tell you that story. It started two years ago  when I hit my head and got a concussion. The concussion didn't heal properly  and after    days  I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches  nausea  vertigo  memory loss  mental fog. My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain  I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. For me that meant no reading  no writing  no video games  no work or email  no running  no alcohol  no caffeine. In other words    and I think you see where this is going    no reason to live. Of course it's meant to be funny  but in all seriousness  suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries. It happens to one in three  and it happened to me. My brain started telling me   Jane  you want to die.  It said   You're never going to get better.  It said   The pain will never end.  And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life  which is the time that I said to myself after    days    and I will never forget this moment    I said   I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.  Now  why a game  I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game    and this is in the scientific literature    we tackle tough challenges with more creativity  more determination  more optimism  and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real life challenge  so I created a role playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer. Now this became my new secret identity  and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister    I have an identical twin sister named Kelly    and tell her   I'm playing a game to heal my brain  and I want you to play with me.  This was an easier way to ask for help. She became my first ally in the game  my husband Kiyash joined next  and together we identified and battled the bad guys. Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process  things like bright lights and crowded spaces. We also collected and activated power ups. This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good  just a little bit productive. Things like cuddling my dog for    minutes  or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once. Now the game was that simple  Adopt a secret identity  recruit your allies  battle the bad guys  activate the power ups. But even with a game so simple  within just a couple days of starting to play  that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms. That lasted for more than a year  and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms  even while I was still in pain  I stopped suffering. Now what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online  explaining how to play. But not everybody has a concussion  obviously  not everyone wants to be  the slayer   so I renamed the game SuperBetter. And soon  I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity  recruiting their own allies  and they were getting  super better   facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain  depression and Crohn's disease. Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS. And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me. They talked about feeling stronger and braver. They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family. And they even talked about feeling happier  even though they were in pain  even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives. Now at the time  I'm thinking to myself  what is going on here  I mean  how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious  and in some cases life and death  circumstances  I mean  if it hadn't worked for me  there's no way I would have believed it was possible. Well  it turns out there's some science here  too. Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event. And that's what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists call post traumatic growth  which is not something we usually hear about. We usually hear about post traumatic stress disorder. But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely. Instead  we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives. Here are the top five things that people with post traumatic growth say   My priorities have changed.   I'm not afraid to do what makes me happy.   I feel closer to my friends and family.   I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.   I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.   I'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams.  Now  does this sound familiar  It should  because the top five traits of post traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying. Now this is interesting  right  It seems that somehow  a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets. But how does it work  How do you get from trauma to growth  Or better yet  is there a way to get all the benefits of post traumatic growth without the trauma  without having to hit your head in the first place  That would be good  right  I wanted to understand the phenomenon better  so I devoured the scientific literature  and here's what I learned. There are four kinds of strength  or resilience  that contribute to post traumatic growth  and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience  and you don't need a trauma to do it. I could tell you what these four types of strength are  but I'd rather you experience them firsthand. I'd rather we all start building them up together right now. Here's what we're going to do. We'll play a quick game together. This is where you earn the seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier. All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests. And I feel like you can do it. I have confidence in you. So  everybody ready  This is your first quest. Here we go. Pick one  Stand up and take three steps  or make your hands into fists  raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds  go  All right  I like the people doing both. You are overachievers. Very good. Well done  everyone. That is worth    physical resilience  which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster. We know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still. That's all it takes. Every single second that you are not sitting still  you are actively improving the health of your heart  and your lungs and brains. Everybody ready for your next quest  I want you to snap your fingers exactly    times  or count backwards from     by seven  like this         ... Go  Don't give up. Don't let the people counting down from     interfere with your counting to   . Nice. Wow. That's the first time I've ever seen that. Bonus physical resilience. Well done  everyone. Now that's worth    mental resilience  which means you have more mental focus  more discipline  determination and willpower. We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle. It gets stronger the more you exercise it. So tackling a tiny challenge without giving up  even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly    times or counting backwards from     by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower. So good job. Quest number three. Pick one  Because of the room  fate's really determined this for you  but here are the two options. If you're inside  find a window and look out of it. If you're outside  find a window and look in. Or do a quick YouTube or Google image search for  baby  your favorite animal.   Do it on your phones  or just shout out some baby animals  and I'll put them on the screen. So  what do we want to see  Sloth  giraffe  elephant  snake. Okay  let's see what we got. Baby dolphin and baby llamas. Everybody look. Got that  Okay  one more. Baby elephant. We're clapping for that  That's amazing. All right  what we're just feeling there is plus one emotional resilience  which means you have the ability to provoke powerful  positive emotions like curiosity or love  which we feel looking at baby animals  when you need them most. Here's a secret from the scientific literature for you. If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour  a day  a week  you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing. And this is called the three to one positive emotion ratio. It's my favorite SuperBetter trick  so keep it up. All right  pick one  last quest  Shake someone's hand for six seconds  or send someone a quick thank you by text  email  Facebook or Twitter. Go  Looking good  looking good. Nice  nice. Keep it up. I love it  All right  everybody  that is    social resilience  which means you actually get more strength from your friends  your neighbors  your family  your community. Now  a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude. Touch is even better. Here's one more secret for you  Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream  now that's the trust hormone. That means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other. This will linger during the break  so take advantage of the networking opportunities. Well  you have successfully completed your four quests  let's see if I've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life. Now I get to share one more little bit of science with you. It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience    physical  mental  emotional and social    live    years longer than everyone else. So this is true. If you are regularly achieving the three to one positive emotion ratio  if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time  if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day  if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower  you will live    years longer than everyone else  and here's where that math I showed you earlier comes in. So  the average life expectancy in the U.S. and the U.K. is   .  years  but we know from more than       peer reviewed scientific studies that you can add    years of life by boosting your four types of resilience. So every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience  you're actually earning .    more years of life or    more days of life  or        more minutes of life  which means every single day  you are earning     minutes of life  or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience  like we just did together  you are earning  .         more minutes of life. Congratulations  those seven and a half minutes are all yours. You totally earned them. Yeah  Awesome. Wait  wait  wait. You still have your special mission  your secret mission. How are you going to spend these minutes of bonus life  Well  here's my suggestion. These seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie's wishes. You can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes. Pretty clever  right  So  if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy  or that gets you physically active  or puts you in touch with someone you care about  or even just tackling a tiny challenge  you're going to boost your resilience  so you're going to earn more minutes. And the good news is  you can keep going like that. Every hour of the day  every day of your life  all the way to your deathbed  which will now be    years later than it would have otherwise. And when you get there  more than likely  you will not have any of those top five regrets  because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams. And with    extra years  you might even have enough time to play a few more games. Thank you. I'm going to start with a little story. So  I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was    years old  I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete  over four months  slowly wasting away until I was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst. I had basically digested away my body. And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip  my first one ever actually  on Old Rag Mountain in West Virginia  and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog. That night  I was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type   diabetic in full blown ketoacidosis. And I recovered  thanks to the miracles of modern medicine  insulin and other things  and gained all my weight back and more. And something festered inside me after this happened. What I thought about was  what caused the diabetes  You see  diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself  and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin. And this is what I thought for a long period of time  and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit  the microbes that do bad things. And that's where I need my assistant here now. You may recognize her. So  I went yesterday  I apologize  I skipped a few of the talks  and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building  and they sell toys  giant microbes. And here we go  So you have caught flesh eating disease if you caught that one. I gotta get back out my baseball ability here. So  unfortunately or not surprisingly  most of the microbes they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens. Everybody focuses on the things that kill us  and that's what I was focusing on. And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes  and those microbes actually do us good much of the time  rather than killing us. And so  we've known about this for some period of time. People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us  I know you're not paying attention to me  but ... The microbes that cover us. And if you look at them in the microscope  you can see that we actually have    times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells. There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain. We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms. And unfortunately  if you want to learn about the microorganisms  just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient. And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing. It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their DNA. And that's what I've been doing for    years  using DNA sequencing  collecting samples from various places  including the human body  reading the DNA sequence and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place. And what's amazing  when you use this technology  for example  looking at humans  we're not just covered in a sea of microbes. There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us. We have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us. And so this microbial diversity differs between people  and what people have been thinking about in the last     maybe    years is  maybe these microbes  this microbial cloud in and on us  and the variation between us  may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us. And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you. It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type   diabetes is not fighting a pathogen  but is in fact trying to    miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you. And somehow maybe the microbial community that's in and on me got off  and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body. And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is  what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques in particular  to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us. And I want to tell you a story about a personal project. My first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave  right around the corner from here at Georgetown. I gave a talk  and a family friend who happened to be the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk  and came up to me afterwards saying  they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people. And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants. And so I started a collaboration with this person  Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein  to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient. And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there  but the reason I want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project. They take the donor ileum  which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community  say Crohn's disease  and they sterilized the donor ileum. Cleaned out all the microbes  and then put it in the recipient. They did this because this was common practice in medicine  even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea. And fortunately  in the course of this project  the transplant surgeons and the other people decided  forget common practice. We have to switch. So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor  and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant. And so  people    this is a study that I did now. In the last few years there's been a great expansion in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people. There's something called the Human Microbiome Project that's going on in the United States  and MetaHIT going on in Europe  and a lot of other projects. And when people have done a variety of studies  they have learned things such as  when a baby is born  during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother. There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections  some of those risk factors may be due to mis colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal. And a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system  helps in fighting off pathogens  helps in our metabolism  and determining our metabolic rate  probably determines our odor  and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways. And so  these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community  this cloud  the non pathogens that live in and on us. And one area that I think is very interesting  which many of you may have now that we've thrown microbes into the crowd  is something that I would call  germophobia.  So people are really into cleanliness  right  We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters  people are washing every part of them all of the time  we pump antibiotics into our food  into our communities  we take antibiotics excessively. And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick  but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world  that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us. And excessive use of antibiotics  in particular in children  has been shown to be associated with  again  risk factors for obesity  for autoimmune diseases  for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community. So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not  or we can kill it with antibiotics  but what can we do to restore it  I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics. Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you. And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases. There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat  prevent  necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community. And it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants. But probiotics are sort of a very  very simple solution. Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them  maybe five species in them  and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species. So what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us  Well  one thing that animals seem to do is  they eat poo    coprophagia. And it turns out that many veterinarians  old school veterinarians in particular  have been doing something called  poo tea   not booty  but poo tea  to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that  where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal. Although  unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side  and you can put your hand into its rumen  it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system  so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants  where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth  they are delivering a community of probiotics  a community of microbes from a healthy donor  through the other end. And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years. Transplants of the feces  of the microbes from the feces  from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic C. dif infections in some people. Now what these transplants  these fecal transplants  or the poo tea suggest to me  and many other people have come up with this same idea  is that the microbial community in and on us  it's an organ. We should view it as a functioning organ  part of ourselves. We should treat it carefully and with respect  and we do not want to mess with it  say by C sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness  without some real good justification. And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of  say      patients who have Crohn's disease and     people who don't have Crohn's disease. Or     people who took antibiotics when they were little  and     people who did not take antibiotics. And we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences. And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not just correlative differences  but causative. Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this  but people are now using these technologies because they've gotten very cheap  to study the microbes in and on a variety of people. So  in wrapping up  what I want to tell you about is  I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes. It turns out that my father was an M.D.  actually studied hormones. I told him many times that I was tired  thirsty  not feeling very good. And he shrugged it off  I think he either thought I was just complaining a lot  or it was the typical M.D.  nothing can be wrong with my children.  We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology meeting as family in Quebec. And I was getting up every five minutes to pee  and drinking everybody's water at the table  and I think they all thought I was a druggie. But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community  my father as an example  sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes. The microbial cloud  it is right in front of us. We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible. They're microbes. They're tiny. But we can see them through their DNA  we can see them through the effects that they have on people. And what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine. It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us  but it might. What we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people  so that we can understand what they're doing to our lives. We are them. They are us. Thank you. So  how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn't have been driving  Maybe you're out on the road for a long day  and you just wanted to get home. You were tired  but you felt you could drive a few more miles. Maybe you thought  I've had less to drink than everybody else  I should be the one to go home. Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere. Does this sound familiar to you  Now  in those situations  wouldn't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push  and the car would get you home safely  Now  that's been the promise of the self driving car  the autonomous vehicle  and it's been the dream since at least       when General Motors showcased this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair. Now  it's been one of those dreams that's always seemed about    years in the future. Now  two weeks ago  that dream took a step forward  when the state of Nevada granted Google's self driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle  clearly establishing that it's legal for them to test it on the roads in Nevada. Now  California's considering similar legislation  and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas. Now  in my lab at Stanford  we've been working on autonomous cars too  but with a slightly different spin on things. You see  we've been developing robotic race cars  cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance. Now  why would we want to do such a thing  Well  there's two really good reasons for this. First  we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car  that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers. Now  if you're like me  and the other    percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers  you understand that's a very high bar. There's another reason as well. Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road  all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible  we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can. Now  you may push the car to the limits not because you're driving too fast  but because you've hit an icy patch of road  conditions have changed. In those situations  we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided. I must confess  there's kind of a third motivation as well. You see  I have a passion for racing. In the past  I've been a race car owner  a crew chief and a driving coach  although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting. One of the things that we've developed in the lab    we've developed several vehicles    is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car. It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition. But this is P . It's an entirely student built electric vehicle  which through using its rear wheel drive and front wheel steer by wire can drift around corners. It can get sideways like a rally car driver  always able to take the tightest curve  even on slippery  changing surfaces  never spinning out. We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle  on Shelley  an autonomous race car that has raced at     miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats  gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun  the wind and the rain  and navigated the     turns and   .  miles of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route in Colorado with nobody at the wheel. I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun doing this. But in fact  there's something else that we've developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars. We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers. As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform  we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts. And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing. Now  we can take a map of a race track  we can take a mathematical model of a car  and with some iteration  we can actually find the fastest way around that track. We line that up with data that we record from a professional driver  and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable. Yes  there are subtle differences here  but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line  without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner  and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here. Not only that  they're able to do it lap after lap after lap. They're able to go out and consistently do this  pushing the car to the limits every single time. It's extraordinary to watch. You put them in a new car  and after a few laps  they've found the fastest line in that car  and they're off to the races. It really makes you think  we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain. So as researchers  that's what we decided to find out. We decided to instrument not only the car  but also the race car driver  to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this. Now  this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes to the head of John Morton. John Morton is a former Can Am and IMSA driver  who's also a class champion at Le Mans. Fantastic driver  and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research. She's putting electrodes on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John's brain as he races around the track. Now  clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track. However  neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this. For instance  the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves. In contrast  theta waves are associated with a lot of cognitive activity  like visual processing  things where the driver is thinking quite a bit. Now  we can measure this  and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves. This gives us a measure of mental workload  how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively at any point along the track. Now  we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track  so we headed down south to Laguna Seca. Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between Salinas and Monterey. It has a curve there called the Corkscrew. Now  the Corkscrew is a chicane  followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories. Now  the strategy for driving this as explained to me was  you aim for the bush in the distance  and as the road falls away  you realize it was actually the top of a tree. All right  so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford  we were able to take John there and put him behind the wheel of a      Porsche Abarth Carrera. Life is way too short for boring cars. So  here you see John on the track  he's going up the hill    Oh  Somebody liked that    and you can see  actually  his mental workload    measuring here in the red bar    you can see his actions as he approaches. Now watch  he has to downshift. And then he has to turn left. Look for the tree  and down. Not surprisingly  you can see this is a pretty challenging task. You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this  as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity. But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn't increase. I'm going to take you around now to the other side of the track. Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out. He's going to have to correct for that with steering. So watch as John does this here. Watch the mental workload  and watch the steering. The car begins to slide out  dramatic maneuver to correct it  and no change whatsoever in the mental workload. Not a challenging task. In fact  entirely reflexive. Now  our data processing on this is still preliminary  but it really seems that these phenomenal feats that the race car drivers are performing are instinctive. They are things that they have simply learned to do. It requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats. And their actions are fantastic. This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation. Now  this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles. We've started to ask the question  Can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive  Can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers  introduce it to our cars  and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future  That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans. But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well. Do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur  Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner  a coach  someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential  Can  in fact  the technology not simply replace humans  but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we're all capable of  So  as we move forward into this technological future  I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment. What is the ideal balance of human and machine  And as we think about that  let's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind. Thank you. I study the future of crime and terrorism  and frankly  I'm afraid. I'm afraid by what I see. I sincerely want to believe that technology can bring us the techno utopia that we've been promised  but  you see  I've spent a career in law enforcement  and that's informed my perspective on things. I've been a street police officer  an undercover investigator  a counter terrorism strategist  and I've worked in more than    countries around the world. I've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society  and that's informed my opinions. My work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational. They have taught me a lot  and I'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you. Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at  the ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community  these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world  but in the hands of suicide bombers  the future can look quite different. I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer. In those days  this was the height of technology. Laugh though you will  all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did. Twenty years later  criminals are still using mobile phones  but they're also building their own mobile phone networks  like this one  which has been deployed in all    states of Mexico by the narcos. They have a national encrypted radio communications system. Think about that. Think about the innovation that went into that. Think about the infrastructure to build it. And then think about this  Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco   Laughter  How is this possible   Laughter  It makes no sense.  Applause  We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do. Technology has made our world increasingly open  and for the most part  that's great  but all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Consider the      terrorist attack on Mumbai. The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK   s  explosives and hand grenades. They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. They were armed with mobile phones. They had BlackBerries. They had access to satellite imagery. They had satellite phones  and they even had night vision goggles. But perhaps their greatest innovation was this. We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan  where they monitored the BBC  al Jazeera  CNN and Indian local stations. They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed. They did all of this in real time. The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government. What did they do with this  They used it to great effect. At one point during the    hour siege  the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims. They came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel  and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed. And they said to him   Who are you  and what are you doing here   And the man replied   I'm just an innocent schoolteacher.  Of course  the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj. They picked up his identification  and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room  where the terrorist war room Googled him  and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said   Your hostage  is he heavyset  Is he bald in front  Does he wear glasses    Yes  yes  yes   came the answers. The op center had found him and they had a match. He was not a schoolteacher. He was the second wealthiest businessman in India  and after discovering this information  the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai. We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook  but the fact of the matter is  our openness can be used against us. Terrorists are doing this. A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die. This is the world that we live in. During the Mumbai siege  terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand  they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand. In the end      people were gravely wounded and over     men  women and children lost their lives that day. Think about what happened. During this    hour siege on Mumbai     men armed not just with weapons  but with technology  were able to bring a city of    million people to a standstill. Ten people brought    million people to a standstill  and this traveled around the world. This is what radicals can do with openness. This was done nearly four years ago. What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have  What will they do tomorrow  The ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially  and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil. It's not just about terrorism  though. There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime. You see  you can now commit more crime as well. In the old days  it was a knife and a gun. Then criminals moved to robbing trains. You could rob     people on a train  a great innovation. Moving forward  the Internet allowed things to scale even more. In fact  many of you will remember the recent Sony PlayStation hack. In that incident  over     million people were robbed. Think about that. When in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob     million  Of course  it's not just about stealing things. There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit. Many of you will remember this super cute video from the last TED  but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute. They don't all have drumsticks. Some can be armed with HD cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters  or  as in this little bit of movie magic  quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons. Little robots are cute when they play music to you. When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you  a little bit less so. Of course  criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots. We know where that started. But they're adapting quickly. Recently  the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States  who was planning on using these remote controlled drone aircraft to fly C  explosives into government buildings in the United States. By the way  these travel at over     miles an hour. Every time a new technology is being introduced  criminals are there to exploit it. We've all seen  D printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete. With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day  a very cute little ducky. But I wonder to myself  for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up  how might they use  D printers  Perhaps like this. You see  if you can print in metal  you can print one of these  and in fact you can also print one of these too. The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws. You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. You just bring the  D printer and print the gun while you're here  and  of course  the magazines for your bullets. But as these get bigger in the future  what other items will you be able to print  The technologies are allowing bigger printers. As we move forward  we'll see new technologies also  like the Internet of Things. Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives to the Internet  which means that the Internet of Things will soon be the Internet of Things To Be Hacked. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies  and that has a radical implication for our security  because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code  you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked. That's troubling  since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology. As we've seen here  we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs. Every year  thousands of cochlear implants  diabetic pumps  pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. In the United States  there are        people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it. But if you don't need it  and somebody else gives you the shock  it's not a good thing. Of course  we're going to go even deeper than the human body. We're going down to the cellular level these days. Up until this point  all the technologies I've been talking about have been silicon based  ones and zeroes  but there's another operating system out there  the original operating system  DNA. And to hackers  DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. It's a great challenge for them. There are people already working on hacking the software of life  and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all  some won't be. So how will criminals abuse this  Well  with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things. For example  I predict that we will move away from a plant based narcotics world to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore  You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast  and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you  or the marijuana  or any other drug. So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting. In fact  we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century. The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously. It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace  but then in       something changed. The technologies got better  and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law. That has significant implications for us. It took us    years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today  but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly  and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do  we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future. It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio virus  enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax  weaponized flu. We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H N  avian influenza virus more potent. It already has a    percent mortality rate if you get it  but it's hard to get. Engineers  by moving around a small number of genetic changes  were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch  so that not thousands of people would die  but tens of millions. You see  you can go ahead and create new pandemics  and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments  they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information. But it goes deeper than that. DNA researcher Andrew Hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments  modern cancer treatments  to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact  then you can also go after any one person's cell. Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons  which means you can attack any one individual  including all the people in this picture. How will we protect them in the future  What to do  What to do about all this  That's what I get asked all the time. For those of you who follow me on Twitter  I will be tweeting out the answer later on today.  Laughter  Actually  it's a bit more complex than that  and there are no magic bullets. I don't have all the answers  but I know a few things. In the wake of       the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security. If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse    Laughter    uh  you may want to have a backup plan.  Laughter  Just saying. Just think about that.  Applause  Law enforcement is currently a closed system. It's nation based  while the threat is international. Policing doesn't scale globally. At least  it hasn't  and our current system of guns  border guards  big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats  like attacking a president or a prime minister  This would be the natural government response  to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles. But this is not going to work. The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial. Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future. So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this. What happens if we were to take the President's DNA  or a king or queen's  and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders  Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand  Or  controversially  and not without its risks  what happens if we just gave it to the whole public  Then we could all be engaged in helping. We've already seen examples of this working well. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world  and  in a more dramatic case  we've seen in Mexico  a country that has been racked by        narcotics related murders in the past six years. They're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez. What can we do about this  The government has proven ineffective. So in Mexico  citizens  at great risk to themselves  are fighting back to build an effective solution. They're crowd mapping the activities of the drug dealers. Whether or not you realize it  we are at the dawn of a technological arms race  an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious  and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that  rather than having a small  elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all  we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part  I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me  it's up to all of us. This was a technology I would frequently deploy as a police officer. This technology has become outdated in our current world. It doesn't scale  it doesn't work globally  and it surely doesn't work virtually. We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism. They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement. So I invite you to join me. After all  public safety is too important to leave to the professionals. Thank you.  Applause  My passions are music  technology and making things. And it's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization  and  on occasion  has led me to play with fire. This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years  and I have one here tonight. It's about an   foot long tube of metal  it's got a hundred or so holes on top  on that side is the speaker  and here is some lab tubing  and it's connected to this tank of propane. So  let's fire it up and see what it does. So let's play a     herz frequency and watch what happens. Thank you.  Applause  It's okay to applaud the laws of physics  but essentially what's happening here     Laughter     is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane  creating a visible waveform  and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency  and the height is showing us amplitude. So let's change the frequency of the sound  and watch what happens to the fire. So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire. So let's turn that off. We're indoors. Thank you.  Applause  I also have with me a flame table. It's very similar to a Rubens' tube  and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound  such as eigenmodes  so let's fire it up and see what it does. Ooh.  Laughter  Okay. Now  while the table comes up to pressure  let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions  and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line  and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane  and it can show a little more subtle complexity  which is why I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar. All right  so it's a delicate dance. If you watch closely    Applause  If you watch closely  you may have seen some of the eigenmodes  but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire. Actually  a lot of things are better with fire in my world  but the fire's just a foundation. It shows very well that eyes can hear  and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound  such as the removal of time. So here  I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song  Smells Like Teen Spirit  in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression  and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition. So if I show you another song off this album  and another  your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana  and in the frequency distribution  the colors  you can see the clean dirty clean sound that they are famous for  and here is the entire album as a single visual impression  and I think this impression is pretty powerful. At least  it's powerful enough that if I show you these four songs  and I remind you that this is  Smells Like Teen Spirit   you can probably correctly guess  without listening to any music at all  that the song a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song   I'll Stick Around  by the Foo Fighters  whose lead singer is Dave Grohl  who was the drummer in Nirvana. The songs are a little similar  but mostly I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks. All right  now for some more sound data. This is data from a skate park  and this is Mabel Davis skate park in Austin  Texas.  Skateboard sounds  And the sounds you're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park  and it sounds like chaos  but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap  but successful tricks end with a pop  whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble  and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong  and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park. So if we were to render these sounds visually  we might end up with something like this. This is all    minutes of the recording  and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made  and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer  and if you look really closely  we can tease out traffic patterns. You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier. And in the middle of the recording  the mics pick this up  but later in the recording  this kid shows up  and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail. And it's fascinating. At this moment in time  all the rest of the skaters turn their lines    degrees to stay out of his way. You see  there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park  and it's led by key influencers  and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks  or wear red pants  and on this day the mics picked that up. All right  from skate physics to theoretical physics. I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking  and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage. Now  in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer  which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm. It listens to the lecture  and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis  and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis. And these trend lines  you can see  there's more questions than answers in the laws of physics  and when we reach the end of a sentence  we place a star at that location. So there's a lot of sentences  so a lot of stars  and after rendering all of the audio  this is what we get. This is Stephen Hawking's universe. It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression  and I really like this image  but a lot of people think it's fake. So I made a more interactive version  and the way I did that is I used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into  D space  and with some custom software and a Kinect  I can walk right into the lecture. I'm going to wave through the Kinect here and take control  and now I'm going to reach out and I'm going to touch a star  and when I do  it will play the sentence that generated that star. Stephen Hawking  There is one  and only one  arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture. Jared Ficklin  Thank you.  Applause  There are       stars. It's a really fun way to explore the lecture  and  I hope  a fitting homage. All right. Let me close with a work in progress. I think  after    years  the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning. Now  we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online  so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on. There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song  and we're missing it  but if you've watched enough of these  you hear it in your mind's ear  and then applause starts. It usually begins here  and it grows and then it falls. Sometimes you get a little star applause  and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath  and the talk begins. All right  so let's watch this clip again. This time  I'm not going to talk at all. There's still going to be no audio  but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen. So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear. This is fairly amazing to me. Even on the first view  your eyes will successfully pick out patterns  but on repeated views  your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information. You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech  things that you can't get out of closed captioning. That famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see  and I believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all  and I speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences. I don't know. It's a theory right now. Actually  it's all just an idea. And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions  and so do ideas. Thank you.  Applause  Something happened in the early morning hours of May  nd        that had a profound effect on the way our society operates. Ironically  hardly anyone noticed at the time. The change was silent  imperceptible  unless you knew exactly what to look for. On that morning  U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System. Instantaneously  every civilian GPS receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room. It's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us. Before this switch was thrown  we didn't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions  because back then  GPS couldn't tell you what block you were on  let alone what street. For geolocation  accuracy matters  and things have only improved over the last    years. With more base stations  more ground stations  better receivers and better algorithms  GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on  but what part of the street. This level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation. In fact  many of you navigated here today with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone. Paper maps are becoming obsolete. But we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy. What if I told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting  For some time now  it's been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the GPS signal  and if you have an Internet connection  then you can go from meter level to centimeter level  even millimeter level positioning. So why don't we have this capability on our phones  Only  I believe  for a lack of imagination. Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap GPS chips because they're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand. But you and I and other innovators  we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy. Imagine  for example  an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world. I could build for you a structure up here in  D  millimeter accurate  that only you could see  or my friends at home. So this level of positioning  this is what we're looking for  and I believe that  within the next few years  I predict  that this kind of hyper precise  carrier phase based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous  and the consequences will be fantastic. The Holy Grail  of course  is the GPS dot. Do you remember the movie  The Da Vinci Code   Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot  which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe  but we know that in the world of nonfiction  the GPS dot is impossible  right  For one thing  GPS doesn't work indoors  and for another  they don't make devices quite this small  especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network. Well  these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago  but things have changed. There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization  better sensitivity  so much so that  a few years ago  a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys. Compare that with the device released just months ago that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob  and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete GPS receiver  which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever  you realize that the GPS dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction. Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots. It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore  or your child when you're at Disneyland. You'll buy GPS dots in bulk  and you'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars. I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning  and  as usual  had to ask my wife if she had seen them. But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality. I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are. Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail  remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it. The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions. Now  of course  there is a flip side to the GPS dot. I was in my office some months back and got a telephone call. The woman on the other end of the line  we'll call her Carol  was panicked. Apparently  an ex boyfriend of Carol's from California had found her in Texas and was following her around. So you might ask at this point why she's calling you. Well  so did I. But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case. Every time her ex boyfriend would show up  at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations  he was carrying an open laptop  and over time Carol realized that he had planted a GPS tracking device on her car  so she was calling me for help to disable it.  Well  you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car   I said.  I already have   she told me.  He didn't see anything obvious  and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece.   Well then  you'd better go to the police   I said.  I already have   she replied.  They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment  and they're not set up technically to find the device.   Okay  what about the FBI    I've talked to them too  and same story.  We then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car  but I wasn't even sure that would work  given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they're inside safe zones or when the car is moving. So  there we were. Carol isn't the first  and certainly won't be the last  to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment  worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking. In fact  as I looked into her case  I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car. The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking  but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another  so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about  but Big Neighbor.  Laughter  There is one alternative that Carol could have taken  very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble. It's an open source GPS jammer  developed by Limor Fried  a graduate student at MIT  and Limor calls it  a tool for reclaiming our personal space.  With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which GPS signals can't reside. They get drowned out by the bubble. And Limor designed this  in part  because  like Carol  she felt threatened by GPS tracking. Then she posted her design to the web  and if you don't have time to build your own  you can buy one. Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the Internet. So you might be thinking  the Wave Bubble sounds great. I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car. But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the United States. And why is that  Well  because it's not a bubble at all. Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car. They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you.  Laughter  Now  if you're Carol or Limor  or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking  it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble  but in fact  the results can be disastrous. Imagine  for example  you're the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble. All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank  and now it's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it. They    in fact  they don't update or upkeep lighthouses anymore  and LORAN  the only backup to GPS  was discontinued last year. Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS. We're almost blindly reliant on it. It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure. Some call it  the invisible utility.  So  turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience. It might be deadly. But as it turns out  for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general GPS reliability  there's something even more potent and more subversive than a Wave Bubble  and that is a GPS spoofer. The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple. Instead of jamming the GPS signals  you fake them. You imitate them  and if you do it right  the device you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed. So let me show you how this works. In any GPS receiver  there's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals. These three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak. But if you send in a fake GPS signal  another peak pops up  and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned  the tracking points can't tell the difference  and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal  with the authentic peak getting forced off. At this point  the game is over. The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver. So is this really possible  Can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver just like that  with a spoofer  Well  the short answer is yes. The key is that civil GPS signals are completely open. They have no encryption. They have no authentication. They're wide open  vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack. Even so  up until very recently  nobody worried about GPS spoofers. People figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one. But I  and a friend of mine from graduate school  we didn't see it that way. We knew it wasn't going to be so hard  and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against GPS spoofing. I remember vividly the week it all came together. We built it at my home  which means that I got a little extra help from my three year old son Ramon. Here's Ramon    Laughter    looking for a little attention from Dad that week. At first  the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers  though we eventually got it packaged into a small box. Now  the Dr. Frankenstein moment  when the spoofer finally came alive and I glimpsed its awful potential  came late one night when I tested the spoofer against my iPhone. Let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment. I had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo. They seemed to speak to me. They'd say   Here you are. Here you are.   Laughter  And  you can trust us.  So something felt very wrong about the world. It was a sense  almost  of betrayal  when this little blue dot started at my house  and went running off toward the north leaving me behind. I wasn't moving. What I then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos. I saw airplanes and ships veering off course  with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong. I saw the GPS derived timing of the New York Stock Exchange being manipulated by hackers. You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a GPS spoofer. There is  though  one redeeming feature of the GPS spoofer. It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots. Imagine  for example  you're being tracked. Well  you can play the tracker for a fool  pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation. Or  if you're Carol  you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him. So I'm fascinated by this conflict  a looming conflict  between privacy on the one hand and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other. We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers  and yet  given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot  can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on  for wanting to use them  I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of  some yet uninvented technology. But meanwhile  grab some popcorn  because things are going to get interesting. Within the next few years  many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot. Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them. You'll never lose track of your things again. The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life. But will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man  Or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble to protect your own privacy  So  as usual  what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril. It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out. Thanks.  Applause  I love to collect things. Ever since I was a kid  I've had massive collections of random stuff  everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars. Now  it's no secret  because I like collecting things  that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas. These  to me  are like living sculptures  right  that you can go and look at  and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life. So I was thinking about my own life  and how I'd like to memorialize my life  you know  for the ages  and also    Laughter    the lives of my friends  but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy ing them.  Laughter  So instead  I turned to video  and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time. So what I did was  I filmed six of my friends and then  using video mapping and video projection  I created a video sculpture  which was these six friends projected into jars.  Laughter  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go  and this is called Animalia Chordata  from the Latin nomenclature for human being  classification system. So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars  and they actually move around.  Laughter  So  this is interesting to me  but it lacked a certain human element.  Laughter  It's a digital sculpture  so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was  I added a proximity sensor  so that when you get close to the people in jars  they react to you in different ways. You know  just like people on the street when you get too close to them. Some people reacted in terror.  Laughter  Others reacted in asking you for help  and some people hide from you. So this was really interesting to me  this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life  and also adding interactivity to sculpture. So over the next year  I documented    of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as Garden  which is literally a garden of humanity. But something about the first piece  the Animali Chordata piece  kept coming back to me  this idea of interaction with art  and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact  and also being challenged by interacting with art. So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something  and the way I did this was actually by projecting a     s housewife into a blender.  Laughter  This is a piece called Blend  and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art. You may never experience the entire thing yourself. You can walk away  you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you  or you can actually choose to interact with it. So if you do choose to interact with the piece  and you press the blender button  it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment. By doing that  you are now part of my piece. You  like the people that are trapped in my work    Blender noises  laughter    have become part of my work as well.  Laughter  But  but this seems a bit unfair  right  I put my friends in jars  I put this character  this sort of endangered species character in a blender. But I'd never done anything about myself. I'd never really memorialized myself. So I decided to create a piece which is a self portrait piece. This is sort of a self portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed  in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock  and it's up to you. If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock  you actually age me. So I start as a baby  and then if you punch the clock  you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler  and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager. From a teenager  I'm transformed into my current self. From my current self  I'm turned into a middle aged man  and then  from there  into an elderly man. And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day  the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day. So  in doing so  you're erasing time. You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life. So I like this about interactive video sculpture  that you can actually interact with it  that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves  and hopefully  one day  I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  Now  I don't usually like cartoons  I don't think many of them are funny  I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker. So  the guy is telling the cat  don't you dare think outside the box. Well  I'm afraid I used to be the cat. I always wanted to be outside the box. And it's partly because I came to this field from a different background  chemist and a bacterial geneticist. So  what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer  sources of cancer  or  for that matter  why you are who you are  didn't make sense. So  let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it. So  to begin with  however  I have to give you a very  very quick lesson in developmental biology  with apologies to those of you who know some biology. So  when your mom and dad met  there is a fertilized egg  that round thing with that little blip. It grows and then it grows  and then it makes this handsome man. So  this guy  with all the cells in his body  all have the same genetic information. So how did his nose become his nose  his elbow his elbow  and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot  It could. It has the genetic information. You all remember  dolly  it came from a single mammary cell. So  why doesn't it do it  So  have a guess of how many cells he has in his body. Somewhere between    trillion to    trillion cells in his body. Trillion  Now  how did these cells  all with the same genetic material  make all those tissues  And so  the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies. Now  the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell  and it would make you a cancer victim. Well  this did not make sense to me. Do you even know how a trillion looks  Now  let's look at it. There it comes  these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes. Now  if .     of these cells got mutated  and .      got cancer  you will be a lump of cancer. You will have cancer all over you. And you're not. Why not  So  I decided over the years  because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture. And let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this. To begin with  I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken. Rous discovered this in     . It was the first cancer virus discovered  and when I call it  oncogene   meaning  cancer gene.  So  he made a filtrate  he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter  and he injected it to another chicken  and he got another tumor. So  scientists were very excited  and they said  a single oncogene can do it. All you need is a single oncogene. So  they put the cells in cultures  chicken cells  dumped the virus on it  and it would pile up  and they would say  this is malignant and this is normal. And again this didn't make sense to me. So for various reasons  we took this oncogene  attached it to a blue marker  and we injected it into the embryos. Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo. Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell  and they're part of the feather. So  when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish  we got a mass of blue cells. So  in the chicken you get a tumor  in the embryo you don't  you dissociate  you put it in a dish  you get another tumor. What does that mean  That means that microenvironment and the context which surrounds those cells actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do. Now  let's take a normal example. The normal example  let's take the human mammary gland. I work on breast cancer. So  here is a lovely human breast. And many of you know how it looks  except that inside that breast  there are all these pretty  developing  tree like structures. So  we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland  which is called an  acinus   where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes  and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks. And we said  wonderful  Look at this pretty structure. We want to make this a structure  and ask the question  how do the cells do that  So  we took the red cells    you see the red cells are surrounded by blue  other cells that squeeze them  and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert  and it was just having a structure to keep the shape  and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago  and you see this cell is actually quite pretty. It has a bottom  it has a top  it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk  because it just came from an early pregnant mouse. You take these cells  you put them in a dish  and within three days  they look like that. They completely forget. So you take them out  you put them in a dish  they don't make milk. They completely forget. For example  here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left  there is nothing on the right. Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left is in the animal  the one on the right is in a dish. They are completely different from each other. So  what does this tell you  This tells you that here also  context overrides. In different contexts  cells do different things. But how does context signal  So  Einstein said that  For an idea that does not first seem insane  there is no hope.  So  you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received    couldn't get money  couldn't do a whole lot of other things  but I'm so glad it all worked out. So  we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse  and all those lovely acini are there  every one of those with the red around them are an acinus  and we said okay  we are going to try and make this  and I said  maybe that red stuff around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold  maybe it has information  maybe it tells the cells what to do  maybe it tells the nucleus what to do. So I said  extracellular matrix  which is this stuff called ECM  signals and actually tells the cells what to do. So  we decided to make things that would look like that. We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it  we put the cells in it  and lo and behold  in about four days  they got reorganized and on the right  is what we can make in culture. On the left is what's inside the animal  we call it in vivo  and the one in culture was full of milk  the lovely red there is full of milk. So  we Got Milk  for the American audience. All right. And here is this beautiful human cell  and you can imagine that here also  context goes. So  what do we do now  I made a radical hypothesis. I said  if it's true that architecture is dominant  architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal. Could this be done  So  we tried it. In order to do that  however  we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant  and on the left is the single normal cell  human breast  put in three dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix  it makes all these beautiful structures. On the right  you see it looks very ugly  the cells continue to grow  the normal ones stop. And you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor. So we said  what is on the surface of these ugly tumors  Could we calm them down    they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up    and make them to the level of the normal  Well  it was wonderful. Boggles my mind. This is what we got. We can revert the malignant phenotype. And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype I didn't just choose one  here are little movies  sort of fuzzy  but you see that on the left are the malignant cells  all of them are malignant  we add one single inhibitor in the beginning  and look what happens  they all look like that. We inject them into the mouse  the ones on the right  and none of them would make tumors. We inject the other ones in the mouse      percent tumors. So  it's a new way of thinking about cancer  it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer. We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level  and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment. All right  thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally. And here is another five seconds of repose  is my mantra. Form and function. And of course  we now ask  where do we go now  We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic. But before we do that  I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there  in your    trillion cells  the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus  the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored. We have made a lot of discoveries  we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin. We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix. It has taken many years  but it has been very rewarding. And before I get to the next slide  I have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made. There is so much mystery we don't know. And I always say to the students and post docs I lecture to  don't be arrogant  because arrogance kills curiosity. Curiosity and passion. You need to always think  what else needs to be discovered  And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed. So  we have now made an amazing discovery  a post doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me  what do the cells do when you put them in  What do they do in the beginning when they do  I said  I don't know  we couldn't look at them. We didn't have high images in the old days. So she  being an imager and a physicist  did this incredible thing. This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions. Look at it. It's constantly doing this. Has a coherent movement. You put the cancer cells there  and they do go all over  they do this. They don't do this. And when we revert the cancer cell  it again does this. Absolutely boggles my mind. So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing. So I'd like to finish with a poem. Well I used to love English literature  and I debated in college  which one should I do  And unfortunately or fortunately  chemistry won. But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines. It's called  Among the School Children.   O body swayed to music   O brightening glance   How  can we know  the dancer from the dance   And here is Merce Cunningham  I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger  and here he is a dancer  and while he is dancing  he is both the dancer and the dance. The minute he stops  we have neither. So it's like form and function. Now  I'd like to show you a current picture of my group. I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant students and post docs who have taught me so much  and I have had many of these groups come and go. They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told  don't think outside the box. And I'd like to leave you with this thought. On the left is water coming through the shore  taken from a NASA satellite. On the right  there is a coral. Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away  on a dish it looks like that. Do they look the same  Do they have the same patterns  Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again  And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome  we know everything about the sequence of the gene  the language of the gene  the alphabet of the gene  But we know nothing  but nothing  about the language and alphabet of form. So  it's a wonderful new horizon  it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old  and that's me. So go to it  So let me start by taking you back  back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life  but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history  the year     . Remember that  Y K  the dotcom bubble  stressing about whose party you're going to go to as the clock strikes midnight  before the champagne goes flat  and then there's that inchoate yearning that was felt  I think  by many  that the millennium  that the year       should mean more  more than just a two and some zeroes. Well  amazingly  for once  our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in      agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff  visionary  measurable  long term targets called the Millennium Development Goals. Now  I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals under your pillow  or by the bedside table  but just in case you don't  and your memory needs some jogging  the deal agreed then goes like this  developing countries promised to at least halve extreme poverty  hunger and deaths from disease  alongside some other targets  by       and developed nations promised to help them get that done by dropping debts  increasing smart aid  and trade reform. Well  we're approaching       so we'd better assess  how are we doing on these goals  But we've also got to decide  do we like such global goals  Some people don't. And if we like them  we've got to decide what we want to do on these goals going forward. What does the world want to do together  We've got to decide a process by which we decide. Well  I definitely think these goals are worth building on and seeing through  and here's just a few reasons why. Incredible partnerships between the private sector  political leaders  philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world  but also         people marched in the streets of Edinburgh outside this very building for Make Poverty History. All together  they achieved these results  increased the number of people on anti retrovirals  life saving anti AIDS drugs  nearly halved deaths from malaria  vaccinated so many that  .  million lives will be saved. And combined  this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year  last year  than in the year     . That's       fewer kids dying every day  ten times you lot not dead every day  because of all of these partnerships. So I think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about  but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk. Anyway  for now  anyone involved in getting these results  thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it. But there's still a lot of unfinished business. Still   .  million children die every year of preventable  treatable diseases  and     million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting  a horrible term which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment. So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got. But then  a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included  like sustainable development targets  natural resource governance targets  access to opportunity  to knowledge  equity  fighting corruption. All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals. But the key thing here is  what do you think should be in the new goals  What do you want  Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality or education  Should those be in the new package of goals  And quite frankly  that's a good question  but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here  so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be legitimate  right  Well  as we gather here in Edinburgh  technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments  with the best intentions  are busying themselves designing a new package of goals  and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old late   th century  top down  elite  closed process. But  of course  since then  the Web and mobile telephony  along with ubiquitous reality TV formats have spread all around the world. So what we'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first  the world's first truly global poll and consultation  where everyone everywhere has an equal voice for the very first time. I mean  wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this  given that we can  There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake  tens of millions of lives  or deaths  at stake  and  I'd argue  the security and future of you and your family is also at stake. So  if you're with me  I'd say there's three essential steps in this crowdsourcing campaign  collecting  connecting and committing. So first of all  we've got to ground this campaign in core polling data. Let's go into every country that will let us in  ask       people what they want the new goals to be  making special efforts to reach the poorest  those without access to modern technology  and let's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward. Then  we've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward. The original goals didn't really have good baseline survey data  and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure we can really monitor the progress. And then we've got to connect with the big crowd. Now here  we see the role for an unprecedented coalition of social media giants and upstarts  telecoms companies  reality TV show formats  gaming companies  telecoms  all of them together in kind of their  We Are The World  moment. Could they come together and help the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded into the Millennial Generation's Goals  And if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment  and that comment turned into a commitment  we could crowdsource a force of     million people around the world to help see these goals through. If we have this collected data  and this connected crowd  based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit  I think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations. But the question really is  through this process will we all have become committed  And if we are  are we ready to iterate  monitor and provide feedback  make sure these promises are really delivering results  Well  there's some fantastic examples here to scale up  mostly piloted within Africa  actually. There's Open Data Kenya  which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are  are they delivering results. Often  they're not in the right place. And Ushahidi  which means  witness  in Swahili  which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses. This is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy  where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid. This openness  this forcing openness  is key  and if it wasn't entirely transparent already  I should be open  I've got a completely transparent agenda. Long term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live  with population increases  consumption patterns increasing  and conflict over scarce natural resources. And look at the state of global politics today. Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week  or the Mexican G    also last week. Both  if we're honest  a bust. Our world leaders  our global politics  currently can't get it done. They need our help. They need the cavalry  and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars. It's got to come from us  and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the   st century. I started in     . Let me finish in     . Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago we had called Make Poverty History. It was a naive thought in many people's minds  and it's true  it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the moment. But look. The empirical condition of living under a dollar and    is trending down  and look where it gets to by     . It's getting near zero. Now sure  progress in China and India and poverty reduction there was key to that  but recently also in Africa  poverty rates are being reduced. It will get harder as we get towards zero  as the poor will be increasingly located in post conflict  fragile states  or maybe in middle income states where they don't really care about the marginalized. But I'm confident  with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one  I think we can get this and other goals done. Thank you.  Applause  Chris Anderson  Jamie  here's the puzzle to me. If there was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where  say  a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces  I mean  it would be all over the news for a week  right  You just put up  just as one of your numbers there  that          is that the number  Jamie Drummond  Fewer children every day. CA  Five thousand fewer children dying every day. I mean  it dwarfs  dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda  and it's invisible. This must drive you crazy. JD  It does  and we're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels  for example  and aid alone is not the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is. But  you know  if people saw the results of this smart aid  I mean  they'd be going crazy for it. I wish the         people who really did march outside this very building knew these results. Right now they don't  and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it  because we have not. Creatively  we've failed to communicate this success so far. If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments  I know for a fact we'd get better policy. The Mexican G   need not have been a bust. Rio  if anyone cares about the environment  need not have been a bust  okay  But these conferences are going on  and I know people get skeptical and cynical about the big global summits and the promises and their never being kept  but actually  the bits that are  are making a difference  and what the politicians need is more permission from the public. CA  But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms  etc. by which this might happen. I mean  if the people here who've had experience using open platforms  you're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this forward. JD  Absolutely. CA  All right  well I must say  if this conference led in some way to advancing that idea  that's a huge idea  and if you carry that forward  that is really awesome  so thank you. JD  I'd love your help. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to start on a slightly somber note. Two thousand and seven  five years ago  my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer. Stage IIB. Now  looking back  the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits    these were very painful for my wife  understandably so. It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer at just    years old  absolutely no history of cancer in her family. The most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us. Should it be a mastectomy  Should it be a lumpectomy  Should it be a more aggressive form of treatment  given that it was stage IIB  With all the side effects  Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment  And these were being thrust upon us by the doctors. Now you could ask this question  why were the doctors doing this  A simplistic answer would be  the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally. I think that is too simplistic. These are well meaning doctors  some of them have gone on to become very good friends. They probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down through the ages  this adage that when you're making decisions  especially decisions of importance  it's best to be in charge  it's best to be in control  it's best to be in the driver's seat. And we were certainly in the driver's seat  making all these decisions. And let me tell you    if some of you have been there  it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience. Which got me thinking. I said  is there any validity to this whole adage that when you're making decisions  it's best to take the driver's seat  be in charge  be in control  Or are there contexts where we're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive  For example  a trusted financial advisor  could be a trusted doctor  etc. And since I study human decision making  I said  I'm going to run some studies to find some answers. And I'm going to share one of these studies with you today. So  imagine that all of you are participants in the study. I want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is  you're going to drink a cup of tea. If you're wondering why  I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now. You are going to solve a series of puzzles  and I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily. And the more puzzles you solve  the greater the chances that you'll win some prizes. Now  why do you have to consume the tea  Why  Because it makes a lot of sense  In order to solve these puzzles effectively  if you think about it  your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously  right  It needs to be alert  for which caffeine is very good. Simultaneously  it needs to be calm    not agitated  calm    for which chamomile is very good. Now comes the between subjects design  the AB design  the AB testing. So what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups. So imagine that there is an imaginary line out here  so everyone here will be group A  everyone out here will be group B. Now  for you folks  what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas  and I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea. So you can choose whichever tea you want. You can decide  what is your mental state  OK  I choose the caffeinated tea  I choose the chamomile tea. So you're going to be in charge  you're going to be in control  you're going to be in the driver's seat. You folks  I'm going to show you these two teas  but you don't have a choice. I'm going to give you one of these two teas  and keep in mind  I'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you. And you know that. So if you think about it  this is an extreme case scenario  because in the real world  whenever you are taking passenger's seat  very often the driver is going to be someone you trust  an expert  etc. So this is an extreme case scenario. Now  you're all going to consume the tea. So imagine that you're taking the tea now  we'll wait for you to finish the tea. We'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects. Now you're going to have    minutes to solve    puzzles. Here's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve. Anyone in the audience want to take a stab  Audience member  Pulpit  Baba Shiv  Whoa  OK. That's cool. Yeah  so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer as a participant  we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise. Because we want these puzzles to be difficult. These are tricky puzzles  because your first instinct is to say  tulip.  And then you have to unstick yourself. Right  So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise  because we want this to be difficult  and I'll tell you why  momentarily. Now  here's another example. Anyone  This is much more difficult. Audience member  Embark. BS  Yeah. Wow  OK. So  yeah  so this is  again  difficult. You'll say  kamber   then you'll go   maker   and all that  and then you can unstick yourself. So you have    minutes now to solve these    puzzles. Now  the question we're asking here is  in terms of the outcome    and it comes in the number of puzzles solved    will you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles because you are in control  you could decide which tea you would choose  or would you be better off  in terms of the number of puzzles solved  And  systemically  what we will show  across a series of studies  is that you  the passengers  even though the tea was picked for you at random  will end up solving more puzzles than you  the drivers. We also observe another thing  and that is  you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles  you're also putting less juice into the task    less effort  you're less persistent  and so on. How do we know that  Well  we have two objective measures. One is  what is the time  on average  you're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles  You will spend less time compared to you. Second  you have    minutes to solve these  are you taking the entire    minutes or are you giving up before the    minutes elapse  You will be more likely to give up before the    minutes elapse  compared to you. So you're putting in less juice  and therefore  the outcome  fewer puzzles solved. That brings us now to  why does this happen  And under what situations    when    would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better  more favorable outcomes  compared to the driver  It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA. It's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting after you made the decision. So if you think about it  in this particular puzzle task    it could happen in investing in the stock market  very volatile out there  it could be the medical situation    the feedback here is immediate. You know the feedback  whether you're solving the puzzles or not. Right  Second  it is negative. Remember  the deck was stacked against you  in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles. And this can happen in the medical domain. For example  very early on in the treatment  things are negative  the feedback  before things become positive. Right  It can happen in the stock market. Volatile stock market  getting negative feedback  it is also immediate. And the feedback in all these cases is concrete  it's unambiguous  you know if you've solved the puzzles or not. Now  the added one  apart from this immediacy  negative  this concreteness    now you have a sense of agency. You were responsible for your decision. So what do you do  You focus on the foregone option. You say  you know what  I should have chosen the other tea. That casts your decision in doubt  reduces the confidence you have in the decision  the confidence you have in the performance  the performance in terms of solving the puzzles. And therefore less juice into the task  fewer puzzles solved and less favorable outcomes compared to you folks. And this can happen in the medical domain  if you think about it  right  A patient in the driver's seat  for example. Less juice  which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit  physically active to hasten the recovery process  which is what is often advocated. You probably wouldn't do that. And therefore  there are times when you're facing the INCA  when the feedback is going to be immediate  negative  concrete and you have the sense of agency  where you're far better off taking the passenger's seat and have someone else drive. Now  I started off on a somber note. I want to finish up on a more upbeat note. It has now been five years  slightly more than five years  and the good news  thank God  is that the cancer is still in remission. So it all ends well. But one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment  my wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat. And that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that  we could focus on her recovery. We let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver's seat. Thank you. So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do  as we're walking around being able to point a phone at anything  and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain  and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas. Well  traditionally that was seen as science fiction  but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible. So the best way of explaining it is to just show it. What you can see over here is Tamara  who is holding my phone that's now plugged in. So let me start with this. What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns  and it's just a normal image  but if we now switch inputs over to the phone  running our technology  you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen  and when she points at this image  something magical happens. Voice  Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ... Matt Mills  Now  what's great about this is  there's no trickery here. There's nothing done to this image. And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does. Not only that  but as I move the object around  it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly. Again  the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become. All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself. Now  this has applications everywhere  whether in things like art in museums  like you just saw  or in the world of  say  advertising  or print journalism. So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed. And here is this morning's newspaper  and we have some Wimbledon news  which is great. Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin. Voice  ... To the grass  and it's very important that you adapt and you  you have to be flexible  you have to be willing to change direction at a split second  and she does all that. She's won this title. MM  And that linking of the digital content to something that's physical is what we call an aura  and I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk. So  what's great about this is it isn't just a faster  more convenient way to get information in the real world  but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible. So what I have here is a wireless router. My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router  so that everyone here understands    Laughter    but nonetheless  here is the device. So now what I can do is  rather than getting the instructions for the device online  I can simply point at it  the device is recognized  and then    Voice  Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable. Then connect the power. Finally  the yellow ethernet cable. Congratulations. You have now completed setup. The incredible work that made that possible was done here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge  and they work in our offices  and I've got a lovely picture of them here. They couldn't all be on stage  but we're going to bring their aura to the stage  so here they are. They're not very animated.  Laughter  This was the fourth take  I'm told.  Laughter  Okay. So  as we're talking about Cambridge  let's now move on to technical advancements  because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than    months ago  the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate  and that means that I can now take cinema quality  D models and place them in the world around me  so I have one over here. Tamara  would you like to jump in  MM  I should leap in. So then  after the fun  comes the more emotional side of what we do  because effectively  this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes  and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world. What's great about this is  the tools to do this are free. They're open  they're available to everyone within our application  and educators have really got on board with the classrooms. So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks  teachers who've tagged up school classrooms  and a great example of this is a school in the U.K. I have a picture here from a video  and we're now going to play it. Teacher  See what happens.  Children talking  Keep going. Child  TV.  Children react  Child  Oh my God. Teacher  Now move it either side. See what happens. Move away from it and come back to it. Child  Oh  that is so cool. Teacher  And then  have you got it again  Child  Oh my God  How did you do that  Second child  It's magic. It's available for everyone to do  and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now. So  as sort of   I'm told it's called a stadium wave  so we're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three  and go over to here. Tamara  are you recording  Okay  so are you all ready  One  two  three. Go  Audience  Whooooooo  MM  Fellows are really good at that.  Laughs   Laughter  Okay. Now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma application  and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge  so that I can remember it forever. Now  we have lots of people who are doing this already  and we've talked a little bit about the educational side. On the emotional side  we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them. We have people who have  for example  taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine  so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more  you can point and discover the information. We're all very  very familiar with the Internet. In the last    years  it's really changed the way that we live and work  and the way that we see the world  and what's great is  we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift  because now we can literally take the content that we share  we discover  and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us. It's completely free to download this application. If you have a good Wi Fi connection or  G  this process is very  very quick. Oh  there we are. We can save it now. It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint  and the great thing is  if you're a professional user     so  a newspaper    the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration. The only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready  Tamara Roukaerts  We're ready to go. MM  Okay. So  I'm told we're ready  which means we can now point at the image  and there you all are. MM on video  One  two  three. Go  MM  Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you. Well  I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia  which is total color blindness  so I've never seen color  and I don't know what color looks like  because I come from a grayscale world. To me  the sky is always gray  flowers are always gray  and television is still in black and white. But  since the age of     instead of seeing color  I can hear color. In       I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon  and the result  with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona  is this electronic eye. It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me    Frequency sounds    and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head  and I hear the color in front of me through the bone  through bone conduction. This is the sound of purple.  Frequency sounds  For example  this is the sound of grass.  Frequency sounds  This is red  like TED.  Frequency sounds  This is the sound of a dirty sock.  Laughter  Which is like yellow  this one. So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years  since       so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time. At the start  though  I had to memorize the names you give for each color  so I had to memorize the notes  but after some time  all this information became a perception. I didn't have to think about the notes. And after some time  this perception became a feeling. I started to have favorite colors  and I started to dream in colors. So  when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united  because in my dreams  it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software  so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg. It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device. It had become a part of my body  an extension of my senses  and after some time  it even became a part of my official image. This is my passport from     . You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment  but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body  an extension of my brain  and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo. So  life has changed dramatically since I hear color  because color is almost everywhere  so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery  I can listen to a Picasso  for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall  because I can listen to the paintings. And supermarkets  I find this is very shocking  it's very  very attractive to walk along a supermarket. It's like going to a nightclub. It's full of different melodies.  Laughter  Yeah. Especially the aisle with cleaning products. It's just fabulous.  Laughter  Also  the way I dress has changed. Before  I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.  Laughter  So today I'm dressed in C major  so it's quite a happy chord.  Laughter  If I had to go to a funeral  though  I would dress in B minor  which would be turquoise  purple and orange.  Laughter  Also  food  the way I look at food has changed  because now I can display the food on a plate  so I can eat my favorite song.  Laughter  So depending on how I display it  I can hear and I can compose music with food. So imagine a restaurant where we can have  like  Lady Gaga salads as starters.  Laughter  I mean  this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables  probably. And also  some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes  and some Bjork or Madonna desserts  that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs. Also  the way I perceive beauty has changed  because when I look at someone  I hear their face  so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible. the other way around. So I really enjoy creating  like  sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing someone's face  like drawing the shape  I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear  and then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces. Yeah  Nicole Kidman sounds good.  Laughter  Some people  I would never relate  but they sound similar. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes. So you relate people that you wouldn't relate  and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces. So I connect the eye  and then I play the audience's faces. The good thing about this is  if the concert doesn't sound good  it's their fault. It's not my fault  because    Laughter  And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color. I heard a telephone tone  and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps  they sound turquoise  and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience  so I started to paint music and paint people's voices  because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. And here's some music translated into color. For example  Mozart   Queen of the Night   looks like this. because there's many different frequencies. And this is a completely different song. It is very pink and very yellow. So  also voices  I can transform speeches into color  for example  these are two very well known speeches. One of them is Martin Luther King's  I Have A Dream   and the other one is Hitler. And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels  and then I ask people   Which one do you prefer   And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King. So I got to a point when I was able to perceive     colors  just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel. But then  I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many  many more colors around us that we cannot perceive  but that electronic eyes can perceive. So I decided to continue extending my color senses  and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color to sound scale  so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example  perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe  because ultraviolet is a dangerous color  a color that can actually kill us  so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive. That's why  two years ago  I created the Cyborg Foundation  which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg  tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses  so if we extend our senses  we will consequently extend our knowledge. I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body. I think this will be a big  big change that we will see during this century. So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend. I would encourage you to become a cyborg. You won't be alone. Thank you.  Applause  So the machine I'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was. It was a machine that was never built  and yet  it will be built. It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers. If you know anything about the history of computers  you will know that in the '  s and the '  s  simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today  and you would be correct  except for you'd have the wrong century. The first computer was really designed in the     s and     s  not the     s and     s. It was designed  and parts of it were prototyped  and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington. That machine was built by this guy  Charles Babbage. Now  I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture.  Laughter  He was a very wealthy man  and a sort of  part of the aristocracy of Britain  and on a Saturday night in Marylebone  were you part of the intelligentsia of that period  you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree   and he invited everybody  kings  the Duke of Wellington  many  many famous people   and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines. I really miss that era  you know  where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you.  Laughter  But Babbage  Babbage himself was born at the end of the   th century  and was a fairly famous mathematician. He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge  and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking. He's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them. The reason he never made any of them  he's a classic nerd. Every time he had a good idea  he'd think   That's brilliant  I'm going to start building that one. I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea. I'm going to work on this one.  Laughter  And I'm going to do this one.  He did this until Sir Robert Peel  then Prime Minister  basically kicked him out of Number    Downing Street  and kicking him out  in those days  that meant saying   I bid you good day  sir.   Laughter  The thing he designed was this monstrosity here  the analytical engine. Now  just to give you an idea of this  this is a view from above. Every one of these circles is a cog  a stack of cogs  and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive. So as I go through this talk  I want you to imagine this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like. And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine   that's why it's computer architecture   and tell you about this machine  which is a computer. So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today  except it was all made out of metal  stacks and stacks of cogs     cogs high. Imagine a thing this high of cogs  hundreds and hundreds of them  and they've got numbers on them. It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal. And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall  it would have been ridiculous. As it is  it's enormous. So he's got memory. The memory is this bit over here. You see it all like this. This monstrosity over here is the CPU  the chip  if you like. Of course  it's this big. Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical. This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum. The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic    so addition  multiplication  subtraction  division    which already is a bit of a feat in metal  but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't  this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision. It could do the  if then  for basic programmers  and that fundamentally made it into a computer. It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more. Now  if we look at this  and we stop for a minute  and we think about chips today  we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny. Yet if you did  you would see something very  very similar to this. There's this incredible complexity in the CPU  and this incredible regularity in the memory. If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture  you'll see this. This all looks the same  then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated. All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does  but of course you need to program this thing  and of course  Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '  s  '  s and '  s  which is punch cards. This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here  and this is a program in the Science Museum  just not far from here  created by Charles Babbage  that is sitting there   you can go see it   waiting for the machine to be built. And there's not just one of these  there's many of them. He prepared programs anticipating this would happen. Now  the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard  in France  had created the Jacquard loom  which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards  so he was just repurposing the technology of the day  and like everything else he did  he's using the technology of his era  so     s      s      s  cogs  steam  mechanical devices. Ironically  born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday  who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo  transformers  all these sorts of things. Babbage  of course  wanted to use proven technology  so steam and things. Now  he needed accessories. Obviously  you've got a computer now. You've got punch cards  a CPU and memory. You need accessories you're going to come with. You're not just going to have that  So  first of all  you had sound. You had a bell  so if anything went wrong    Laughter    or the machine needed the attendant to come to it  there was a bell it could ring.  Laughter  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says  Ring the bell.  So you can imagine this  Ting   You know  just stop for a moment  imagine all those noises  this thing   Click  clack click click click   steam engine   Ding   right   Laughter  You also need a printer  obviously  and everyone needs a printer. This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his  called the Difference Engine No.    which he never built  but which the Science Museum did build in the '  s and '  s. It's completely mechanical  again  a printer. It prints just numbers  because he was obsessed with numbers  but it does print onto paper  and it even does word wrapping  so if you get to the end of the line  it goes around like that. You also need graphics  right  I mean  if you're going to do anything with graphics  so he said   Well  I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I'll make it plot.  So he designed a plotter as well  and  you know  at that point  I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine. Along comes this woman  Ada Lovelace. Now  imagine these soirees  all these great and good comes along. This lady is the daughter of the mad  bad and dangerous to know Lord Byron  and her mother  being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness  thought   I know the solution  Mathematics is the solution. We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down.  there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy  so  you know  that'll be fine.  Laughter  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training  and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother  and Charles Babbage  you know  gets out his machine. The Duke of Wellington is there  you know  get out the machine  obviously demonstrates it  and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime  really  who said   I understand what this does  and I understand the future of this machine.  And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her. Now  some people call her the first programmer. This is actually from one of    the paper that she translated. This is a program written in a particular style. It's not  historically  totally accurate that she's the first programmer  and actually  she did something more amazing. Rather than just being a programmer  she saw something that Babbage didn't. Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics. He was building a machine to do mathematics  and Lovelace said   You could do more than mathematics on this machine.  And just as you do  everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now  because they've got a phone. If you go into that phone  every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom. Whether it's video or text or music or voice  it's all numbers  it's all  underlying it  mathematical functions happening  and Lovelace said   Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world  such as music.  This was a huge leap  because Babbage is there saying   We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs      Laughter    and Lovelace is there and she says   Look  this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically.  So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap. When you say she's a programmer  she did do some  but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much  much more than this. Now  a hundred years later  this guy comes along  Alan Turing  and in       and invents the computer all over again. Now  of course  Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical. Turing's machine was entirely theoretical. Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective  but Turing told us something very important. He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science  and said   It doesn't matter how you make a computer.  It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical  like Babbage's was  or electronic  like computers are today  or perhaps in the future  cells  or  again  mechanical again  once we get into nanotechnology. We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers. There is in a sense a computing essence. This is called the Church Turing thesis. And so suddenly  you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer. In fact  it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers  only really slowly.  Laughter  To give you an idea of how slowly  it had about  k of memory. It used punch cards  which were being fed in  and it ran about        times slower the first ZX  . It did have a RAM pack. You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to. So there are plans. Over in Swindon  the Science Museum archives  there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine. One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan     and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade  who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum  and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine  and our plan is to build it. Here in South Kensington  we will build the analytical engine. The project has a number of parts to it. One was the scanning of Babbage's archive. That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build. The third part is a computer simulation of that machine  and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum. When it's built  you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works  because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you  you've got to look at this humongous thing and say   Ah  I see the memory operating  I see the CPU operating  I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating.   Laughter  But in between that we're going to do a simulation. Babbage himself wrote  he said  as soon as the analytical engine exists  it will surely guide the future course of science. Of course  he never built it  because he was always fiddling with new plans  but when it did get built  of course  in the     s  everything changed. Now  I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working. So this is just three sets of cogs  and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism in action  so you imagine this gigantic machine. So  give me five years. Before the     s happen  we'll have it. Thank you very much.  Applause  Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society. That's what we're after. And we do this because we actually believe that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess. It's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have  while about two thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life  including health care  education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues. So before I start  I want to talk about a little anecdote  a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai. So this man  his name is Sathi Shri. He is an outstanding person  because he's a small entrepreneur. He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai. He has this little    square meter store  where so much is being done. It's incredible  because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once just happened to bump into him. Basically  what he does is  he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for  but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world. More importantly  he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons  you know  for the prepaid subscriptions. But then  in the backside  he's got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything. Any cell phone  any gadget you can bring them  they can fix it. And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there  and he was like   Yeah  do you want an upgrade    Yes.   Laughter  I was a bit skeptical  but then  I decided to give him a Nokia instead.  Laughter  But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know how that's built into this little two meters of space. They have figured out everything that's required to dismantle  take things apart  rewrite the circuitry  re flash the firmware  do whatever you want to with the phone  and they can fix anything so quickly. You can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch  and it was quite incredible. But then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon  or is truly global  And  over time  we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about  because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. It's actually happening in all parts of the country. It's even happening in Africa  like  for example  in Cape Town we did extensive research on this. Even here in Doha I found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed  and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy. You've got to try it on your own to believe it. But what fuels this  It's this entire ecosystem of low cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world  literally  and then redistributed to basically service this industry  and you can even buy salvaged parts. Basically  you don't have to necessarily buy brand new things. You have condemned computers that are stripped apart  and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration. But what does this new  sort of  approach give us  That's the real question  because this is something that's been there  part of every society that's deprived of enough resources. But there's an interesting paradigm. There's the traditional crafts  and then there's the technology crafts. We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. They're not something that's been established. It's not something that's institutionalized. It's not taught in universities. It's taught  by  word of mouth  and it's an informal education system around this. So we said   What can we get out of this  You know  like  what are the key values that we can get out of this   The main thing is a fix it locally culture  which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed. It also affords us cheap fabrication  which is fantastic  so it means that you can do a lot more with it. And then  the most important thing is  it gives us large math for low cost. So it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices. So  what we call this is a silicon cottage industry. It's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops across the planet in most developing countries. So  we kind of toyed around with this idea  and we said   What can we do with this  Can we make a little product or a service out of it   So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box. Basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of India. So there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school  which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. It's an informal school  but it's really about holistic education. The only thing that they don't have is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook sometimes  and they don't even have a proper curriculum. So we said   What can we do to empower this teacher to do more   How to access the digital world  Instead of being the sole guardian of information  be a facilitator to all this information. So we said   What are the steps required to empower the teacher   How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway  and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally   So we walked around. We went and scavenged the nearby markets  and we tried to understand   What can we pick up that will make this happen   So the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about    dollars. We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery  and a bunch of small speakers. So essentially  the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform. It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them. The flashlight gives us this really intense  bright L.E.D.  and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack  and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside  and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough. Believe me  those little classrooms are really noisy. They are kids who scream at the top of their voices  and you really have to get above that. And we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop  and then the magic happens. We dismantle the whole thing  we reassemble it in a new configuration  and we do this hardware mashup  systematically training the guy how to do this. Out comes this  a little lunch box    form factor. And we systematically field tested  because in the field testing we learned some important lessons  and we went through many iterations. One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging. Luminosity was an issue  when you have too much bright sunlight outside. Often the roofs are broken  so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things. We extended this idea. We tested it many times over  and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy  but most importantly connect to a car battery  because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there's not enough electricity or erratic electricity. And the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a USB key  because we realized that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper  at least  in theory  it was much more efficient to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail. It might take a few days to get there  but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality. So we made this box  and we tested it again and again and again  and we're going through multiple iterations to do these things. But it's not limited to just education. This kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas  and I'm going to tell you one more little story. It's about this little device called a medi meter. It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed. In India  there is a context of these amazing people  the health care workers called ASHA workers. They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained with basic tools and basic concepts of health care  and the main purpose is basically to inform people to basically  how to lead a better life  but also to divert or sort of make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach  They are basically referral services  essentially. But the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system  but what happens at the public health care system is this  these incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that's being referred. So everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention  and there's no priorities. So we said   Come on  there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure.  So we said   What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter  but not just a filter  a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network  and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations   So the real key question was  how do we empower this woman  How do we empower her with simple tools that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better  And that'll make such a huge difference on the system  because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel  often sometimes seven to    kilometers  sometimes by foot  to get a simple health check done  is very  very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. So if there was something that she could do  that would be amazing. So what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device. I want to demo this actually  because it's a very simple process. Bruno  do you want to join us   Cheers  Come along.  Applause  So  what we're going to do is that we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you  including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that's there in your blood. So you're going to put your thumb on top of this. Bruno Giussani  Like this  works  Vinay Venkatraman  Yeah. That's right. BG  Okay. VV  So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works. So ...  Laughter  So I take it into the start position  and then I press the read button.  Beeps  So it's taking a little reading from you.  Beeps  And then the pointer goes and points to three different options. Let's see what happens here. BG  Great. Good news.  Applause  VV  So ...  Applause  So the thing about this is that if the pointer  unfortunately  had pointed to the red spot  we would have to rush you to a hospital. Luckily  not today. And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber  it basically meant you had to have  sort of  more continuous care from the health care worker. So that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works in so many different ways. BG  Thank you for the good news. VV  Yeah. So  very briefly  I'll just explain to you how this is done  because that's the more interesting part. So essentially  the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today  some parts from a computer mouse  basically  something that you can scavenge for very low cost  and a few parts that have to be pre programmed. Basically this is a micro controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world  and that's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else. So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker. We are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see if there's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people's lives. But most importantly  what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up  because there are over         ASHA workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers  and if we can give at least a fraction of them the access to these things  it just changes the way the economics of public health care works  and it changes the way systems actually function  not just on a systematic planning level  but also in a very grassroots  bottom up level. So that's it  and we hope to do this in a big way. Thank you.  Applause  I'm gonna talk a little bit about open source security  because we've got to get better at security in this   st century. Let me start by saying  let's look back to the   th century  and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us. This is Verdun  a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium. At Verdun  in       over a     day period          people were killed  so about       a day. If you roll it forward      th century security    into the Second World War  you see the Battle of Stalingrad      days    million people killed. We go into the Cold War  and we continue to try and build walls. We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War  and then we go into the Cold War  the Iron Curtain  the Berlin Wall. Walls don't work. My thesis for us today is  instead of building walls to create security  we need to build bridges. This is a famous bridge in Europe. It's in Bosnia Herzegovina. It's the bridge over the Drina River  the subject of a novel by Ivo Andri   and it talks about how  in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans  over time there's been enormous building of walls. More recently  in the last decade  we begin to see these communities start  hesitatingly  to come together. I would argue  again  open source security is about connecting the international  the interagency  the private public  and lashing it together with strategic communication  largely in social networks. So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that  because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways  and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls. Now  I'm a sailor  obviously. This is a ship  a liner  clipping through the Indian Ocean. What's wrong with this picture  It's got concertina wire along the sides of it. That's to prevent pirates from attacking it. Piracy is a very active threat today around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean. Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca. It's active in the Gulf of Guinea. We see it in the Caribbean. It's a     billion a year discontinuity in the global transport system. Last year  at this time  there were    vessels      mariners held hostage. This is an attack on the global commons. We need to think about how to address it. Let's shift to a different kind of sea  the cyber sea. Here are photographs of two young men. At the moment  they're incarcerated. They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over    billion dollars. This is part of cybercrime which is a    trillion a year discontinuity in the global economy. Two trillion a year. That's just under the GDP of Great Britain. So this cyber sea  which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness  is very much under threat as well. Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking  by the movement of narcotics  opium  here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States. We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge north. We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking. Above all  perhaps  we worry about human trafficking  and the awful cost of it. Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons. This is a photograph  and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high tech piece of US Navy gear that we're using to stop the trafficking. The bad news is  this is a semi submersible run by drug cartels. It was built in the jungles of South America. We caught it with that low tech raft    Laughter    and it was carrying six tons of cocaine. Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep. This kind of trafficking  in narcotics  in humans  in weapons  God forbid  in weapons of mass destruction  is part of the threat to the global commons. And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today. This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan. Eighty to    percent of the world's poppy  opium and heroin  comes out of Afghanistan. We also see there  of course  terrorism. This is where al Qaeda is staged from. We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there. So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons  and what we must address. So here we are    st century. We know our   th century tools are not going to work. What should we do  I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun. We will need the application of military force. When we do it  we must do it well  and competently. But my thesis is  open source security is about international  interagency  private public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet. Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way. This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers. They are all holding books. You should say   That's odd. I thought I read that this demographic  young men and women in their   s and   s  is largely illiterate in Afghanistan.  You would be correct. Eighty five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan. Why  Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read. So the question is  so  why are they all standing there holding books  The answer is  we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities  in partnership with development agencies. We've taught well over         Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level. When you can read and write in Afghanistan  you will typically put a pen in your pocket. At the ceremonies  when these young men and women graduate  they take that pen with great pride  and put it in their pocket. This is bringing together international   there are    nations involved in this mission   interagency   these development agencies   and private public  to take on this kind of security. Now  we are also teaching them combat skills  of course  but I would argue  open source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect. Here's another example. This is a US Navy warship. It's called the Comfort. There's a sister ship called the Mercy. They are hospital ships. This one  the Comfort  operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments. On a typical cruise  they'll do         patient treatments. It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations  Operation Hope  Project Smile. Other organizations send volunteers. Interagency physicians come out. They're all part of this. To give you one example of the impact this can have  this little boy  eight years old  walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort. When he was fitted  over his extremely myopic eyes  he suddenly looked up and said   Mama  veo el mundo.   Mom  I see the world.  Multiply this by         patient treatments  this private public collaboration with security forces  and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way. Here you see baseball players. Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers in this photograph  They are the two young men on either side of these young boys. This is part of a series of baseball clinics  where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball  the Department of State  who sets up the diplomatic piece of this  military baseball players  who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission  and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean  in Honduras  in Nicaragua  in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular  and it creates security. It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us. Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief. This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in      which killed         people. In each of these major disasters   the tsunami in               dead  the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan               dead  the Haitian earthquake  about         dead  more recently the awful earthquake tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry   in all of these instances  we see partnerships between international actors  interagency  private public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster. So these are examples of this idea of open source security. We tie it together  increasingly  by doing things like this. Now  you're looking at this thinking   Ah  Admiral  these must be sea lanes of communication  or these might be fiber optic cables.  No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter. Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation. White is the synthesis. It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey  the six largest nations in the world in descending order  China  India  Facebook  the United States  Twitter and Indonesia.  Laughter  Why do we want to get in these nets  Why do we want to be involved  We talked earlier about the Arab Spring  and the power of all this. I'll give you another example  and it's how you move this message. I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point. I said  as I say to all of you  I'm on Facebook. Friend me. Got a little laugh from the audience. There was an article which was run by AP  on the wire. Got picked up in two places in the world  Finland and Indonesia. The headline was  NATO Admiral Needs Friends. Thank you.  Applause  Which I do.  Laughter  And the story was a catalyst  and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns  mostly saying   Admiral  we heard you need a friend  and oh  by the way  what is NATO    Laughter  So ...  Laughter  Yeah  we laugh  but this is how we move the message  and moving that message is how we connect international  interagency  private public  and these social nets to help create security. Now  let me hit a somber note. This is a photograph of a brave British soldier. He's in the Scots Guards. He's standing the watch in Helmand  in southern Afghanistan. I put him here to remind us  I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable  competent militaries who can create real military effect. That is the core of who we are and what we do  and we do it to protect freedom  freedom of speech  all the things we treasure in our societies. But  you know  life is not an on and off switch. You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks. I would argue life is a rheostat. You have to dial it in  and as I think about how we create security in this   st century  there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis  but there will be many instances  as we've talked about today  where our militaries can be part of creating   st century security  international  interagency  private public  connected with competent communication. I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts  and as all of you appreciate  Wikipedia is not created by    brilliant people locked in a room writing articles. Wikipedia  every day  is tens of thousands of people inputting information  and every day millions of people withdrawing that information. It's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. No one person  no one alliance  no one nation  no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together. The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple  a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. My thesis for you is that by combining international  interagency  private public  strategic communication  together  in this   st century  we can create the sum of all security. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Hi. This is my mobile phone. A mobile phone can change your life  and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom. With a mobile phone  you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. With a mobile phone  you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. And with a mobile phone  you can record a song  load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. All this is possible with your mobile phone. I'm a child of       and I live in the city of Berlin. Let's go back to that time  to this city. Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. This is autumn       and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket. Who in the room has a mobile phone with you  Hold it up. Hold your phones up  hold your phones up  Hold it up. An Android  a Blackberry  wow. That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone  and how it changed my life. And I will talk about this. These are        lines of information. Raw data. And why are these informations there  Because in the summer of       the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. This directive  is  called Data Retention Directive. This directive says that each phone company in Europe  each Internet service company all over Europe  has to store a wide range of information about the users. Who calls whom  Who sends whom an email  Who sends whom a text message  And if you use your mobile phone  where you are. All this information is stored for at least six months  up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. And all over Europe  people stood up and said   We don't want this.  They said  we don't want this data retention. We want self determination in the digital age  and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. They were lawyers  journalists  priests  they all said   We don't want this.  And here you can see  like    thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said   Freedom  not fear.  And some even said  this would be Stasi  . . Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. And I also ask myself  does it really work  Can they really store all this information about us  Every time I use my mobile phone  So I asked my phone company  Deutsche Telekom  which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany  and I asked them  please  send me all the information you have stored about me. And I asked them once  and I asked them again  and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. But then I said  I want to have this information  because this is my life you are protocoling. So I decided to start a lawsuit against them  because I wanted to have this information. But Deutsche Telekom said  no  we will not give you this information. So at the end  I had a settlement with them. I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. Because in the mean time  the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. And on the C.D.  this was on. Thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. At first I saw it  and I said  okay  it's a huge file. Okay. But then after a while I realized  this is my life. This is six months of my life  into this file. So I was a little bit skeptical  what should I do with it  Because you can see where I am  where I sleep at night  what I am doing. But then I said  I want to go out with this information. I want to make them public. Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City  I did this. This is a visualization of six months of my life. You can zoom in and zoom out  you can wind back and fast forward. You can see every step I take. And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne  and how often I call in between. All this is possible with this information. That's a little bit scary. But it is not only about me. It's about all of us. First  it's only like  I call my wife and she calls me  and we talk to each other a couple of times. And then there are some friends calling me  and they call each other. And after a while you are calling you  and you are calling you  and you have this great communication network. But you can see how your people are communicating with each other  what times they call each other  when they go to bed. You can see all of this. You can see the hubs  like who are the leaders in the group. If you have access to this information  you can see what your society is doing. If you have access to this information  you can control your society. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. This is a blueprint how to survey your society  because you know who talks to whom  who sends whom an email  all this is possible if you have access to this information. And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe  up to two years. Like I said at the beginning  imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of      had a mobile phone in their pocket. And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest  and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it  this may never have happened. The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not  have been  there. And in the aftermath  also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. Because today  state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us  online and offline. They want to have the possibility to track our lives  and they want to store them for all time. But self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. But you have to fight for your self determination today. You have to fight for it every day. So  when you go home  tell your friends that privacy is a value of the   st century  and it's not outdated. When you go home  tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information  they don't have to do it. And if you don't believe me  ask your phone company what information they store about you. So  in the future  every time you use your mobile phone  let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age. Thank you. I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from. And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well. When I'm walking around an art gallery  rooms and rooms full of paintings  after about    or    minutes  I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings. I'm not connecting to them. Instead  I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up. I'm suffering from gallery fatigue. How many of you out there suffer from    yes. Ha ha  ha ha  Now  sometimes you might last longer than    minutes  or even shorter  but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have the accompanying guilt  For me  I look at the paintings on the wall and I think  somebody has decided to put them there  thinks they're good enough to be on that wall  but I don't always see it. In fact  most of the time I don't see it. And I leave feeling actually unhappy. I feel guilty and unhappy with myself  rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting  I think there's something wrong with me. And that's not a good experience  to leave a gallery like that. The thing is  I think we should give ourselves a break. If you think about going into a restaurant  when you look at the menu  are you expected to order every single thing on the menu  No  You select. If you go into a department store to buy a shirt  are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt  Of course not  you can be selective. It's expected. How come  then  it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery  Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting  Well I'm trying to take a different approach. And there's two things I do  When I go into a gallery  first of all  I go quite fast  and I look at everything  and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other. I don't even know why they make me slow down  but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others  and I just go to that painting. So it's the first thing I do is  I do my own curation. I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in   . And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting  and I tell myself a story about it. Why a story  Well  I think that we are wired  our DNA tells us to tell stories. We tell stories all the time about everything  and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy  chaotic place  and sometimes stories  we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit  trying to bring some order to it. Why not apply that to our looking at paintings  So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries. There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them. The first one needs little introduction     Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Johannes Vermeer    th century Dutch painter. This is the most glorious painting. I first saw it when I was     and I immediately went out and got a poster of it  and in fact I still have that poster.    years later it's hanging in my house. It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone  I never tire of looking at her. What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face. But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing  and that is the look on her face  the conflicted look on her face. I can't tell if she's happy or sad  and I change my mind all the time. So that keeps me coming back. One day     years after I had this poster on my wall  I lay in bed and looked at her  and I suddenly thought  I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that. And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him. Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl. Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship. And I thought  well  what is that relationship  So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered  we have no idea who she is. In fact  we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are  and we know very little about Vermeer himself. Which made me go   Yippee   I can do whatever I want  I can come up with whatever story I want to. So here's how I came up with the story. First of all  I thought  I've got to get her into the house. How does Vermeer know her  Well  there've been suggestions that she is his    year old daughter. The daughter at the time was    when he painted the painting. And I thought  no  it's a very intimate look  but it's not a look a daughter gives her father. For one thing  in Dutch painting of the time  if a woman's mouth was open  it was indicating sexual availability. It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that. So it's not his daughter  but it's somebody close to him  physically close to him. Well  who else would be in the house  A servant  a lovely servant. So  she's in the house. How do we get her into the studio  We don't know very much about Vermeer  but the little bits that we do know  one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman  they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he    his studio. He also had    children. It would have been a chaotic  noisy household. And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before  you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet. How does a painter paint such calm  quiet paintings with    kids around  Well  he compartmentalizes his life. He gets to his studio  and he says   Nobody comes in here. Not the wife  not the kids. Okay  the maid can come in and clean.  She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio  they're together. And he decides to paint her. He has her wear very plain clothes. Now  all of the women  or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet  silk  fur  very sumptuous materials. This is very plain  the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring. Now  if she's a servant  there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings. So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they  We happen to know  there's a list of Catharina  the wife's clothes. Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur  a yellow and black bodice  and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings  different women in the paintings  Vermeer's paintings. So clearly  her clothes were lent to various different women. It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife. So we've got all the elements for our story. She's in the studio with him for a long time. These paintings took a long time to make. They would have spent the time alone  all that time. She's wearing his wife's pearl earring. She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted. And does the wife know  Maybe not. And if she doesn't  well    that's the story. The next painting I'm going to talk about is called  Boy Building a House of Cards  by Chardin. He's an   th century French painter best known for his still lifes  but he did occasionally paint people. And in fact  he painted four versions of this painting  different boys building houses of cards  all concentrated. I like this version the best  because some of the boys are older and some are younger  and to me  this one  like Goldilocks's porridge  is just right. He's not quite a child  and he's not quite a man. He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience  and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting. And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit. The light comes in from the left  his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting  and you look at it  and I found that when I was looking at it  I was standing there going   Look at me. Please look at me.  And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards  and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is  he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us. And that is  to me  the sign of a masterpiece  of a painting when there's a lack of resolution. He's never going to look at me. So I was thinking of a story where  if I'm in this position  who could be there looking at him  Not the painter  I don't want to think about the painter. I'm thinking of an older version of himself. He's a man  a servant  an older servant looking at this younger servant  saying   Look at me. I want to warn you about what you're about to go through. Please look at me.  And he never does. And that lack of resolution  the lack of resolution in  Girl with a Pearl Earring     we don't know if she's happy or sad. I've written an entire novel about her  and I still don't know if she's happy or sad. Again and again  back to the painting  looking for the answer  looking for the story to fill in that gap. And we may make a story  and it satisfies us momentarily  but not really  and we come back again and again. The last painting I'm going to talk about is called  Anonymous  by anonymous.  Laughter  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery. They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury  and then they discovered that it wasn't him  and they have no idea who it is. Now  in the National Portrait Gallery  if you don't know the biography of the painting  it's kind of useless to you. They can't hang it on the wall  because they don't know who he is. So unfortunately  this orphan spends most of his time in storage  along with quite a number of other orphans  some of them some beautiful paintings. This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons  One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful. He's not happy  and why isn't he happy  The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks. He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made  This must be a guy who blushes all the time. What is he thinking about that's making him blush  The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet. Silk  gray  those beautiful buttons. And you know what it makes me think of  is it's sort of snug and puffy  it's like a duvet spread over a bed. I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks  and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him  and I thought  is that what he's thinking about  And I thought  if I'm going to make a story  what's the last thing I'm going to put in there  Well  what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with  And I thought  well  Henry VIII  okay. He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance  with his heir. Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune  You put all those together  and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back. Now  here's the story. It's short.  Rosy  I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me. It has a plain high collar  detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread  set close together so that the fit is snug. The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed. Perhaps that was the intention. I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor. I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed. I have always flushed easily  from physical exertion  from wine  from high emotion. As a boy  I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys  but not by George. Only George could call me Rosy. I would not allow anyone else. He managed to make the word tender. When I made the announcement  George did not turn rosy  but went pale as my doublet. He should not have been surprised. It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin. But it is difficult to hear the words aloud. I know  I could barely utter them. Afterwards  I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden. Despite drinking steadily all afternoon  he was still pale. We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.  What do you think of my doublet   I asked. He glanced at me.  That collar looks to be strangling you.   We will still see each other   I insisted.  We can still hunt and play cards and attend court. Nothing need change.  George did not speak.  I am    years old. It is time for me to marry and produce an heir. It is expected of me.  George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.  Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials  James. I'm sure you'll be content together.  He never used my nickname again. Thank you. Thank you. Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple  and exposure just a millionth of a second. But now     years later  we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion  but one trillion frames per second. I present to you a new type of photography  femto photography  a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. And with that  we can create cameras that can look around corners  beyond line of sight  or see inside our body without an x ray  and really challenge what we mean by a camera. Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second    which is several femtoseconds    I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide. And that packet of photons  that bullet  will travel at the speed of light  and again  a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. Now  if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle  how will those photons shatter into this bottle  How does light look in slow motion   Light in Slow Motion ...    Billion x Slow  Now  the whole event    Now remember  the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond    that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of    billion  so you can see the light in motion. But Coca Cola did not sponsor this research. Now  there's a lot going on in this movie  so let me break this down and show you what's going on. So the pulse enters the bottle  our bullet  with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. Some of the light leaks  goes on the table  and you start seeing these ripples of waves. Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. As you can see  there's a bubble of air and it's bouncing around inside. Meanwhile  the ripples are traveling on the table  and because of the reflections at the top  you see at the back of the bottle  after several frames  the reflections are focused. Now  if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video    again  by a factor of    billion    do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie  A day  a week  Actually  a whole year. It'll be a very boring movie    of a slow  ordinary bullet in motion. And what about some still life photography  You can watch the ripples  again  washing over the table  the tomato and the wall in the back. It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. I thought  this is how nature paints a photo  one femto frame at a time  but of course our eye sees an integral composite. But if you look at this tomato one more time  you will notice  as the light washes over the tomato  it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that  Because the tomato is actually ripe  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. So in the future  when this femto camera is in your camera phone  you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. So how did my team at MIT create this camera  Now  as photographers  you know  if you take a short exposure photo  you get very little light. But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure  so you're going to get hardly any light. So what we do is we send that bullet    that packet of photons    millions of times  and record again and again with very clever synchronization  and from the gigabytes of data  we computationally weave together to create those femto videos I showed you. And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. So  Superman can fly. Some other heroes can become invisible. But what about a new power for a future superhero  To see around corners. The idea is that we could shine some light on the door  it's going to bounce  go inside the room  some of that is going to reflect back on the door  and then back to the camera. And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. On the left  you see our femto camera. There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall  and we're going to bounce light off the door. So after our paper was published in Nature Communications  it was highlighted by Nature.com  and they created this animation.  A laser pulse is fired  Ramesh Raskar  We're going to fire those bullets of light  and they're going to hit this wall  and because of the packet of the photons  they will scatter in all the directions  and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin  which in turn will again scatter that light  and again in turn  the door will reflect some of that scattered light. And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera  but most interestingly  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. And because we have a camera that can run so fast    our femto camera    it has some unique abilities. It has very good time resolution  and it can look at the world at the speed of light. And this way  we know the distances  of course to the door  but also to the hidden objects  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By shining one laser  we can record one raw photo  which  if you look on the screen  doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures  dozens of such pictures  put them together  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light  and from that  can we see the hidden object  Can we see it in full  D  So this is our reconstruction. Now  we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road  but in the future  we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders  and also for cardioscopes. But of course  because of tissue and blood  this is quite challenging  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. Now  like Doc Edgerton  a scientist himself  science became art    an art of ultra fast photography. And I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time  are not just for scientific imaging. But we can also do a new form of computational photography  with time lapse and color coding. And we look at those ripples. Remember  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But there's also something funny going on here. When you look at the ripples under the cap  the ripples are moving away from us. The ripples should be moving towards us. What's going on here  It turns out  because we're recording nearly at the speed of light  we have strange effects  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order. So by applying the corresponding space and time warp  we can correct for this distortion. So whether it's for photography around corners  or creating the next generation of health imaging  or creating new visualizations  since our invention  we have open sourced all the data and details on our website  and our hope is that the DIY  the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras    and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. It's about time. Thank you. As an architect  I often ask myself  what is the origin of the forms that we design  What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore  If we had no bias  if we had no preconceptions  what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience  If we could free ourselves from our education  What would these unseen forms look like  Would they surprise us  Would they intrigue us  Would they delight us  If so  then how can we go about creating something that is truly new  I propose we look to nature. Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms. And I'm not saying that we should copy nature  I'm not saying we should mimic biology  instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes. We can abstract them and to create something that is new. Nature's main process of creation  morphogenesis  is the splitting of one cell into two cells. And these cells can either be identical  or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division. If we abstract this process  and simplify it as much as possible  then we could start with a single sheet of paper  one surface  and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces. We're free to choose where we make the fold. And by doing so  we can differentiate the surfaces. Through this very simple process  we can create an astounding variety of forms. Now  we can take this form and use the same process to generate three dimensional structures  but rather than folding things by hand  we'll bring the structure into the computer  and code it as an algorithm. And in doing so  we can suddenly fold anything. We can fold a million times faster  we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations. And as we're seeking to make something three dimensional  we start not with a single surface  but with a volume. A simple volume  the cube. If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again  then after    iterations     steps  we end up with         surfaces and a shape that looks  for instance  like this. And if we change where we make the folds  if we change the folding ratio  then this cube turns into this one. We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape  or this shape. So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold  but essentially you're looking at a folded cube. And we can play with this. We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions. We can begin to sculpt the form. And because we're doing the folding on the computer  we are completely free of any physical constraints. So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves  they can become impossibly small. We can make folds that we otherwise could not make. Surfaces can become porous. They can stretch. They can tear. And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce. But in each case  I didn't design the form. I designed the process that generated the form. In general  if we make a small change to the folding ratio  which is what you're seeing here  then the form changes correspondingly. But that's only half of the story      .  percent of the folding ratios produce not this  but this  the geometric equivalent of noise. The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error. A far more effective way to create forms  I have found  is to use information that is already contained in forms. A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye. So  for instance  we can plot the length of the edges. White surfaces have long edges  black ones have short ones. We can plot the planarity of the surfaces  their curvature  how radial they are    all information that may not be instantly visible to you  but that we can bring out  that we can articulate  and that we can use to control the folding. So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it  but instead I'm establishing a rule  I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded. And because I've designed the process and not the form  I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms. These forms look elaborate  but the process is a very minimal one. There is a simple input  it's always a cube that I start with  and it's a very simple operation    it's making a fold  and doing this over and over again. So let's bring this process to architecture. How  And at what scale  I chose to design a column. Columns are architectural archetypes. They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty  about technology. A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column. I started using four cylinders. Through a lot of experimentation  these cylinders eventually evolved into this. And these columns  they have information at very many scales. We can begin to zoom into them. The closer one gets  the more new features one discovers. Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility. And unlike traditional architecture  it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail. These forms are undrawable. An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months  or it would take even a year to draw all the sections  all of the elevations  you can only create something like this through an algorithm. The more interesting question  perhaps  is  are these forms imaginable  Usually  an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing. In this case  the process is deterministic. There's no randomness involved at all  but it's not entirely predictable. There's too many surfaces  there's too much detail  one can't see the end state. So this leads to a new role for the architect. One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there. For one thing  one can design many variants of a form  in parallel  and one can cultivate them. And to go back to the analogy with nature  one can begin to think in terms of populations  one can talk about permutations  about generations  about crossing and breeding to come up with a design. And the architect is really  he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes. But enough of the theory. At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image  so to say  I bought these red and blue  D glasses  got up very close to the screen  but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things. So there was only one possibility    to bring the column out of the computer. There's been a lot of talk now about  D printing. For me  or for my purpose at this moment  there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale  on the one hand  and resolution and speed  on the other. So instead  we decided to take the column  and we decided to build it as a layered model  made out of very many slices  thinly stacked over each other. What you're looking at here is an X ray of the column that you just saw  viewed from the top. Unbeknownst to me at the time  because we had only seen the outside  the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves  to grow on the inside of the column  which was quite a surprising discovery. From this shape  we calculated a cutting line  and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce    and you're seeing a segment of it here    very many thin slices  individually cut  on top of each other. And this is a photo now  it's not a rendering  and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work  ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer. Almost all of the details  almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved. But it was very labor intensive. There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical. It took me several months to design the column  but ultimately it takes the computer about    seconds to calculate all of the    million faces. The physical model  on the other hand  is       layers  one millimeter thick  it weighs     kilos  it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium. And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again. But it is increasingly possible. Machines are getting faster  it's getting less expensive  and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon. These are images from the Gwangju Biennale. And in this case  I used ABS plastic to produce the columns  we used the bigger  faster machine  and they have a steel core inside  so they're structural  they can bear loads for once. Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns. You can see a different column in the mirror  if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion. So where does this leave us  I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object  but a process to generate objects. I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature  there's countless other ones. In short  we have no constraints. Instead  we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up. And  if I may add  at one point we will build them. Thank you.  Applause  This man is wearing what we call a bee beard.  Laughter  A beard full of bees. Now  this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees  maybe insects  or maybe anything that has more legs than two. And let me start by telling you  I gotcha. I understand that. But  there are many things to know  and I want you to open your minds here  keep them open  and change your perspective about honeybees. Notice that this man is not getting stung. He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin  and the other bees are attracted to it. So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees  and that goes deep back for thousands of years. We're very co evolved  because we depend on bees for pollination and  even more recently  as an economic commodity. Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing  not just dying  but they're gone. We don't even find dead bodies. This is called colony collapse disorder  and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe still do not know what's causing it  but what we do know is that  with the declining numbers of bees  the costs of over     fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price. So honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture. Here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs  or urban agriculture. We're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the South End. That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard. And perhaps a green roof in the future  when we're further utilizing urban areas  where there are stacks of garden spaces. Check out this image above the orange line in Boston. Try to spot the beehive. It's there. It's on the rooftop  right on the corner there  and it's been there for a couple of years now. The way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden  and it's not because they need to be. It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea  and that's why I want you today to try to think about this  think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing. Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works. So we know flowers  we know fruits and vegetables  even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat  rely on pollinators  but you've got male and female parts to a plant here  and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar  and in the process  a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen  or that male kind of sperm counterpart  along the way  and then travel to different flowers  and eventually an apple  in this case  will be produced. You can see the orientation. The stem is down. The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it  but that's a basic overview of how pollination works. And let's think about urban living  not today  and not in the past  but what about in a hundred years  What's it gonna look like  We have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people  billions of people  in     years  God knows how many people  and how little space there will be to fit all of them  so we need to change the way that we see cities  and looking at this picture on the left of New York City today  you can see how gray and brown it is. We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere  contributing to global climate change  no doubt. What about in     years  if we have green rooftops everywhere  and gardening  and we create our own crops right in the cities  We save on the costs of transportation  we save on a healthier diet  and we also educate and create new jobs locally. We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living. Here's some data that we collected through our company with Best Bees  where we deliver  install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them  in the city  in the countryside  and we introduce honeybees  and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape  for even that matter  and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is. There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here  overwintering survival. Now this has been a huge problem for many years  basically since the late     s  when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses  bacteria and fungal diseases with it. Overwintering success is hard  and that's when most of the colonies are lost  and we found that in the cities  bees are surviving better than they are in the country. A bit counterintuitive  right  We think  oh  bees  countryside  agriculture  but that's not what the bees are showing. The bees like it in the city.  Laughter  Furthermore  they also produce more honey. The urban honey is delicious. The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel  where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by  are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious  healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city. So the yield for urban hives  in terms of honey production  is higher as well as the overwintering survival  compared to rural areas. Again  a bit counterintuitive. And looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health  we can go back to the year     and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland. So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily something new. It has been happening since over a thousand years ago  but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities. So one thing I want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is. You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer. Why are bees doing better in the city  This is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city. Perhaps there's more pollen in the city. With the trains coming in to urban hubs  they can carry pollen with them  very light pollen  and it's just a big supermarket in the city. A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks. Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in  rural  areas. Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet  but that's one idea to think about  urban islands. And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying  and it's a huge  huge grand challenge of our time. What you can see up here is a map of the world  and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite. Now  the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping  and you can see  at the top right  the years are changing  we're coming up to modern times  and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early     s through now. It's       and we're pretty much covering Asia.       we saw it spread to Europe and South America  and then  when we get to the     s  and specifically to       the varroa mite finally came to North America and to the United States  and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the United States. Many of us will remember our childhood growing up  maybe you got stung by a bee  you saw bees on flowers. Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different. They don't experience this. The bees just aren't around anymore. So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem. What can we do here  So  what I do is honeybee research. I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health. I started in      studying honeybees. In       honeybees started disappearing  so suddenly  like  this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs    Laughter    became very relevant in the world. And it worked out that way. So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier. I don't research what's killing the bees  per se. I'm not one of the many researchers around the world who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees. We're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines  through yogurt  like probiotics  and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees  and this process is so easy  even a   year old can do it. You just mix up some pollen  sugar and water  and whatever active ingredient you want to put in  and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved  just immune boosters. Humans think about our own health in a prospective way. We exercise  we eat healthy  we take vitamins. Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way  Bring them to areas where they're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick. I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles.  Laughter  Like  years  years at the bench   Oh my gosh  it's   a.m. and I'm still pricking bees.   Laughter  And then one day I said   Why don't we just do an oral vaccine   It's like   Ugh   so that's what we do.  Laughter  I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives  because they can be anything. I mean  really open your mind with this. You can paint a hive to match your home. You can hide a hive inside your home. These are three hives on the rooftop of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel  and they're beautiful here. I mean  we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets  and these bees are terrific  and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden. That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking  and the honey    they do live events    they'll use that honey at their bars. Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there. We also have a classroom hives project  where    this is a nonprofit venture    we're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting  behind glass  and used as an educational tool. This hive that you see here has been in Fenway High School for many years now. The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park. Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower  these bees do not care about you.  Laughter  They don't. They don't. They'll say   S'cuse me  flying around.   Laughter  Some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in New York City  beekeeping was illegal until     . That's a big problem  because what's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally  Hands  I mean  locally in Boston  there is a terrific company called Green City Growers  and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q Tips  and if they miss that three day window  there's no fruit. Their clients aren't happy  and people go hungry. So this is important. We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn. Now  this was a mystery in the New York Times where the honey was very red  and the New York State forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street.  Laughter  So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee friendly flowers. Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping. They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now  and that's what really got people started  thinking   Wow  we can do this  and we should do this.  Also in London  and in Europe across the board  they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives  and I'll show you an ending note here. I would like to encourage you to open your mind. What can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future  Well  really  just change your perspective. Try to understand that bees are very important. A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it. The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting  so they don't want to do it either.  Laughter  It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city. You could even get your own hive if you want. There are great resources available  and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you and it's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl  who  again  is not even getting stung. Thank you.  Applause  In the past several days  I heard people talking about China. And also  I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet. Something is very challenging to me. I want to make my friends understand  China is complicated. So I always want to tell the story  like  one hand it is that  the other hand is that. You can't just tell a one sided story. I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country. BRIC country means Brazil  Russia  India and China. This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy. But at the same time  on the other hand  China is a SICK country  the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers    file. He said the SICK country means Syria  Iran  China and North Korea. The four countries have no access to Facebook. So basically  China is a SICK BRIC country. Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet. And now  today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years  from that wall. So  if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones  you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom. It prevents weird things from the north. Same was true for China. In the north  there was a great wall  Chang Cheng. It protected China from invaders for       years. But China also has a great firewall. That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world. It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas  from the universal values  but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet  and even separate themselves into blocks  not united. So  basically the  Internet  has two Internets. One is the Internet  the other is the Chinanet. But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland  wasteland  I think it's wrong. But we also use a very simple metaphor  the cat and the mouse game  to describe in the past    years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship  government censorship  the cat  and the Chinese Internet users. That means us  the mouse. But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple. So today I want to upgrade it to  .  version. In China  we have     million Internet users. That's the biggest population of Netizens  Internet users  in the whole world. So even though China's is a totally censored Internet  but still  Chinese Internet society is really booming. How to make it  It's simple. You have Google  we have Baidu. You have Twitter  we have Weibo. You have Facebook  we have Renren. You have YouTube  we have Youku and Tudou. The Chinese government blocked every single international Web  .  service  and we Chinese copycat every one. So  that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship. That's not only to censor you. Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple  Block and clone. On the one hand  he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network  which is very important  people really love social networking. But on the other hand  they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want. That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China  because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server. Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands. For example  Mubarak  he shut down the Internet. He wanted to prevent the Netizens  from criticizing  him. But once Netizens can't go online  they go in the street. And now the result is very simple. We all know Mubarak is technically dead. But also  Ben Ali  Tunisian president  didn't follow the second rule. That means keep the server in your hands. He allowed Facebook  a U.S. based service  to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia. So he can't prevent it  his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption. The same thing happend. He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring. But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media  from  becoming a really public sphere  a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials. Because we have     million microbloggers in China. It's the entire population of the United States. So when these     million people  microbloggers  even they block the tweet in our censored platform. But itself    the Chinanet    but itself can create very powerful energy  which has never happened in the Chinese history.       in July  two  unclear  trains crashed  in Wenzhou  a southern city. Right after the train crash  authorities literally wanted to cover up the train  bury the train. So it angered the Chinese Netizens. The first five days after the train crash  there were    million criticisms of the posting on social media  which never happened in Chinese history. And later this year  the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for    years. And also  recently  very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing. So  the up is the Embassy data  the PM  . . He showed      they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group. So a suggestion  it's not good to go outside. But that is the Ministry's data. He shows   . He says it's good. It's good to go outside. But    percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side. I live in Beijing. Every day  I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window. Why is Chinese social networking  even within the censorship  so booming  Part of the reason is Chinese languages. You know  Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of     characters. But in English it's    words or a sentence with a short link. Maybe in Germany  in German language  it may be just  Aha   But in Chinese language  it's really about     characters  means a paragraph  a story. You can almost have all the journalistic elements there. For example  this is Hamlet  of Shakespeare. It's the same content. One  you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to  .  English tweets. Chinese is always cheating  right  So because of this  the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media  not only a headline to media. And also  the clone  Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter. It even has its own name  with Weibo.  Weibo  is the Chinese translation for  microblog . It has its own innovation. At the commenting area   it makes  the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook  rather than the original Twitter. So these innovations and clones  as the Weibo and microblogging  when it came to China in       it immediately became a media platform itself. It became the media platform of     million readers. It became the media. Anything not mentioned in Weibo  it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public. But also  Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life. For example  they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard. We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system  because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth  The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs. So that's why the petitioner  the victims  the peasants  want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government  they want the emperor to settle the problem. But when more and more people go to Beijing  they also cause the risk of a revolution. So they send them back in recent years. And even some of them were put into black jails. But now we have Weibo  so I call it the Weibo petition. People just use their cell phones to tweet. So your sad stories  by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters  professors or celebrities. One of them is Yao Chen  she is the most popular microblogger in China  who has about    million followers. They're almost like a national TV station. If you    so a sad story will be picked up by her. So this Weibo social media  even in the censorship  still gave the Chinese a real chance for     million people every day chatting together  talking together. It's like a big TED  right  But also  it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China. Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people. But also  the cat  the censorship  is not sleeping. It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo. For example  you can't post the name of the president  Hu Jintao  and also you can't post the city of Chongqing  the name  and until recently  you can't search the surname of top leaders. So  the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes. They even name themselves    you know  use the name of this world changing battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab. The grass mud horse is caon ma  is the phonogram for motherfucker  the Netizens call themselves. River crab is h xi   is the phonogram for harmonization  for censorship. So that's kind of a caon ma versus the h xi   that's very good. So  when some very political  exciting moments happened  you can see on Weibo  you see a lot of very weird stories happened. Weird phrases and words  even if you have a PhD of Chinese language  you can't understand them. But you can't even expand more  no  because Chinese Sina Weibo  when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com. That means from the very beginning  Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government  we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime. For example  anything you want to post  like  get together  or  meet up  or  walk   it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing. Even if you want to have some gathering  before you go there  the police are already waiting for you. Why  Because they have the data. They have everything in their hands. So they can use the      scenario data mining of the dissident. So the crackdown is very serious. But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse. The cat is the censorship  but Chinese is not only one cat  but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats. You know  the server is in the  central  cats' hands  so even that    when the Netizens criticize the local government  the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing. Without bribing the central cats  he can do nothing  only apologize. So these three years  in the past three years  social movements about microblogging really changed local government  became more and more transparent  because they can't access the data. The server is in Beijing. The story about the train crash  maybe the question is not about why    million criticisms in five days  but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online. It's never happened before. And so it's very simple  because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy  this independent kingdom. So they want an excuse    public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him. But also  the Bo Xilai case recently  very big news  he's a princeling. But from February to April this year  Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors. You can almost joke everything about these princelings  everything  It's almost like you're living in the United States. But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing  you definitely will be arrested. So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window. So Chinese in China  censorship is normal. Something you find is  freedom is weird. Something will happen behind it. Because he was a very popular Leftist leader  so the central government wanted to purge him  and he was very cute  he convinced all the Chinese people  why he is so bad. So Weibo  the     million public sphere  became a very good  convenient tool for a political fight. But this technology is very new  but technically is very old. It was made famous by Chairman Mao  Mao Zedong  because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government. It's very simple  because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion. They just give them a target window to not censor people. Not censoring in China has become a political tool. So that's the update about this game  cat and mouse. Social media changed Chinese mindset. More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright  not some imported American privilege. But also  it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to  it's like a training of their citizenship  preparing for future democracy. But it didn't change the Chinese political system  and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions. So  what's the future  After all  we are the mouse. Whatever the future is  we should fight against the  cat . There is not only in China  but also in the United States there are some very small  cute but bad cats. SOPA  PIPA  ACTA  TPP and ITU. And also  like Facebook and Google  they claim they are friends of the mouse  but sometimes we see them dating the cats. So my conclusion is very simple. We Chinese fight for our freedom  you just watch your bad cats. Don't let them hook  up  with the Chinese cats. Only in this way  in the future  we will achieve the dreams of the mouse  that we can tweet anytime  anywhere  without fear. Thank you. Good afternoon. I am not a farmer. I'm not. I'm a parent  I'm a resident and I'm a teacher. And this is my world. And along the way I've started noticing    I'm on my third generation of kids    that they're getting bigger. They're getting sicker. In addition to these complexities  I just learned that    percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition. The realities of my community are simple. They look like this. Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this. And as jobs continue to leave my community  and energy continues to come in  be exported in  it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert. But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet  so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today. And with that note  I come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live  learn and earn in a better one. So I'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside  which I'm now bringing inside. And it starts with three people. The crazy teacher    that's me on the left  I dress up pretty  thank you  my wife  I love you for getting a good suit    my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology. But it all starts with seeds in classrooms  in my place  which looks like this. And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp. And that's really what this is all about. And it starts with incredible kids like this  who come early and stay late. All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners  most come with a lot of handicaps  most are homeless and many are in foster care. Almost all of my kids live below poverty. But with those seeds  from day one  we are growing in my classroom  and this is what it looks like in my classroom. And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds. And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this. But again  I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher. And I don't like weeding  and I don't like back breaking labor. So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small  like this  and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it  kids who didn't want to be outside could do it  and everyone could have access. So I called George Irwin  and what do you know  He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall. And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences  private based learning. And lo and behold  we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City. So if you're hungry  get up and eat. You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time. Okay  But we were just getting started  the kids loved the technology  so we called up George and we said   We gotta learn more   Now  Mayor Bloomberg  thank you very much  we no longer need work permits  which comes with slices and bonded contractors    we're available for you    We decided to go to Boston. And my kids  from the poorest congressional district in America  became the first to install a green wall  designed by a computer  with real live learning tools     stories up    if you're going to go visit it  it's on top of the John Hancock building. But closer to home  we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that  real LED stuff    st century technology. And what do you know  We made   st century money  and that was groundbreaking. Wow  This is my harvest  people. And what do you do with this food  You cook it  And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce  with plastic forks  and we get it into the cafeteria  and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers. And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President. And what'd we do then  Well  I met nice people like you  and they invited us to the Hamptons. So I call this  from South Bronx to Southampton.  And we started putting in roofs that look like this  and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this  wow  People noticed. And so we got invited back this past summer  and we actually moved into the Hamptons  payed       dollars a week for a house  and we learned how to surf. And when you can do stuff like this    These are my kids putting in this technology  and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this  this is the new green graffiti. So  you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids  besides changing landscapes and mindsets  Okay  I'm going to tell you what it does. It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this  Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services. And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line. Because Jim realized that these kids  my future farmers  really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers  right in their own neighborhood. And this is what my kids are doing  making living wage. Now  if you're like me  you live in a building  there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars. I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed or  you know  some shelving  I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me. That's the beauty of this economy. But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade. And that's my first student to open up  the first in his family to have a bank account. This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM. And this is the true triple bottom line  because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this. Wow  People noticed. And notice they did. So CNN called  and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market. And then when Rockefeller Center said  NBC  could you put this thing up on the walls  We were delighted. But this  I show you  when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a    foot by    foot wall  design it  plant it and install it in the heart of New York City  that's a true  s  se puede  moment. Really scholastic  if you ask me. But this is not a Getty image. That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President  addressing my kids in his house  not the jailhouse  making them feel a part of it. That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder  coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important. And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class  believe you me  the Bronx can change attitudes now. We are poised  ready  willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined. And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he's got to lose weight  so do I  And I tell you what  I'm doing it and so are the kids. Okay  And then celebrities started. Produce Pete can't believe what we grow. Lorna Sass came and donated books. Okay  We're feeding seniors. And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx  so did the international community. And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference. And that's just great. Except what about locally  Well  we met this woman  Avis Richards  with the Ground Up Campaign. Unbelievable  Through her  my kids  the most disenfranchised and marginalized  were able to roll out     gardens to New York City public schools. That's triple bottom line  Okay  A year ago today  I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine. I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense  especially when the resources were free. So thank you all and I love them. They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health  again  free resources  don't waste them. And what do you know  Six months later  my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment. The greenest class in New York City. But more importantly is my kids learned to get  they learned to give. And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market  and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world. So we started giving back. And that's when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pockets  then with the heart and then with the mind. So we were onto something  and we're still onto something. And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed  because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine. We're       strong right now. And what does it really do  It teaches kids to re vision their communities  so when they grow up in places like this  they can imagine it like this. And my kids  trained and certified    Ma  you get the tax abatement. Thank you  Mayor Bloomberg    can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that  and that to me  people  is another true  s  se puede  moment. Now  how does it start  It starts in schools. No more little Knicks and little Nets. Group by broccoli  group by your favorite vegetable  something you can aspire to. Okay  And these are my future farmers of America  growing up in Brook Park on    st Street  the most migrant community in America. When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this  it's no wonder we get fruit like that. And I love it  And so do they. And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down. And that's a true  s  se puede  moment. And again  Brook Park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint. The poorest congressional district in America  the most migratory community in America  we can do this. Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions  moving kids into an economy they never imagined. Now  somewhere over the rainbow  my friends  is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it. How does it start  Well  look at Jose's attention to detail. Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground  and not aisle   at the supermarket or through a bullet proof window or through a piece of styrofoam. And when Henry knows that green is good  so do I. And when you expand their palates  you expand their vocabulary. And most importantly  when you put big kids together with little kids  you get the big fat white guy out of the middle  which is cool  and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers  which is incredible. God  I'm going to run out of time  so I've gotta keep it moving. But this is my weekly paycheck for kids  that's our green graffiti. This is what we're doing. And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other. I gotta tell you  I'm a protective parent. But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains. We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent. We're also becoming children of the corn  creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage. Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer  but I expect you to read about it  write about it  blog about it  offer outstanding customer service. I expect them to be engaged  and man  are they  So that's my incredible classroom  that's the food. Where does it go  Zero miles to plate  right down into the cafeteria. Or more importantly  to local shelters  where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day. And we're stepping it up. No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm. And in his day  a million dollar gardens and incredible installations. Let me tell you something  people. This is a beautiful moment. Black field  brown field  toxic waste field  battlefield    we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere  on cement. And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame. We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring. And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything. And again  when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this  we're really creating a moment. Now  you may ask about these kids. Forty percent attendance to    percent attendance. All start overage and under credit. They are now  my first cohort is all in college  earning a living wage. The rest are scheduled to graduate this June. Happy kids  happy families  happy colleagues. Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County. Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint  I grow seven kinds of mint in my class. Mojitos  anybody  I'll be at Telepan later. But  understand this is my intellectual Viagra. Ladies and gentlemen  I gotta move quick  but understand this  The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to the organic ones. My green  unclear         pounds of vegetables  I'm growing organic citizens  engaged kids. So help us go from this to this. Self sustaining entities     months return on investment  plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits  while feeding people for pennies on the dollar. Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity. So here in New York  I urge you  my fellow Americans  to help us make America great again. It's simple. Share your passion. It's real easy. Go see these two videos  please. One got us invited to the White House  one's a recent incarnation. And most importantly  get the biggest bully out of schools. This has got to go tomorrow. People  you can all do that. Keep kids out of stores that look like this. Make them a healthy plate  especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom    delicioso  Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart. Big kids love strawberries and bananas. Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC. Let them cook. Great lunch today  let them do culinary things. But most importantly  just love them. Nothing works like unconditional love. So  my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green. It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy    flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment  where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor. Okay  My dear friend Majora Carter once told me  we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. So here  and at a time when we've gone from the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity  I urge you to do something. I urge you to do something. Right now  we're all tadpoles  but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big  green leap. I don't care if you're on the left  on the right  up the middle  wherever. Join me. Use    I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it. We can do something here. And along the way  please take time to smell the flowers  especially if you and your students grew them. I'm Steve Ritz  this is Green Bronx Machine. I've got to say thank you to my wife and family  for my kids  thank you for coming every day  and for my colleagues  believing and supporting me. We are growing our way into a new economy. Thank you  God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz. S  se puede  Like many of you  I'm one of the lucky people. I was born to a family where education was pervasive. I'm a third generation PhD  a daughter of two academics. In my childhood  I played around in my father's university lab. So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities  which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity. Unfortunately  most of the people in the world are not so lucky. In some parts of the world  for example  South Africa  education is just not readily accessible. In South Africa  the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority. And as a consequence  today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education. That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg. There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process  and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration  thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long  hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions. When the gates opened  there was a stampede  and    people were injured and one woman died. She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life. But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available  it might not be within reach. There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care. What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate  for a total of     percent since     . This makes education unaffordable for many people. Finally  even for those who do manage to get the higher education  the doors of opportunity might not open. Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education. This  of course  is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions  but for many others  they do not get the value for their time and their effort. Tom Friedman  in his recent New York Times article  captured  in the way that no one else could  the spirit behind our effort. He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary. I've talked about what's desperately necessary. Let's talk about what's suddenly possible. What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes  each of which had an enrollment of         people or more. So to understand this  let's look at one of those classes  the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng. Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes. It's a Machine Learning class  and it has     people enrolled every time it's offered. When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public  it had         people registered. So to put that number in perspective  for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class  he would have to do that for     years. Of course  he'd get really bored. So  having seen the impact of this  Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up  to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could. So we formed Coursera  whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free. We currently have    courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines  and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like. Ezekiel Emanuel  Fifty million people are uninsured. Scott Page  Models help us design more effective institutions and policies. We get unbelievable segregation. Scott Klemmer  So Bush imagined that in the future  you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head. Mitchell Duneier  Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ... RG  Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine. Nick Parlante  For each pixel in the image  set the red to zero. Paul Offit  ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus. Dan Jurafsky  Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose  Well  that sounds funny. Daphne Koller  So this is which coin you pick  and this is the two tosses. Andrew Ng  So in large scale machine learning  we'd like to come up with computational ... DK  It turns out  maybe not surprisingly  that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free. Since we opened the website in February  we now have         students from     countries. We have  .  million enrollments    million quizzes in the    classes that have launched so far have been submitted  and    million videos have been viewed. But it's not just about the numbers  it's also about the people. Whether it's Akash  who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it. Or Jenny  who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree. Or Ryan  who can't go to school  because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house  so he couldn't leave the house. I'm really glad to say    recently  we've been in correspondence with Ryan    that this story had a happy ending. Baby Shannon    you can see her on the left    is doing much better now  and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses. So what made these courses so different  After all  online course content has been available for a while. What made it different was that this was real course experience. It started on a given day  and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments. And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade  with a real deadline. You can see the deadlines and the usage graph. These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon. At the end of the course  the students got a certificate. They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job  and we know many students who did. Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit. So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort. Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses. The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format  you can break away from  for example  the monolithic one hour lecture. You can break up the material  for example  into these short  modular units of eight to    minutes  each of which represents a coherent concept. Students can traverse this material in different ways  depending on their background  their skills or their interests. So  for example  some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have. Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually. So this format allows us to break away from the one size fits all model of education  and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum. Of course  we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos. Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it. There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this. This one that appeared in Science last year  for example  demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice  where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions. We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform  as well as other forms of practice in many ways. For example  even our videos are not just videos. Every few minutes  the video pauses and the students get asked a question. status quo bias  base rate bias. They're all well documented. So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior. DK  So here the video pauses  and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention. So they get to try again  and this time they got it right. There's an optional explanation if they want. And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture. This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class  but when I ask that kind of a question in class     percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said     percent are zoned out on Facebook  and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it  and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer. And so the lecture moves on before  really  most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked. Here  every single student has to engage with the material. And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story. One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions  and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions. Now  how do you grade the work of         students if you do not have        TAs  The answer is  you need to use technology to do it for you. Now  fortunately  technology has come a long way  and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework. In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video  we can also grade math  mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations. We can grade models  whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments. Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual. This is from Stanford's Computer Science     class  and the students are supposed to color correct that blurry red image. They're typing their program into the browser  and you can see they didn't get it quite right  Lady Liberty is still seasick. And so  the student tries again  and now they got it right  and they're told that  and they can move on to the next assignment. This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning. Now  of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses. Specifically  what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities  the social sciences  business and others. So we tried to convince  for example  some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy. That didn't go over really well. So we had to come up with a different solution. And the solution we ended up using is peer grading. It turns out that previous studies show  like this one by Saddler and Good  that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades. It was tried only in small classes  but there it showed  for example  that these student assigned grades on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis. What's even more surprising is that self grades  where the students grade their own work critically    so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score    are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades. And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale  and is also a useful learning strategy for the students  because they actually learn from the experience. So we now have the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised  where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work  and quite successfully  I have to say. But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems. Around each one of our courses  a community of students had formed  a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor. What you see here is a self generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology     course  where they have put themselves on a world map  and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort. Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways. First of all  there was a question and answer forum  where students would pose questions  and other students would answer those questions. And the really amazing thing is  because there were so many students  it means that even if a student posed a question at   o'clock in the morning  somewhere around the world  there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem. And so  in many of our courses  the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was    minutes. Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students. And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community  they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom. Students also self assembled  without any kind of intervention from us  into small study groups. Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets. This is the San Francisco study group  but there were ones all over the world. Others were virtual study groups  sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines  and on the bottom left there  you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures. There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework. The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning. Because the data that we can collect here is unique. You can collect every click  every homework submission  every forum post from tens of thousands of students. So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis driven mode to the data driven mode  a transformation that  for example  has revolutionized biology. You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like  what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not  And in the context of particular courses  you can ask questions like  what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them  So here's an example of that  also from Andrew's Machine Learning class. This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments. The answers happen to be pairs of numbers  so you can draw them on this two dimensional plot. Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer. The big cross at the top left is where       students gave the exact same wrong answer. Now  if two students in a class of     give the same wrong answer  you would never notice. But when       students give the same wrong answer  it's kind of hard to miss. So Andrew and his students went in  looked at some of those assignments  understood the root cause of the misconception  and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket  which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively. So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers. Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well  because it provides us with the potential of solving a    year old problem. Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom  in       posed what's called the   sigma problem  which he observed by studying three populations. The first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom. The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom  but with a mastery based approach  so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one. And finally  there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor. The mastery based population was a full standard deviation  or sigma  in achievement scores better than the standard lecture based class  and the individual tutoring gives you   sigma improvement in performance. To understand what that means  let's look at the lecture based classroom  and let's pick the median performance as a threshold. So in a lecture based class  half the students are above that level and half are below. In the individual tutoring instruction     percent of the students are going to be above that threshold. Imagine if we could teach so that    percent of our students would be above average. Hence  the   sigma problem. Because we cannot afford  as a society  to provide every student with an individual human tutor. But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone. So the question is  how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph  from the blue curve  to the right side with the green curve  Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer  because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times. And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times  we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you. And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of  whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you. So the goal here is to try and push  and see how far we can get towards the green curve. So  if this is so great  are universities now obsolete  Well  Mark Twain certainly thought so. He said that   College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes  without passing through the brains of either.  I beg to differ with Mark Twain  though. I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on. So let's go back even further  to Plutarch  who said that   The mind is not a vessel that needs filling  but wood that needs igniting.  And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them  and more time igniting their creativity  their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them. So how do we do that  We do that by doing active learning in the classroom. So there's been many studies  including this one  that show that if you use active learning  interacting with your students in the classroom  performance improves on every single metric    on attendance  on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test. You can see  for example  that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment. So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities. So to summarize  if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free  what would that do  Three things. First it would establish education as a fundamental human right  where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves  their families and their communities. Second  it would enable lifelong learning. It's a shame that for so many people  learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college. By having this amazing content be available  we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted  whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives. And finally  this would enable a wave of innovation  because amazing talent can be found anywhere. Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa. And if we could offer that person an education  they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us. Thank you very much. Before March        I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City. We're pale  gray creatures. We hide in dark  windowless rooms  and generally avoid sunlight. We make skinny models skinnier  perfect skin more perfect  and the impossible possible  and we get criticized in the press all the time  but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography. On March           I watched from home  as the rest of the world did  as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. Soon after  an organization I volunteer with  All Hands Volunteers  were on the ground  within days  working as part of the response efforts. I  along with hundreds of other volunteers  knew we couldn't just sit at home  so I decided to join them for three weeks. On May the   th  I made my way to the town of  funato. It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture  about        people  one of the first that was hit by the wave. The waters here have been recorded at reaching over    meters in height  and traveled over two miles inland. As you can imagine  the town had been devastated. We pulled debris from canals and ditches. We cleaned schools. We de mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation. We cleared tons and tons of stinking  rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant. We got dirty  and we loved it. For weeks  all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things. They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. And everyone was doing the same. They were collecting them up  and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. Now  it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt. As they had run from the wave  and for their lives  absolutely everything they had  everything had to be left behind. At the end of my first week there  I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town. I was helping clean the onsen  the communal onsen  the huge giant bathtubs. This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. This is where people were handing them in  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them. Now  it was emotional and it was inspiring  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened. As I looked through the photos  there were some were over a hundred years old  some still in the envelope from the processing lab  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. So that evening  I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them  and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive  I knew we had to give it a go. So we started retouching photos. This was the very first. Not terribly damaged  but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. Otherwise  that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore  and surely that's as tragic as having the photo damaged. Over time  more photos came in  thankfully  and more retouchers were needed  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn  and within five days     people wanted to help from    different countries. Within two weeks  I had     people wanting to join in. Within Japan  by July  we'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata  further north to a town called Yamada. Once a week  we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up  where people were reclaiming their photos. The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before  but within    minutes of them finding their lost photo  they could give it to us  have it scanned  uploaded to a cloud server  it would be downloaded by a gaijin  a stranger  somewhere on the other side of the globe  and it'd start being fixed. The time it took  however  to get it back is a completely different story  and it depended obviously on the damage involved. It could take an hour. It could take weeks. It could take months. The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn  or pieced together  picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. It was very time consuming. Now  all these photos had been damaged by water  submerged in salt water  covered in bacteria  in sewage  sometimes even in oil  all of which over time is going to continue to damage them  so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project. We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned  dry and reclaimed. Now  we were lucky with our hand cleaning. We had an amazing local woman who guided us. It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. As my team leader Wynne once said  it's like doing a tattoo on someone. You don't get a chance to mess it up. The lady who brought us these photos was lucky  as far as the photos go. She had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. She also had duplicates. Areas like her husband and her face  which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix  we could just put them together in one good photo  and remake the whole photo. When she collected the photos from us  she shared a bit of her story with us. Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood  and they'd recognized him. The day of the tsunami  he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. Her two little boys  not so little anymore  but her two boys were both at school  separate schools. One of them got caught up in the water. It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's   th birthday. For her  despite all of this  those photos were the perfect gift back to him  something he could look at again  something he remembered from before that wasn't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed. After six months in Japan        volunteers had passed through All Hands  hundreds of whom had helped us hand clean over         photographs  the large majority    Applause    a large majority of which did actually find their home again  importantly. Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get    families hundreds of photographs back  fully restored and retouched. During this time  we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials  most of which was printer inks. We take photos constantly. A photo is a reminder of someone or something  a place  a relationship  a loved one. They're our memory keepers and our histories  the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for. That's all this project was about  about restoring those little bits of humanity  giving someone that connection back. When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this  it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it. The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. For some of them  it's given them a connection to something bigger  giving something back  using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin. I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them  Cindy  the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.  As I worked  I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. One in particular  a photo of women of all ages  from grandmother to little girl  gathered around a baby  struck a chord  because a similar photo from my family  my grandmother and mother  myself  and newborn daughter  hangs on our wall. Across the globe  throughout the ages  our basic needs are just the same  aren't they   Thank you.  Applause  I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves  but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that  so that was a bad idea.  Laughter  Anyway  I was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer  presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism.  Laughter  And I'm not kidding  I just think we should just say that and move forward.  Laughter  So  but the thing is  a dilemma quickly arose  and that is that I'm really bored with music  and I'm really bored with the role of the composer  and so I decided to put that idea  boredom  as the focus of my presentation to you today. And I'm going to share my music with you  but I hope that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story  tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst for creativity and invention  and how boredom actually forced me to change the fundamental question that I was asking in my discipline  and how boredom also  in a sense  pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of most traditional  narrow definition of a composer. What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt of a piece of music at the piano. Okay  I wrote that.  Laughter  No  it's not    Applause  Oh  why thank you. No  no  I didn't write that. In fact  that was a piece by Beethoven  and so I was not functioning as a composer. Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter  and there I am  interpreter. So  an interpreter of what  Of a piece of music  right  But we can ask the question   But is it music   And I say this rhetorically  because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is  of course  a piece of music  but I put this here now because  just to set it in your brains for the moment  because we're going to return to this question. It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation. So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven  and my problem with it is  it's boring. I mean  you   I'm just like  a hush  huh    It's like     Laughter  It's Beethoven  how can you say that  No  well  I don't know  it's very familiar to me. I had to practice it as a kid  and I'm really sick of it. So     Laughter  I would  so what I might like to try to do is to change it  to transform it in some ways  to personalize it  so I might take the opening  like this idea    and then I might substitute     Music  and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there     Music  So that might be the kind of thing    Why thank you. That would be the kind of thing that I would do  and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven. In fact  I think it's not better than it. The thing is     Laughter     it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me. I'm really leaning into me  because I  because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it. So this is an engaging enterprise for me  and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there  and now my face appears twice  so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  Laughter  But it's an engaging one  and it's interesting to me for a while  but then I get bored with it  and by it  I actually mean  the piano  because it becomes  it's this familiar instrument  it's timbral range is actually pretty compressed  at least when you play on the keyboard  and if you're not doing things like listening to it after you've lit it on fire or something like that  you know. It gets a little bit boring  and so pretty soon I go through other instruments  they become familiar  and eventually I find myself designing and constructing my own instrument  and I brought one with me today  and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you so you can hear what it sounds like. You gotta have doorstops  that's important.  Laughter  I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own.  Music  They're all mounted on my instruments.  Laughter  I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks. So we have this sound.  Music  And with a bank of live electronics  I can change the sounds radically.  Music  Like that  and like this.  Music  And so forth. So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world of this instrument  which I think is quite interesting and it puts me in the role of the inventor  and the nice thing about   This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ...  Laughter  and the cool thing about it is I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player.  Laughter  Okay   Applause  So in that regard  this is one of the things  this is one of the privileges of being  and here's another role  the inventor  and by the way  when I told you that I'm the world's greatest  if you're keeping score  we've had narcissism and solipsism and now a healthy dose of egocentricism. I know some of you are just  you know  bingo  Or  I don't know.  Laughter  Anyway  so this is also a really enjoyable role. I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player  and it was this distinction that I was most worried about when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide. I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that. I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars. Anyway  but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises are engaging to me in their multiplicity  but as I've presented them to you today  they're actually solitary enterprises  and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people  and so I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them. I get to write  sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person  sometimes full orchestras  and I work with a lot of people  and this is probably the capacity  the role creatively for which I'm probably best known professionally. Now  some of my scores as a composer look like this  and others look like this  and some look like this  and I make all of these by hand  and it's really tedious. It takes a long  long time to make these scores  and right now I'm working on a piece that's     pages in length  and it's just a big chunk of my life  and I'm just pulling out hair. I have a lot of it  and that's a good thing I suppose.  Laughter  So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me  so after a while the process of notating is not only boring  but I actually want the notation to be more interesting  and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one. This is an excerpt from a score called  The Metaphysics of Notation.  The full score is    feet wide. It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation. Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates  with straight edges  with French curves  and by freehand  and the    feet was actually split into    six foot wide panels that were installed around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony  and it appeared for one year in the museum  and during that year  it was experienced as visual art most of the week  except  as you can see in these pictures  on Fridays  from noon til one  and only during that time  various performers came and interpreted these strange and undefined pictographic glyphs.  Laughter  Now this was a really exciting experience for me. It was gratifying musically  but I think the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on another role  especially given that it appeared in a museum  and that is as visual artist.  Laughter  We're going to fill up the whole thing  don't worry.  Laughter  I am multitudes.  Laughter  So one of the things is that  I mean  some people would say  like   Oh  you're being a dilettante   and maybe that's true. I can understand how  I mean  because I don't have a pedigree in visual art and I don't have any training  but it's just something that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition  as an extension of a kind of creative impulse. I can understand the question  though.  But is it music   I mean  there's not any traditional notation. I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece   S tog   which I made when I was living in Copenhagen. I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations  and the players  who are synchronized with stopwatches  follow the timetables  which are listed in minutes past the hour. So this is a case of actually adapting something  or maybe stealing something  and then turning it into a musical notation. Another adaptation would be this piece. I took the idea of the wristwatch  and I turned it into a musical score. I made my own faces  and had a company fabricate them  and the players follow these scores. They follow the second hands  and as they pass over the various symbols  the players respond musically. Here's another example from another piece  and then its realization. So in these two capacities  I've been scavenger  in the sense of taking  like  the subway map  right  or thief maybe  and I've also been designer  in the case of making the wristwatches. And once again  this is  for me  interesting. Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist. Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements  and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip from a piece called  Echolalia.  This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter  who is an extraordinary performer. Let's watch a little bit of this  and please notice the instrumentation. Okay  I hear you were laughing nervously because you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp  the intonation was a little questionable.  Laughter  Let's watch just another clip. You can see the mayhem continues  and there's  you know  there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has an even more unusual  more peculiar instrumentation. This is  Tl n   for three conductors and no players.  Laughter  This was based on the experience of actually watching two people having a virulent argument in sign language  which produced no decibels to speak of  but affectively  psychologically  was a very loud experience. So  yeah  I get it  with  like  the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors  people might  you know  wonder  yeah   Is this music   But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself  and that is my  Concerto for Orchestra.  You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.  Music  This  in fact  is not the title of this piece. I was a bit mischievous. In fact  to make it more interesting  I put a space right in here  and this is the actual title of the piece. Let's continue with that same excerpt. It's better with a florist  right   Laughter   Music  Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips. So with all these theatric elements  this pushes me in another role  and that would be  possibly  the dramaturge. I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits  right  Okay  But then there was this other stuff  right  There was the florist  and I can understand that  once again  we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally  but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you. This is going to be a piece called  Aphasia   and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound  and this invites yet another role  and final one I'll share with you  which is that of the choreographer. And the score for the piece looks like this  and it instructs me  the performer  to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape  and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples. I recorded an awesome singer  and I took the sound of his voice in my computer  and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you're about to hear. And I'll perform just an excerpt of  Aphasia  for you here. Okay  So that gives you a little taste of that piece.  Applause  Yeah  okay  that's kind of weird stuff. Is it music  Here's how I want to conclude. I've decided  ultimately  that this is the wrong question  that this is not the important question. The important question is   Is it interesting   And I follow this question  not worrying about  Is it music      not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making. I allow my creativity to push me in directions that are simply interesting to me  and I don't worry about the likeness of the result to some notion  some paradigm  of what music composition is supposed to be  and that has actually urged me  in a sense  to take on a whole bunch of different roles  and so what I want you to think about is  to what extent might you change the fundamental question in your discipline  and  okay  I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here  because  like  I realized I mentioned some psychological defects earlier  and we also  along the way  had a fair amount of obsessive behavior  and there was some delusional behavior and things like that  and here I think we could say that this is an argument for self loathing and a kind of schizophrenia  at least in the popular use of the term  and I really mean dissociative identity disorder  okay.  Laughter  Anyway  despite those perils  I would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work  whether they are neighboring or far flung from your professional definition. And with that  I thank you very much.  Applause  In half a century of trying to help prevent wars  there's one question that never leaves me  How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return  When you're faced with brutality  whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence    or  on the streets of Syria today  facing tanks and shrapnel  what's the most effective thing to do  Fight back  Give in  Use more force  This question   How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return   has been with me ever since I was a child. I remember I was about     glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest  and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down. And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase. And my mother came up and said   What on Earth are you doing   And I said   I'm going to Budapest.  And she said   What on Earth for   And I said   Kids are getting killed there. There's something terrible happening.  And she said   Don't be so silly.  And I started to cry. And she got it  she said   Okay  I see it's serious. You're much too young to help. You need training. I'll help you. But just unpack your suitcase.  And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my   s. But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn't get from training courses. I wanted to understand how violence  how oppression  works. And what I've discovered since is this  Bullies use violence in three ways. They use political violence to intimidate  physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine. And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence. Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence  and    years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills  the incredible skills  that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy. And they did it in a total devotion to non violence. They realized that using force against force doesn't work. So what does work  Over time I've collected about a half dozen methods that do work    of course there are many more    that do work and that are effective. And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here  inside me. It's my response  my attitude  to oppression that I've got control over  and that I can do something about. And what I need to develop is self knowledge to do that. That means I need to know how I tick  when I collapse  where my formidable points are  where my weaker points are. When do I give in  What will I stand up for  And meditation or self inspection is one of the ways    again it's not the only one    it's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power. And my heroine here    like Satish's    is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma. She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon. They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns. And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her. But she told the students to sit down. And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun  put her hand on it and lower it. And no one got killed. So that's what the mastery of fear can do    not only faced with machine guns  but if you meet a knife fight in the street. But we have to practice. So what about our fear  I have a little mantra. My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it. And if it grows very big it probably happens. So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome  when something you've been worrying about wakes you up    I see a lot of people    and for an hour you toss and turn  it gets worse and worse  and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big. The only thing to do is to get up  make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you. You're the adult. The fear is the child. And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants  what it needs. How can this be made better  How can the child feel stronger  And you make a plan. And you say   Okay  now we're going back to sleep. Half past seven  we're getting up and that's what we're going to do.  I had one of these   a.m. episodes on Sunday    paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you. So I did the thing. I got up  made the cup of tea  sat down with it  did it all and I'm here    still partly paralyzed  but I'm here. So that's fear. What about anger  Wherever there is injustice there's anger. But anger is like gasoline  and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match  you've got an inferno. But anger as an engine    in an engine    is powerful. If we can put our anger inside an engine  it can drive us forward  it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power. And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers. Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong. Totally ineffective. In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger. It's okay to be angry with the thing    the nuclear weapons in this case    but it is hopeless to be angry with the people. They are human beings just like us. And they're doing what they think is best. And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them. So that's the third one  anger. And it brings me to the crux of what's going on  or what I perceive as going on  in the world today  which is that last century was top down power. It was still governments telling people what to do. This century there's a shift. It's bottom up or grassroots power. It's like mushrooms coming through concrete. It's people joining up with people  as Bundy just said  miles away to bring about change. And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do. They know best what to do. So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that. And the kind of thing they're doing is demobilizing militias  rebuilding economies  resettling refugees  even liberating child soldiers. And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this. And what they've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane  but it's less effective than using methods that connect people with people  that rebuild. And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this. Up to now their counter terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost  and if civilians get in the way  that's written as  collateral damage.  And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan  that it makes the recruitment for al Qaeda very easy  when people are so disgusted by  for example  the burning of the Koran. So the training of the troops has to change. And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change. The British military have always been much better at this. But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from  and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes. And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf    in Iraq actually    and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road  screaming  yelling  furiously angry  and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified  didn't know what was going on  couldn't speak Arabic. And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head  pointing at the ground  and he said   Kneel.  And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor  wobbled to the ground. And complete silence fell. And after about two minutes  everybody moved aside and went home. Now that to me is wisdom in action. In the moment  that's what he did. And it's happening everywhere now. You don't believe me  Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last    years  Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia  East Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Mali  Madagascar  Poland  the Philippines  Serbia  Slovenia  I could go on  and now Tunisia and Egypt. And this hasn't just happened. A lot of it is due to a book written by an    year old man in Boston  Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called  From Dictatorship to Democracy  with    methodologies for non violent resistance. And it's been translated into    languages. It's flown around the world. And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere  because it works and it's effective. So this is what gives me hope    not just hope  this is what makes me feel very positive right now. Because finally human beings are getting it. We're getting practical  doable methodologies to answer my question  How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug  We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined  inner power    the development of inner power    through self knowledge  recognizing and working with our fear  using anger as a fuel  cooperating with others  banding together with others  courage  and most importantly  commitment to active non violence. Now I don't just believe in non violence. I don't have to believe in it. I see evidence everywhere of how it works. And I see that we  ordinary people  can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did. We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known. And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve. And this open heartedness is exactly what I've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday. Thank you. In Oxford in the     s  there was a fantastic doctor  who was very unusual  named Alice Stewart. And Alice was unusual partly because  of course  she was a woman  which was pretty rare in the     s. And she was brilliant  she was one of the  at the time  the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians. She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married  after she had kids  and even after she got divorced and was a single parent  she continued her medical work. And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science  the emerging field of epidemiology  the study of patterns in disease. But like every scientist  she appreciated that to make her mark  what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it. The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers. Most disease is correlated with poverty  but in the case of childhood cancers  the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families. So  what  she wanted to know  could explain this anomaly  Now  Alice had trouble getting funding for her research. In the end  she got just       pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize. And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data. Now  she had no idea what to look for. This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search  so she asked everything she could think of. Had the children eaten boiled sweets  Had they consumed colored drinks  Did they eat fish and chips  Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing  What time of life had they started school  And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back  one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of. By a rate of two to one  the children who had died had had mothers who had been X rayed when pregnant. Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point  a threshold. It flew in the face of conventional wisdom  which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age  which was the X ray machine. And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves  which was as people who helped patients  they didn't harm them. Nevertheless  Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in     . People got very excited  there was talk of the Nobel Prize  and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared. In fact  she need not have hurried. It was fully    years before the British and medical    British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X raying pregnant women. The data was out there  it was open  it was freely available  but nobody wanted to know. A child a week was dying  but nothing changed. Openness alone can't drive change. So for    years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands. So  how did she know that she was right  Well  she had a fantastic model for thinking. She worked with a statistician named George Kneale  and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't. So  Alice was very outgoing and sociable  and George was a recluse. Alice was very warm  very empathetic with her patients. George frankly preferred numbers to people. But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship. He said   My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong.  He actively sought disconfirmation. Different ways of looking at her models  at her statistics  different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her. He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories. Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong  that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right. It's a fantastic model of collaboration    thinking partners who aren't echo chambers. I wonder how many of us have  or dare to have  such collaborators. Alice and George were very good at conflict. They saw it as thinking. So what does that kind of constructive conflict require  Well  first of all  it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves. That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive  which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves  and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds  different disciplines  different ways of thinking and different experience  and find ways to engage with them. That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy. And the more I've thought about this  the more I think  really  that that's a kind of love. Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy and time if you don't really care. And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds. Alice's daughter told me that every time Alice went head to head with a fellow scientist  they made her think and think and think again.  My mother   she said   My mother didn't enjoy a fight  but she was really good at them.  So it's one thing to do that in a one to one relationship. But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face  many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced  mostly haven't come from individuals  they've come from organizations  some of them bigger than countries  many of them capable of affecting hundreds  thousands  even millions of lives. So how do organizations think  Well  for the most part  they don't. And that isn't because they don't want to  it's really because they can't. And they can't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict. In surveys of European and American executives  fully    percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise. Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke  afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage  and felt that they were bound to lose. Eighty five percent is a really big number. It means that organizations mostly can't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did. They can't think together. And it means that people like many of us  who have run organizations  and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can  mostly fail to get the best out of them. So how do we develop the skills that we need  Because it does take skill and practice  too. If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict  we have to see it as thinking  and then we have to get really good at it. So  recently  I worked with an executive named Joe  and Joe worked for a medical device company. And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on. He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people. He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help. But when he looked around his organization  nobody else seemed to be at all worried. So  he didn't really want to say anything. After all  maybe they knew something he didn't. Maybe he'd look stupid. But he kept worrying about it  and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved. In the end  Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns. And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation. It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts. So now Joe had allies. They could think together. And yes  there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument  but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative  to solve the problem  and to change the device. Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle blower  except that like almost all whistle blowers  he wasn't a crank at all  he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served. But he had been so afraid of conflict  until finally he became more afraid of the silence. And when he dared to speak  he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined. And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank. They think of him as a leader. So  how do we have these conversations more easily and more often  Well  the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend. It doesn't really matter what the statements are about  what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority. I think it's a fantastic system  but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people  and way too late in life. I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development  if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society. The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden. It comes from information that is freely available and out there  but that we are willfully blind to  because we can't handle  don't want to handle  the conflict that it provokes. But when we dare to break that silence  or when we dare to see  and we create conflict  we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking. Open information is fantastic  open networks are essential. But the truth won't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it. Openness isn't the end. It's the beginning. So  well  I do applied math  and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math  is that we are like management consultants. No one knows what the hell we do. So I am going to give you some    attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. So  dancing is one of the most human of activities. We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. Now  ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill  and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. Now  sadly  neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling  who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. However  there are  .  million people worldwide who have the disease  and they have to live with incurable weakness  tremor  rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease  so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. We need to be able to measure progression objectively  and ultimately  the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. But frustratingly  with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders  there are no biomarkers  so there's no simple blood test that you can do  and the best that we have is like this    minute neurologist test. You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very  very costly  and that means that  outside the clinical trials  it's just never done. It's never done. But what if patients could do this test at home  Now  that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic  and what if patients could do that test themselves  right  No expensive staff time required. Takes about       by the way  in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this  because  you see  in one sense  at least  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. Now  this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds  and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP   for example. And like ballet  it takes an extraordinary level of training. I mean  just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. From the sound  we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's  so too are the vocal organs. So on the bottom trace  you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. We see all the same symptoms. We see vocal tremor  weakness and rigidity. The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while  and that's one of the example symptoms of it. So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle  in some cases  but with any digital microphone  and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning  which is very advanced by now  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. So these voice based tests  how do they stack up against expert clinical tests  We'll  they're both non invasive. The neurologist's test is non invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. And they're both accurate. Okay  but in addition  voice based tests are non expert. That means they can be self administered. They're high speed  take about    seconds at most. They're ultra low cost  and we all know what happens. When something becomes ultra low cost  it becomes massively scalable. So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. We can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data. We can perform low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials  and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time. We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. So  taking the first steps towards this today  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe  we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in  cheaply  and leave recordings  a few cents each  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. Thank you.  Applause  Tom Rielly  So Max  by taking all these samples of  let's say         people  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not  What are you going to get out of those samples  Max Little  Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that  during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not  you see. TR  Right. ML  You see  some people may not do it. They may not get through it. But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances  and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors  and looking for the actual markers of the disease. TR  So you're    percent accurate right now  ML  It's much better than that. Actually  my student Thanasis  I have to plug him  because he's done some fantastic work  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well  which enables this project  and we're getting    percent accuracy. TR  Ninety nine. Well  that's an improvement. So what that means is that people will be able to   ML   Laughs  TR  People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test  and people with Parkinson's could call in  record their voice  and then their doctor can check up on their progress  see where they're doing in this course of the disease. ML  Absolutely. TR  Thanks so much. Max Little  everybody. ML  Thanks  Tom.  Applause  The will to live life differently can start in some of the most unusual places. This is where I come from  Todmorden. It's a market town in the north of England         people  between Leeds and Manchester  fairly normal market town. It used to look like this  and now it's more like this  with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place. We call it propaganda gardening.  Laughter  Corner row railway  station car park  front of a health center  people's front gardens  and even in front of the police station.  Laughter  We've got edible canal towpaths  and we've got sprouting cemeteries. The soil is extremely good.  Laughter  We've even invented a new form of tourism. It's called vegetable tourism  and believe it or not  people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds  even when there's not much growing.  Laughter  But it starts a conversation.  Laughter  And  you know  we're not doing it because we're bored.  Laughter  We're doing it because we want to start a revolution. We tried to answer this simple question  Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living  see spaces around them differently  think about the resources they use differently  interact differently  Can we find that language  And then  can we replicate those actions  And the answer would appear to be yes  and the language would appear to be food. So  three and a half years ago  a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing.  Laughter  We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting. We did not consult. We did not write a report. Enough of all that.  Laughter  And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden  look  let's imagine that our town is focused around three plates  a community plate  the way we live our everyday lives  a learning plate  what we teach our kids in school and what new skills we share amongst ourselves  and business  what we do with the pound in our pocket and which businesses we choose to support. Now  let's imagine those plates agitated with community actions around food. If we start one of those community plates spinning  that's really great  that really starts to empower people  but if we can then spin that community plate with the learning plate  and then spin it with the business plate  we've got a real show there  we've got some action theater. We're starting to build resilience ourselves. We're starting to reinvent community ourselves  and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document. And here's the thing as well. We've not asked anybody's permission to do this  we're just doing it.  Laughter  And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start  and most importantly of all  we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say   These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems   because I have seen the power of small actions  and it is awesome. So  back to the public meeting.  Laughter  We put that proposition to the meeting  two seconds  and then the room exploded. I have never  ever experienced anything like that in my life. And it's been the same in every single room  in every town that we've ever told our story. People are ready and respond to the story of food. They want positive actions they can engage in  and in their bones  they know it's time to take personal responsibility and invest in more kindness to each other and to the environment. And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago  it's been a heck of a roller coaster. We started with a seed swap  really simple stuff  and then we took an area of land  a strip on the side of our main road  which was a dog toilet  basically  and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden. We took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw  and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves. We went to the doctors. We've just had a   million pound health center built in Todmorden  and for some reason that I cannot comprehend  it has been surrounded by prickly plants.  Laughter  So we went to the doctors  said   Would you mind us taking them up   They said   Absolutely fine  provided you get planning permission and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate   so we did    Laughter    and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor's surgery. And there's been lots of other examples  like the corn that was in front of the police station  and the old people's home that we've planted it with food that they can pick and grow. But it isn't just about growing  because we all are part of this jigsaw. It's about taking those artistic people in your community and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds to explain to people what's growing there  because there's so many people that don't really recognize a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic with a bit of an instruction packet on the top.  Laughter  So we have some people who designed these things   If it looks like this  please don't pick it  but if it looks like this  help yourself.  This is about sharing and investing in kindness. And for those people that don't want to do either of those things  maybe they can cook  so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street  or in the pub  or in the church  or wherever people are living their lives. This is about us going to the people and saying   We are all part of the local food jigsaw  we are all part of a solution.  And then  because we know we've got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic  we thought  what could we do to give them an even better experience  So we invented  without asking  of course  the Incredible Edible Green Route. And this is a route of exhibition gardens  and edible towpaths  and bee friendly sites  and the story of pollinators  and it's a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town  past our cafes and our small shops  through our market  not just to and fro from the supermarket  and we're hoping that  in changing people's footfall around our town  we're also changing their behavior. And then there's the second plate  the learning plate. Well  we're in partnership with a high school. We've created a company. We are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school  like you do  and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees  and the kids are helping us build that  and the kids are on the board  and because the community was really keen on working with the high school  the high school is now teaching agriculture  and because it's teaching agriculture  we started to think  how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing  how can we give them some more experience  So we got some land that was donated by a local garden center. It was really quite muddy  but in a truly incredible way  totally voluntary led  we have turned that into a market garden training center  and that is polytunnels and raised beds and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future. And because we were doing that  some local academics said   You know  we could help design a commercial horticulture course for you. There's not one that we know of.  So they're doing that  and we're going to launch it later this year  and it's all an experiment  and it's all voluntary. And then there's the third plate  because if you walk through an edible landscape  and if you're learning new skills  and if you start to get interested in what's growing seasonally  you might just want to spend more of your own money in support of local producers  not just veg  but meat and cheese and beer and whatever else it might be. But then  we're just a community group  you know. We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do  So we did some really simple things. We fundraised  we got some blackboards  we put  Incredible Edible  on the top  we gave it every market trader that was selling locally  and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week. Really popular. People congregated around it. Sales were up. And then  we had a chat with the farmers  and we said   We're really serious about this   but they didn't actually believe us  so we thought  okay  what should we do  I know. If we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product  maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious. So we launched a campaign    because it just amuses me    called Every Egg Matters.  Laughter  And what we did was we put people on our egg map. It's a stylized map of Togmorden. Anybody that's selling their excess eggs at the garden gate  perfectly legally  to their neighbors  we've stuck on there. We started with four  and we've now got    on  and the result of that was that people were then going into shops asking for a local Todmorden egg  and the result of that was  some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got of free range birds  and then they went on to meat birds  and although these are really  really small steps  that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways  and we now have farmers doing cheese and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs  they're doing pasties and pies and things that they would have never done before. We've got increasing market stalls selling local food  and in a survey that local students did for us     percent of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line had increased because of what we were actually doing. And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment. Now  none of this is rocket science. It certainly is not clever  and it's not original. But it is joined up  and it is inclusive. This is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway. This is a movement for everyone. We have a motto  If you eat  you're in.  Laughter  Across age  across income  across culture. It's been really quite a roller coaster experience  but going back to that first question that we asked  is it replicable  Yeah. It most certainly is replicable. More than    towns in England now are spinning the Incredible Edible plate. Whichever way they want to do it  of their own volition  they're trying to make their own lives differently  and worldwide  we've got communities across America and Japan    it's incredible  isn't it  I mean  America and Japan and New Zealand. People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness around local growing into the heart of Christchurch. And none of this takes more money and none of this demands a bureaucracy  but it does demand that you think things differently and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs in order to create that supportive framework that communities can bounce off. And there's some great ideas already in our patch. Our local authority has decided to make everywhere Incredible Edible  and in support of that have decided to do two things. First  they're going to create an asset register of spare land that they've got  put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live  and they're going to underpin that with a license. And then they've said to every single one of their workforce  if you can  help those communities grow  and help them to maintain their spaces. Suddenly  we're seeing actions on the ground from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed. We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded of us  and there's lots more you could do. I mean  just to list a few. One  please stop putting prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space. edible landscapes so that our children start to walk past their food day in  day out  on our high streets  in our parks  wherever that might be. Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart of the town and the city plan  not relegate them to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see. Encourage all our schools to take this seriously. This isn't a second class exercise. If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow  then please let us say to every school  create a sense of purpose around the importance to the environment  local food and soils. Put that at the heart of your school culture  and you will create a different generation. There are so many things you can do  but ultimately this is about something really simple. Through an organic process  through an increasing recognition of the power of small actions  we are starting  at last  to believe in ourselves again  and to believe in our capacity  each and every one of us  to build a different and a kinder future  and in my book  that's incredible. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  We're going to begin in     . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his career is just reaching its pinnacle. He's been christened the voice of a generation  and he's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate  but there's a small minority of dissenters  and they claim that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.     . Brian Burton  aka Danger Mouse  takes the Beatles'  White Album   combines it with Jay Z's  The Black Album  to create  The Grey Album.   The Grey Album  becomes an immediate sensation online  and the Beatles' record company sends out countless cease and desist letters for  unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property.  Now   The Grey Album  is a remix. It is new media created from old media. It was made using these three techniques  copy  transform and combine. It's how you remix. You take existing songs  you chop them up  you transform the pieces  you combine them back together again  and you've got a new song  but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs. But I think these aren't just the components of remixing. I think these are the basic elements of all creativity. I think everything is a remix  and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity. All right  let's head back to       and let's hear where some of Dylan's early songs came from. We'll do some side by side comparisons here. All right  this first song you're going to hear is  Nottamun Town.  It's a traditional folk tune. After that  you'll hear Dylan's  Masters of War.  Jean Ritchie    In Nottamun Town  not a soul would look out      not a soul would look up  not a soul would look down.   Bob Dylan    Come you masters of war      you that build the big guns  you that build the death planes      You that build all the bombs.   Kirby Ferguson  Okay  so that's the same basic melody and overall structure. This next one is  The Patriot Game   by Dominic Behan. Alongside that  you're going to hear  With God on Our Side   by Dylan. Dominic Behan    Come all ye young rebels      and list while I sing      for the love of one's land is a terrible thing.   BD    Oh my name it is nothin'      my age it means less      the country I come from is called the Midwest.   KF  Okay  so in this case  Dylan admits he must have heard  The Patriot Game   he forgot about it  then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain  he just thought it was his song. Last one  this is  Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons   another traditional folk tune. Alongside that is  Don't Think Twice  It's All Right.  This one's more about the lyric. Paul Clayton    It ain't no use to sit and sigh now      darlin'  and it ain't no use to sit and cry now.   BD    It ain t no use to sit and wonder why  babe      if you don't know by now      and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why  babe      it'll never do somehow.   KF  Okay  now  there's a lot of these. It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed. This is pretty typical among folk singers. Here's the advice of Dylan's idol  Woody Guthrie.  The worlds are the important thing. Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune  sing high when they sing low  sing fast when they sing slow  and you've got a new tune.  And that's  that's what Guthrie did right here  and I'm sure you all recognize the results. We know this tune  right  We know it  Actually you don't. That is  When the World's on Fire   a very old melody  in this case performed by the Carter Family. Guthrie adapted it into  This Land Is Your Land.  So  Bob Dylan  like all folk singers  he copied melodies  he transformed them  he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff. Now  American copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others. Instead  these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property. Now  creative works may indeed be kind of like property  but it's property that we're all building on  and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared. Henry Ford once said   I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable.      . The iPhone makes it debut. Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early  but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades. That's multi touch  controlling a device by touching its display. Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke. Steve Jobs  And we have invented a new technology called multi touch. You can do multi fingered gestures on it  and boy have we patented it.  Laughter  KF  Yes. And yet  here is multi touch in action. This is at TED  actually  about a year earlier. This is Jeff Han  and  I mean  that's multi touch. It's the same animal  at least. Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this newfangled technology. Jeff Han  Multi touch sensing isn't anything    isn't completely new. I mean  people like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '  s. The technology  you know  isn't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility. KF  So he's pretty frank about it not being new. So it's not multi touch as a whole that's patented. It's the small parts of it that are  and it's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent  to promote the progress of useful arts. Here is the first ever slide to unlock. That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this. It's a    page software patent  but I will summarize what it covers. Spoiler alert  Unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger.  Laughter  I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent. Now  can someone own this idea  Now  back in the '  s  there were no software patents  and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface. What if they had patented pop up menus  scrollbars  the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper  Would a young and inexperienced Apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like Xerox  Now  this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you're the one getting remixed. For example ... SJ  I mean  Picasso had a saying. He said   Good artists copy. Great artists steal.  And we have  you know  always been shameless about stealing great ideas. KF  Okay  so that's in '  . Here's in     .  I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.   I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.   Laughter  Okay  so in other words  great artists steal  but not from me. Now  behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion We have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours. We have no such aversion towards copying what other people have  because we do that nonstop. So here's the sort of equation we're looking at. We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property  plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases  plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court  plus cognitive biases against perceived loss. And the sum looks like this. That is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones. Is this promoting the progress of useful arts      . Bob Dylan is    years old  and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past. He records a song called  Blind Willie McTell   named after the blues singer  and the song is a voyage through the past  through a much darker time  but a simpler one  a time when musicians like Willie McTell had few illusions about what they did.  I jump 'em from other writers but I arrange 'em my own way.  I think this is mostly what we do. Our creativity comes from without  not from within. We are not self made. We are dependent on one another  and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness. It's a liberation from our misconceptions  and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin. Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause  One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is  snollygoster.  Just because it sounds so good. And what snollygoster means is  a dishonest politician.  Although there was a   th century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said   A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party  platform or principle  and who  when he wins  gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy.  Now I have no idea what  talknophical  is. Something to do with words  I assume. But it's very important that words are at the center of politics  and all politicians know they have to try and control language. It wasn't until  for example       that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby  who took on Parliament. And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned  but he was brave enough  he was brave enough to take them on  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  as bold as brass.  Most people think that's down to the metal. It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. But to really show you how words and politics interact  I want to take you back to the United States of America  just after they'd achieved independence. And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington  their leader. They didn't know. What do you call the leader of a republican country  And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table  which might have made it. I mean  some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington  and other people  His Highness George Washington  and other people  Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. Not that catchy. Some people just wanted to call him King. They thought it was tried and tested. And they weren't even being monarchical there  they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. And  you know  it could have worked. And everybody got insanely bored  actually  because this debate went on for three weeks. I read a diary of this poor senator  who just keeps coming back   Still on this subject.  And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas  or his successor ideas. So they wanted to give him the humblest  meagerest  most pathetic title that they could think of. And that title was  President.  President. They didn't invent the title. I mean  it existed before  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. It was like the foreman of the jury. And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term  foreman  or  overseer.  There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government  but it was really a nothing title. And that's why the Senate objected to it. They said  that's ridiculous  you can't call him President. This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America  And after three weeks of debate  in the end the Senate did not cave in. Instead  they agreed to use the title  President  for now  but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government  whose custom it is to annex  through the office of the Chief Magistrate  titles of respectability    not bloody President    and that in the intercourse with foreign nations  the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity  i.e.  we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. Now you can learn three interesting things from this. First of all    and this is my favorite    is that so far as I've ever been able to find out  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. Barack Obama  President Obama  is there on borrowed time  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure    you can still be waiting     years later. But the third thing you can learn  and this is the really important one  this is the point I want to leave you on  is that the title  President of the United States of America  doesn't sound that humble at all these days  does it  Something to do with the slightly over       nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. And so the Senate won in the end. They got their title of respectability. And also  the Senate's other worry  the appearance of singularity    well  it was a singularity back then. But now  do you know how many nations have a president  A hundred and forty seven. All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the       nuclear warheads  etc. And so  in the end  the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost  because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. And that's the important lesson I think you can take away  and the one I want to leave you with. Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality  but in fact  reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. Thank you very much. I'm     feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. The air is thick with heat and dust  and it's hard to breathe. I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness  but I can't see much else. I hear voices talking  but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing  and stone being broken with primitive tools. Like the others  I wear a flickering  cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic  tattered band  and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth. When my hand slips  I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft. As I stand talking to you today  these men are still deep in that hole  risking their lives without payment or compensation  and often dying. I got to climb out of that hole  and I got to go home  but they likely never will  because they're trapped in slavery. For the last    years  I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than    countries on six continents  and in      I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. Amongst all the astonishing people I met there  I met a supporter of Free the Slaves  an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery. We started talking about slavery  and really  I started learning about slavery  for I had certainly known it existed in the world  but not to such a degree. After we finished talking  I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime  and I thought  if I don't know  how many other people don't know  It started burning a hole in my stomach  so within weeks  I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. Thus began my journey into modern day slavery. Oddly  I had been to many of these places before. Some I even considered like my second home. But this time  I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet. A conservative estimate tells us there are more than    million people enslaved in the world today. That's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans Atlantic slave trade. A hundred and fifty years ago  an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker. That equates to about         in today's money. Yet today  entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as    . Astonishingly  slavery generates profits of more than     billion worldwide each year. Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education  a better job  only to find that they're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence  and they cannot walk away. Today's slavery is about commerce  so the goods that enslaved people produce have value  but the people producing them are disposable. Slavery exists everywhere  nearly  in the world  and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world. In India and Nepal  I was introduced to the brick kilns. This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno. Enveloped in temperatures of     degrees  men  women  children  entire families in fact  were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust  while mechanically stacking bricks on their head  up to    at a time  and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away. Deadened by monotony and exhaustion  they work silently  doing this task over and over for    or    hours a day. There were no breaks for food  no water breaks  and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential. So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working. Every    minutes  I'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it  and as I sat there  I thought  my camera is getting far better treatment than these people. Back in the kilns  I wanted to cry  but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said   Lisa  don't do that. Just don't do that here.  And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this  not just for me  but for them. I couldn't offer them any direct help. I couldn't give them money  nothing. I wasn't a citizen of that country. I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in. I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation  and I trusted that they would. As for me  I'd have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak. In the Himalayas  I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below. The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them  and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth. It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming. How can we affect something so insidious  yet so pervasive  Some don't even know they're enslaved  people working        hours a day without any pay  because this has been the case all their lives. They have nothing to compare it to. When these villagers claimed their freedom  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses. I mean  these people had nothing  and they were so petrified  they wanted to give up  but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere  and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own  so that now they do the same back breaking work  but they do it for themselves  and they get paid for it  and they do it in freedom. Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery  and because of this worldwide awareness  I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. In Kathmandu  I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves. They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty  dimly fluorescent lit basement. This wasn't a brothel  per se. It was more like a restaurant. Cabin restaurants  as they're known in the trade  are venues for forced prostitution. Each has small  private rooms  where the slaves  women  along with young girls and boys  some as young as seven years old  are forced to entertain the clients  encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. Each cubicle is dark and dingy  identified with a painted number on the wall  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers. Standing in the near darkness  I remember feeling this quick  hot fear  and in that instant  I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell. I had only one way out  the stairs from where I'd come in. There were no back doors. There were no windows large enough to climb through. These people have no escape at all  and as we take in such a difficult subject  it's important to note that slavery  including sex trafficking  occurs in our own backyard as well. Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture  in restaurants  in domestic servitude  and the list can go on. Recently  the New York Times reported that between         and         American children are sold into sex slavery every year. It's all around us. We just don't see it. The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor. I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade. This is a family portrait. The dyed black hands are the father  while the blue and red hands are his sons. They mix dye in these big barrels  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows  but the dye is toxic. My interpreter told me their stories.  We have no freedom   they said.  We hope still  though  that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing.  It's estimated that more than       children are enslaved on Lake Volta  the largest man made lake in the world. When we first arrived  I went to have a quick look. I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat  two older brothers  some younger kids  makes sense right  Wrong. They were all enslaved. Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished  and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake  even though they do not know how to swim. This young child is eight years old. He was trembling when our boat approached  frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. He was petrified he would be knocked in the water. The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets  and weary  frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines. Many of them drown. For as long as he can recall  he's been forced to work on the lake. Terrified of his master  he will not run away  and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life  he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages. I met these boys at five in the morning  when they were hauling in the last of their nets  but they had been working since   a.m. in the cold  windy night. And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. I want to introduce you to Kofi. Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery. Here he's seen taking a bath at the well  pouring big buckets of water over his head  and the wonderful news is  as you and I are sitting here talking today  Kofi has been reunited with his family  and what's even better  his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe. Kofi is the embodiment of possibility. Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life  Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves  a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window. He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle. At the end of the road  he urged us out of the car  and told the driver to quickly leave. Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath  and said   This is the path  this is the path. Go.  As we started down the path  we pushed aside the vines blocking the way  and after about an hour of walking in  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest. After another two hours of hiking  the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing  and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field  and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold  wading in water poisoned by mercury. Mercury is used in the extraction process. These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana. When they came out of the shaft  they were soaking wet from their own sweat. I remember looking into their tired  bloodshot eyes  for many of them had been underground for    hours. The shafts are up to     feet deep  and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area  where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold. At first glance  the pounding site seems full of powerful men  but when we look closer  we see some less fortunate working on the fringes  and children too. All of them are victim to injury  illness and violence. In fact  it's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here  racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years. This is Manuru. When his father died  his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines. When his uncle died  Manuru inherited his uncle's debt  which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. When I met him  he had been working in the mines for    years  and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident  one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated. On top of that  Manuru has tuberculosis  yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft. Even still  he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves  and it's this sort of determination  in the face of unimaginable odds  that fills me with complete awe. I want to shine a light on slavery. When I was working in the field  I brought lots of candles with me  and with the help of my interpreter  I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight  so when it was safe for them  and safe for me  I made these images. They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world. I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them  and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives. I truly believe  if we can see one another as fellow human beings  then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery. These images are not of issues. They are of people  real people  like you and me  all deserving of the same rights  dignity and respect in their lives. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful  mistreated people I've had the tremendous honor of meeting. I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them  people like you  and I hope that force will ignite a fire  and that fire will shine a light on slavery  for without that light  the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows. Thank you very much. I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers you hope you're not going to meet at TED. First  I don't have a mobile  so I'm on the safe side. Secondly  a political theorist who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about. And plus  I'm not going to give you any answers. I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about. And one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions. There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me. You people  the Church of TED  are a very optimistic community. Basically you believe in complexity  but not in ambiguity. As you have been told  I'm Bulgarian. And according to the surveys  we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world. The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness  and the title was  The Happy  the Unhappy and the Bulgarians.  So now when you know what to expect  let's give you the story. And this is a rainy election day in a small country    that can be my country  but could be also your country. And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon  nobody went to the polling stations. But then the rain stopped  people went to vote. And when the votes had been counted  three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot. The government and the opposition  they have been simply paralyzed. Because you know what to do about the protests. You know who to arrest  who to negotiate with. But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot  So the government decided to have the elections once again. And this time even a greater number     percent of the people  voted with blank ballots. Basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for. This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called  Seeing.  But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days. On one level nobody's questioning that democracy is the best form of government. Democracy is the only game in town. The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing. For the last    years  political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout  and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting. I mean the unemployed  the under privileged. And this is a major issue. Because especially now with the economic crisis  you can see that the trust in politics  that the trust in democratic institutions  was really destroyed. According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission     percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy makers and the opinion of the public. Only    percent of Italians and    percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters. Basically people start to understand that they can change governments  but they cannot change policies. And the question which I want to ask is the following  How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before    we have more rights  we can travel easier  we have access to more information    at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed  So basically I want to ask  What went right and what went wrong in these    years when we talk about democracy  And I'll start with what went right. And the first thing that went right was  of course  these five revolutions which  in my view  very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience. And the first was the cultural and social revolution of      and     s  which put the individual at the center of politics. It was the human rights moment. Basically this was also a major outbreak  a culture of dissent  a culture of basically non conformism  which was not known before. So I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '      nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then. But after that you have the market revolution of the     s. And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it  the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message   The government does not know better.  And you have more choice driven societies. And of course  you have         the end of Communism  the end of the Cold War. And it was the birth of the global world. And you have the Internet. And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people. It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics. The very idea of political community totally has changed. And I'm going to name one more revolution  and this is the revolution in brain sciences  which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions. So this is what went right. But if we're going to see what went wrong  we're going to end up with the same five revolutions. Because first you have the     s and     s  cultural and social revolution  which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose. The very idea  all these collective nouns that we have been taught about    nation  class  family. We start to like divorcing  if we're married at all. All this was very much under attack. And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand. And you have the market revolution of the     s and the huge increase of inequality in societies. Remember  until the     s  the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality. The more democratic our societies have been  the more equal they have been becoming. Now we have the reverse tendency. The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality. And I find this very much disturbing when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong with democracy these days. And if you go to         something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize    but many are going to tell you   Listen  it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe.  When the Soviet Union was still there  the rich and the powerful  they needed the people  because they feared them. Now the elites basically have been liberated. They're very mobile. You cannot tax them. And basically they don't fear the people. So as a result of it  you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters. So this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore. And when we talk about the Internet  yes  it's true  the Internet connected all of us  but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to. And it's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you. I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation  but  have you  seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days  This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution. This is the other side of the things that we like. And when you go to the brain sciences  what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don't talk to me about ideas anymore  don't talk to me about policy programs. What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people. And you have this very strongly to the extent that  even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days  these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas. Before  revolutions used to have ideological names. They could be communist  they could be liberal  they could be fascist or Islamic. Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used. You have Facebook revolutions  Twitter revolutions. The content doesn't matter anymore  the problem is the media. I'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong. And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation  when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy  we should keep this ambiguity in mind. Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most. These days it's very popular to believe that this push for transparency  this kind of a combination between active citizens  new technologies and much more transparency friendly legislation can restore trust in politics. You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this  it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie  it's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill. This is probably true. But I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is   It's transparency  stupid.  Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions. Transparency is politics' management of mistrust. We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust. And by the way  mistrust was always very important for democracy. This is why you have checks and balances. This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent. But when politics is only management of mistrust  then    I'm very glad that        has been mentioned    now we're going to have        in reverse. It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you  it's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class. But is this the idea of a free society  For example  can you imagine that decent  civic  talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust  Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues  are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions  even the very wrong positions  because consistency is going to be more important than common sense  And the Americans who are in the room  are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections  I find this extremely important  because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions. And we can lose this with the very noble idea to keep people accountable for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics. So for me this is extremely important. And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days  probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story. But also don't forget  any unveiling is also veiling.  Regardless of  how transparent our governments want to be  they're going to be selectively transparent. In a small country that could be my country  but could be also your country  they took a decision    it is a real case story    that all of the governmental decisions  discussions of the council of ministers  were going to be published on the Internet    hours after the council discussions took place. And the public was extremely all for it. So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister  why he made this decision. He said   Listen  this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed. Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that    hours after this is going to be on the public space  and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis.  So when we talk about transparency  when we talk about openness  I really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong. And this is Goethe  who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist  some centuries ago he said   There is a big shadow where there is much light.  Thank you very much. ... pulling trees from the ground  shattering windows  taking the roofs off of homes ... Caitria O'Neill  That was me in front of our house in Monson  Massachusetts last June. After an EF  tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off  I decided to stay in Massachusetts  instead of pursuing the master's program I had moved my boxes home that afternoon for. Morgan O'Neill  So  on June    we weren't disaster experts  but on June    we started faking it. This experience changed our lives  and now we're trying to change the experience. CO  So  tornadoes don't happen in Massachusetts  and I was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill. After a lamppost flew by  my family and I sprinted into the basement. Trees were thrown against the house  the windows exploded. When we finally got out the back door  transformers were burning in the street. MO  I was here in Boston. I'm a PhD student at MIT  and I happen to study atmospheric science. Actually  it gets weirder    I was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit  playing with the tornado display    so I missed her call. I get a call from Caitria  hear the news  and start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area. I drove home late that night with batteries and ice. We live across the street from a historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm. It had become a community gathering place overnight. The town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits  and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church. CO  We walked to the church because we heard they had hot meals  but when we arrived  we found problems. There were a couple large  sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church  but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet. As we watched  they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own. MO  So we started organizing. Why  It had to be done. We found Pastor Bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure. And then  armed with just two laptops and one air card  we built a recovery machine. CO  That was a tornado  and everyone's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer. MO  Everyone's donating clothing. We should inventory the donations piling up here. CO  And we need a hotline. Can you make a Google Voice number  MO  Sure. And we need to tell people what not to bring. I'll make a Facebook account. Can you print flyers  CO  Yeah  but we don't even know what houses are accepting help. We need to canvas and send out volunteers. MO  We need to tell people what not to bring. Hey  there's a news truck. I'll tell them. CO  You got my number off the news  We don't need more freezers  Together  Someone get me Post its  CO  And then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers. MO  I can donate three water heaters  but someone needs to come pick them up. CO  My car is in my living room  MO  My boyscout troop would like to rebuild    mailboxes. CO  My puppy is missing and insurance doesn't cover chimneys. MO  My church group of    would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties. CO  You sent me to that place on Washington Street yesterday  and now I'm covered in poison ivy. So this is what filled our days. We had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in a minute or less  otherwise  something more urgent would come up  and it wouldn't get done. MO  We didn't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the United Way. We just started answering questions and making decisions because someone    anyone    had to. And why not me  I'm a campaign organizer. I'm good at Facebook. And there's two of me. CO  The point is  if there's a flood or a fire or a hurricane  you  or somebody like you  are going to step up and start organizing things. The other point is that it is hard. MO  Lying on the ground after another    hour day  Caitria and I would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context    all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone. After another day and a shower at the shelter  we realized it shouldn't be this hard. CO  In a country like ours where we breathe Wi Fi  leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no brainer. Systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time. And if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster  these tools should exist. MO  So  we decided to build them  a recovery in a box  something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer. CO  I decided to stay in the country  give up the master's in Moscow and to work full time to make this happen. In the course of the past year  we've become experts in the field of community powered disaster recovery. And there are three main problems that we've observed with the way things work currently. MO  The tools. Large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster  but they often fulfill very specific missions  and then they leave. This leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers  thousands of donations  and all with no training and no tools. So they use Post its or Excel or Facebook. But none of these tools allow you to value high priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes. CO  The timing. Disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign. In a political campaign  you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action. You build both gradually  until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election. In a disaster  however  you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity. And you've only got about seven days to capture    percent of all of the Web searches that will ever be made to help your area. Then some sporting event happens  and you've got only the resources that you've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs. This is the slide for Katrina. This is the curve for Joplin. And this is the curve for the Dallas tornadoes in April  where we deployed software. There's a gap here. Affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties. And you've only got about four days of interest in Dallas. MO  Data. Data is inherently unsexy  but it can jump start an area's recovery. FEMA and the state will pay    percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster  leaving the town to pay the last    percent of the bill. Now that expense can be huge  but if the town can mobilize X amount of volunteers for Y hours  the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town's contribution. But who knows that  Now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you've just sent out       volunteers and you can't prove it. CO  These are three problems with a common solution. If we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together  we can create new standards in disaster recovery. MO  We needed canvasing tools  donations databasing  needs reporting  remote volunteer access  all in an easy to use website. CO  And we needed help. Alvin  our software engineer and co founder  has built these tools. Chris and Bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships. And we've been flying into disaster areas since this past January  setting up software  training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters. MO  One of our first launches was after the Dallas tornadoes this past April. We flew into a town that had a static  outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed  trying to structure the response  and we launched our platform. All of the interest came in the first four days  but by the time they lost the news cycle  that's when the needs came in  yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they've been able to meet the needs of their residents. CO  So it's working  but it could be better. Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient. Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster. So that's what we're working on. We're working on getting the software to places so people expect it  so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that micro information that drives recovery. MO  It's not rocket science. These tools are obvious and people want them. In our hometown  we trained a half dozen residents to run these Web tools on their own  because Caitria and I live here  in Boston. They took to it immediately  and now they are forces of nature. There are over three volunteer groups working almost every day  and have been since June   of last year  to make sure these residents get what they need and get back in their homes. They have hotlines and spreadsheets and data. CO  And that makes a difference. June   this year marked the one year anniversary of the Monson tornado  and our community's never been more connected or more empowered. We've been able to see the same transformation in Texas and in Alabama. Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT to fly in and fix problems after a disaster  it takes a local. No matter how good an aid organization is at what they do  they eventually have to go home. But if you give locals the tools  if you show them what they can do to recover  they become experts. MO  All right. Let's go. The story starts  I was at a friend's house  and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual  which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be  back in the '  s  a very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger  and now it's     pages long. And it lists currently     mental disorders. So I was leafing through it  wondering if I had any mental disorders  and it turns out I've got   . I've got generalized anxiety disorder  which is a given. I've got nightmare disorder  which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure  and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going   You're a failure   I've got parent child relational problems  which I blame my parents for. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. And I've got malingering. And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder  because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious. Anyway  I was looking through this book  wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was  or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional  or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder. I didn't know which of these was true  but I thought it was kind of interesting  and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view  which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists. It was a man called Brian  who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies. They're called the CCHR. And I said to him   Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo science that can't be trusted   And he said   Yes  we can prove it to you.  And I said   How   And he said   We're going to introduce you to Tony.  And I said   Who's Tony   And he said   Tony's in Broadmoor.  Now  Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. It's where they send the serial killers  and the people who can't help themselves. And I said to Brian   Well  what did Tony do   And he said   Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something  and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well  and now he's stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he's sane. Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony   So I said   Yes  please.  So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park  which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious  they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center  which is where you get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It's all peach and pine and calming colors. And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants  and quite docile looking. And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me   They're medicated   which  to the Scientologists  is like the worst evil in the world  but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea. And then Brian said   Here's Tony.  And a man was walking in. And he wasn't overweight  he was in very good physical shape. And he wasn't wearing sweatpants  he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said   So is it true that you faked your way in here   And he said   Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was   . And I was in prison awaiting trial  and my cellmate said to me  'You know what you have to do  Fake madness. Tell them you're mad  you'll get sent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas  you'll have your own PlayStation.'  I said   Well  how did you do it   He said   Well  I asked to see the prison psychiatrist. And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist  'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'  And I said   What else   He said   Oh  yeah. I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died  because it would make me feel more normal.  I said   Where'd you get that from   He said   Oh  from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library.  Anyway  he faked madness too well  he said. And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there  said he took one look at the place  asked to see the psychiatrist  said   There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I'm not mentally ill.  I said   How long have you been here for   He said   Well  if I'd just done my time in prison for the original crime  I'd have got five years. I've been in Broadmoor for    years.  Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane than it is to convince them you're crazy. He said   I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what's on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist  and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse  'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ' When I read my medical notes  I saw they'd written  'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'  He said   You know  they're always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way  How do you cross your legs in a sane way  It's just impossible.  When Tony said that to me  I thought to myself   Am I sitting like a journalist  Am I crossing my legs like a journalist   He said   You know  I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me  and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose.  So  only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway  he seemed completely normal to me  but what did I know  And when I got home I emailed his clinician  Anthony Maden. I said   What's the story   And he said   Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence  because his hallucinations    that had seemed quite cliche to begin with    just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor. However  we have assessed him  and we've determined that what he is is a psychopath.  And in fact  faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath. It's on the checklist  cunning  manipulative. So  faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts  and they said the pinstripe suit    classic psychopath    speaks to items one and two on the checklist  glibness  superficial charm and grandiose sense of self worth. And I said   Well  but why didn't he hang out with the other patients   Classic psychopath    it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence  according to his clinician  that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me   If you want to know more about psychopaths  you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by Robert Hare  who invented the psychopath checklist.  So I did. I went on a psychopath spotting course  and I am now a certified    and I have to say  extremely adept    psychopath spotter. So  here's the statistics  One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath. So there's       people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders  so I think there's a very good chance there's about    or    psychopaths in this room. It could be carnage by the end of the night. Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior    the lack of empathy  the glibness  cunning  manipulative. In fact  capitalism  perhaps at its most remorseless  is a physical manifestation of psychopathy. It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all. Hare said   You know what  Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares  That's not a big story. The big story   he said   is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths.  So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people. I said   Could I come and interview you in prison  to find out it you're psychopaths   And they didn't reply. So I changed tack. I emailed  Chainsaw Al  Dunlap  the asset stripper from the     s. He would come into failing businesses and close down    percent of the workforce  just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said   I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special  and interested in the predatory spirit  and fearless. Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly   And he said   Come on over   So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals. There were lions and tigers    he was taking me through the garden    there were falcons and eagles  he was saying   Over there you've got sharks and     he was saying this in a less effeminate way     You've got more sharks and you've got tigers.  It was like Narnia. And then we went into his kitchen. Now  Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies  he'd close down    percent of the workforce. And he'd quite often fire people with a joke. Like  for instance  one famous story about him  somebody came up to him and said   I've just bought myself a new car.  And he said   Well  you may have a new car  but I'll tell you what you don't have    a job.  So in his kitchen    he was in there with his wife  Judy  and his bodyguard  Sean    and I said   You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special   He said   Yeah  it's an amazing theory  it's like Star Trek. You're going where no man has gone before.  And I said   Well      Clears throat  Some psychologists might say that this makes you      Mumbles  And he said   What   And I said   A psychopath.  And I said   I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you   And he looked intrigued despite himself  and he said   Okay  go on.  And I said   Okay. Grandiose sense of self worth.  Which I have to say  would have been hard for him to deny  because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself. He said   Well  you've got to believe in you   And I said   Manipulative.  He said   That's leadership.  And I said   Shallow affect  an inability to experience a range of emotions.  He said   Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions   So he was going down the psychopath checklist  basically turning it into  Who Moved My Cheese   But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal    like he said  no  to juvenile delinquency  he said he got accepted into West Point  and they don't let delinquents in West Point. He said  no  to many short term marital relationships. He's only ever been married twice. Admittedly  his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like  but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument  and his second marriage has lasted    years. So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic  I thought to myself  well I'm not going to put that in my book. And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked  Psychopath.  I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges. And I realized  my God    this is what I've been doing for    years. It's what all journalists do. We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands  and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee's personality. And we stitch them together like medieval monks  and we leave the normal stuff on the floor. And you know  this is a country that over diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar    children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums  which scores them high on the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London  Tony phoned me. He said   Why haven't you been returning my calls   I said   Well  they say that you're a psychopath.  And he said   I'm not a psychopath.  He said   You know what  One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse  but another item on the checklist is cunning  manipulative. So when you say you feel remorse for your crime  they say  'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.' It's like witchcraft  they turn everything upside down.  He said   I've got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it   So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after    years in Broadmoor  they let him go. They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me   You know what  Jon  Everyone's a bit psychopathic.  He said   You are  I am. Well  obviously I am.  I said   What are you going to do now   He said   I'm going to go to Belgium. There's a woman there that I fancy. But she's married  so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband.  Anyway  that was two years ago  and that's where my book ended. And for the last    months  everything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was  according to Brian the Scientologist  making up for lost time  which I know sounds ominous  but isn't necessarily ominous. Unfortunately  after    months  he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a  fracas  in a bar  he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month  which I know is bad  but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was  it wasn't too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what  I think it's right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges. And what Tony is  is he's a semi psychopath. He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas. But the gray areas are where you find the complexity. It's where you find the humanity  and it's where you find the truth. And Tony said to me   Jon  could I buy you a drink in a bar  I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me.  And I didn't go. What would you have done  Thank you. I've got a great idea that's going to change the world. It's fantastic  it's going to blow your mind. It's my beautiful baby. Here's the thing  everybody loves a beautiful baby. I mean  I was a beautiful baby. Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born. So in the world of product design  the beautiful baby's like the concept car. It's the knockout. You see it and you go   Oh  my God. I'd buy that in a second   So why is it that this year's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year's new cars  What went wrong between the design studio and the factory  Today  I don't want to talk about beautiful babies  I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design    those sort of dorky teenage years where you're trying to figure out how the world works. I'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health. So here's a problem  four million babies around the world  mostly in developing countries  die every year before their first birthday  even before their first month of life. It turns out half of those kids  or about  .  million newborns around the world  would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days  maybe the first week. So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu  Nepal. All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators    something like this. This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu. This is what we want. Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal. The problem is  without technicians  without spare parts  donations like this very quickly turn into junk. So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about. Keeping a baby warm for a week    that's not rocket science. So we got started. We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston. We conducted months of user research overseas  trying to think like designers  human centered design     Let's figure out what people want.  We killed thousands of Post it notes. We made dozens of prototypes to get to this. So this is the NeoNurture infant incubator  and this has a lot of smarts built into it  and we felt great. So the idea here is  unlike the concept car  we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works. And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it. Here's the bad news  the only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot. So recognition is fantastic. We want design to get out for people to see it. It won lots of awards. But it felt like a booby prize. We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place  and I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm. So it turns out that design  for inspiration doesn't really ... I guess what I would say is  for us  for what I want to do  it's either too slow or it just doesn't work  it's ineffective. So  really  I want to design for outcomes. I don't want to make beautiful stuff  I want to make the world a better place. So when we were designing NeoNurture  we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing  for example  poor families  rural doctors  overloaded nurses  even repair technicians. We thought we had all our bases covered  we'd done everything right. Well  it turns out there's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful  manufacturing  financing  distribution  regulation. Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will  choose  use and pay the dues  for a product like this. And I have to ask the question that VCs always ask   Sir  what is your business  and who is your customer   Who is our customer  Well  here's an example. This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility. It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment. Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors  and it just kind of shows up. Similarly  here's a multinational medical device manufacturer. It turns out they've got to fish where the fish are. So it turns out that in emerging markets    where the fish are    are the emerging middle class of these countries    diseases of affluence  heart disease  infertility. So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution. OK  that was an important lesson. Second  we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project. So we started by finding a manufacturer  an organization called MTTS in Vietnam  that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia. Our other partner is East Meets West  an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region. So we started with them  saying   Well  what do you want  What's a problem you want to solve   And they said   Let's work on newborn jaundice.  So this is another one of these mind boggling global problems. Jaundice affects two thirds of newborns around the world. Of those newborns  one in    roughly  if it's not treated  the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life long disability  or the kids could even die. There's one way to treat jaundice  and that's what's called an exchange transfusion. So as you can imagine  that's expensive and a little bit dangerous. There is another cure. It's very technological  it's very complex  a little daunting. You've got to shine blue light on the kid. Bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover. How is this a hard problem  I went to MIT. OK  we'll figure that out. So here's an example. This is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals  and here's how it's supposed to be used. It's over the baby  illuminating a single patient. Take it out of an American hospital  send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia  here's how it's actually used. The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity. These dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy. Here's what it looks like under actual use. So those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy. But without training  without some kind of light meter  how would you know  We see other examples of problems like this. Here's a neonatal intensive care unit  where moms come in to visit their babies. And keep in mind that Mom maybe just had a C section  so that's already kind of a bummer. Mom's visiting her kid. She sees her baby naked  lying under some blue lights  looking kind of vulnerable. It's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby. From a phototherapy standpoint  maybe not the best behavior. In fact  that sounds kind of dumb. Except  what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user    there are only dumb products. We have to think like existentialists  it's not the painting we would have painted  it's the painting that we actually painted. It's the use    designed for actual use. How are people actually going to use this  So  similarly  when we think about our partner MTTS  they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses. So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP. They're inexpensive  really rugged. They've treated        kids in Vietnam with this technology. But here's the problem  Every doctor in the world  every hospital administrator  has seen TV    curse those  ER  reruns  Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like. They want Buck Rogers  they don't want effective. It sounds crazy  it sounds dumb  but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy. So again  if we want people to trust a device  it has to look trustworthy. So thinking about outcomes  it turns out appearances matter. We took all that information together. We tried  this time  to get it right. And here's what we developed. This is the Firefly phototherapy device  except this time  we didn't stop at the concept car. From the very beginning  we started by talking to manufacturers. Our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture. Our goal is to study how they work  the resources they have access to  so that they can make this product. So that's the design for manufacture question. When we think about actual use  you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet. It only fits a single baby  and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device. If you try to put more than one kid in  you're stacking them on top of each other. So the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong. In other words  you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it. Another example    again  silly Mom. Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold  wants to put a blanket over the baby. That's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly  so if Mom does put a blanket over the baby  it's still receiving effective phototherapy from below. Last story here  I've got a friend in India who told me that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia  until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside. You think it's funny. I had a laptop in the Peace Corps  and the screen had all these dead pixels on it. And one day I looked in    they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished. Those poor ants. So with Firefly  what we did is    the problem is electronics get hot  and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool    in most products. We decided we can't put a  Do not enter  sign next to the vent. We actually got rid of all that stuff. So Firefly's totally sealed. These are the kinds of lessons    as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager  much worse to be a frustrated designer. So I was thinking   What I really want to do is change the world. I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution. I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device. I actually have to pay attention. There's no excuse for failure. I have to think like an existentialist. I have to accept that there are no dumb users  only dumb products.  We have to ask ourselves hard questions. Are we designing for the world that we want  Are we designing for the world that we have  Are we designing for the world that's coming  whether we're ready or not  I got into this business designing products. I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world  you have to design outcomes. And that's design that matters. Thank you. I worked on a film called  Apollo      and when I worked on this film  I discovered something about how our brains work  and how our brains work is that  when we're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever  it changes and alters our perception of things. It changes what we see. It changes what we remember. And as an experiment  because I dauntingly create a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch for this particular movie  because I put it out there  I felt a little nervous about it  so I need to do an experiment and bring a group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage  and when I played this stock footage  I simply wanted to find out what people remembered  what was memorable about it  What should I actually try to replicate  What should I try to emulate to some degree  So this is the footage that I was showing everybody. And what I discovered is  because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film  there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things. When I showed it  and I asked  immediately after the screening was over  what they thought of it  what was your memorable shots  they changed them. They were    had camera moves on them. They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined  and I was just really curious  I mean  what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come  how'd you come up with this sort of description  And what I discovered is  what I should do is not actually replicate what they saw  is replicate what they remembered. So this is our footage of the launch  based on  basically  taking notes  asking people what they thought  and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like  but not what it really looked like. So this is what we created for  Apollo   .  So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people  a bunch of different memories  including my own  of taking a little bit of liberty with the subject matter. I basically shot everything with short lenses  which means that you're very close to the action  but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance  so I was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven't really quite seen before.  Music  And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it. Tom Hanks  Hello  Houston  this is Odyssey. It's good to see you again.  Cheers   Music  Rob Legato  I pretend they're clapping for me. So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can  and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers  fire  I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice  and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you  what you were reacting to  what you're emoting to  is something that's a total falsehood  and I found that really kind of fascinating. And in this particular case  this is the climax of the movie  and  you know  the weight of achieving it was simply take a model  throw it out of a helicopter  and shoot it. And that's simply what I did. That's me shooting  and I'm a fairly mediocre operator  so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude  of a kind of  you know  following the rocket all the way down  and giving that little sort of edge  I was desperately trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing. We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut  who was actually on some of the missions  of Apollo     and he was there to basically double check my science. And  I guess somebody thought they needed to do that. I don't know why  but they thought they did. So we were  he's a hero  he's an astronaut  and we're all sort of excited  and  you know  I gave myself the liberty of saying  you know  some of the shots I did didn't really suck that bad. And so maybe  you know  we were feeling kind of a little good about it  so I brought him in here  and he needed to really check and see what we were doing  and basically give us our A plus report card  and so I showed him some shots we were working on  and waiting for the reaction that you hope for  which is what I got.  Music   Launch noises  So I showed him these two shots  and then he basically told me what he thought. Okay.  Laughter  It's what you dream about. So what I got from him is  he turned to me and said   You would never  ever design a rocket like that. You would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that  You would never  ever design a rocket like that.  And he was looking at me. It's like  Yeah  I don't know if you noticed  but I'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of America's finest moments with fire extinguishers. And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut  a hero  and I'm from New Jersey  so    I'm just going to show you some footage. I'm just going to show you some footage  and tell me what you think. And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for. So I showed him this  and this is actual footage that he was on. This is Apollo   . This was his mission. So I showed him this  and the reaction I got was interesting. So  and what happened was  I mean  what I sort of intuned in that is that he remembered it differently. He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system  perfectly safe rocket launch  because he's sitting in a rocket that has  like  a hundred thousand pounds of thrust  built by the lowest bidder. He was hoping it was going to work out okay. So he twisted his memory around. Now  Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin  who was not on the movie  so he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage  and he just responded as he would respond  and I'll run this. Ron Howard  Buzz Aldrin came up to me and said   Hey  that launch footage  I saw some shots I'd never seen before. Did you guys  what vault did you find that stuff in   And I said   Well  no vault  Buzz  we generated all that from scratch.  And he said   Huh  that's pretty good. Can we use it   RL  I think he's a great American. So   Titanic  was  if you don't know the story  doesn't end well. Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic. So he basically set up  or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief  because what he photographed was the real thing  a Mir sub going down  or actually two Mir subs going down to the real wreck  and he created this very haunting footage. It's really beautiful  and it conjures up all these various different emotions  but he couldn't photograph everything  and to tell the story  I had to fill in the gaps  which is now rather daunting  because now I have to recreate back to back what really happened and I had  I'm the only one who could really blow it at that point. So this is the footage he photographed  and it was pretty moving and pretty awe inspiring. So I'm going to just let it run  so you kind of absorb this sort of thing  and I'll describe my sort of reactions when I was looking at it for the very first time. I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life. I automatically wanted to see this ship  this magnificent ship  basically in all its glory  and conversely  I wanted to see it not in all its glory  basically go back to what it looks like. So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you what I tried to do  which is kind of the heart of the movie  for me  and so that's why I wanted to do the movie  that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created. And I'll show you  you know  another thing that I found interesting is what we really were emoting to when you take a look at it. So here's the behind the scenes  a couple of little shots here. So  when you saw my footage  you were seeing this  basically  a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down  and the little Mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs  and shot in smoke. Jim went three miles went down  and I went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage. And so  but what you're emoting to  or what you're looking at  had the same feeling  the same haunting quality  that Jim's footage had  so I found it so fascinating that our brains sort of  once you believe something's real  you transfer everything that you feel about it  this quality you have  and it's totally artificial. It's totally make believe  yet it's not to you  and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use  and it caused me to create the next effect that I'll show you  which is this sort of magic transition  and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect  so it became a seamless experience for them  that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation  I was showing you what you wanted to see. And the very next shot  right after this    So you can see what I was doing. So basically  if there's two subs in the same shot  I shot it  because where's the camera coming from  And when Jim shot it  it was only one sub  because he was photographing from the other  and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this. I'll give it to Jim  because he could use the pat on the back. Okay. So now the Titanic transition. So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the Titanic to the other. So I'll just play the shot once.  Music  And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you. Gloria Stuart  That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. RL  So  what I did is basically I had another screening room experience where I was basically tracking where I was looking  or where we were looking  and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow of the ship  and then at some point  I'm changing the periphery of the shot  I'm changing  it's becoming the rusted wreck  and then I would run it every day  and then I would find exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it  and the moment my eye shifted  we just marked it to the frame. The moment my eye shifted  I immediately started to change them  so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped. And so I'll just show it one more time. naturally do for us  which is  as soon as you shift your attention  something changes  and then I left the little scarf going  because it really wanted to be a ghostly shot  really wanted to feel like they were still on the wreck  essentially. That's where they were buried forever. Or something like that. I just made that up. It was  incidentally  the last time I ever saw daylight. It was a long film to work on.  Laughter  Now   Hugo  was another interesting movie  because the movie itself is about film illusions. It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture  and one of the things I had to do is  we   Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever  very smart guy  comedian  wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things  and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train. Very dangerous  very impossible to do  and particularly on our stage  because there literally is no way to actually move this train  because it fits so snugly into our set. So let me show you the scene  and then I basically used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein  which is  if you have a camera that's moving with a moving object  what is not moving appears to be moving  and what is moving appears to be stopped  so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all  and what is actually moving is the floor. So this is the shot. That's a little video of what you're looking at there  which is our little test  so that's actually what you're seeing  and I thought it was sort of an interesting thing  because it was  part of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for. I'd love to but I can't  because it was invented like in      or something like that  is I told Marty  and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's really hard to really get until you actually see it work  and I said  you know  what I was going to do  and he said   So  let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels  That doesn't move.   And the thing without the wheels  that moves.  Precisely.  Laughter  Brings me to the next  and final    Marty's not going to see this  is he   Laughter  This isn't viewed outside of     Laughter  The next illustration is something that  there's like all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story  especially if you're following somebody on a journey  and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise way  and what we wanted to do based on the shot in  Goodfellas   which is one of the great shots ever  a Martin Scorsese film  of basically following Henry Hill through what it feels like to be a gangster walk going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way. He was the master of his universe  and we wanted Hugo to feel the same way  so we created this shot. That's Hugo.  Music  And we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him  we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe  and his universe is  you know  behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way  and we had to make it feel that this is his normal  everyday sort of life  so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important  and of course  in shooting in  D  which is basically it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick  so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task  and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the  Goodfellas  shot. So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it. It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys. The one on the left is where the shot ends  and the shot on the right is where it takes over  and now we switch boys  so it went from Asa Butterfield  who's the star of the show  to his stand in.  Music  I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig that we built for this.  Music  And so this is  and now this is set number three we're into  and then we're going to go into  basically the very last moment of the shot is actually the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes and various things like that  and it literally was done over five different sets  two different boys  different times  and it all had to feel like it was all one shot  and what was sort of great for me was it was probably the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on  and  you know  I was kind of proud of it when I was done  which is  you should never really be proud of stuff  I guess. So I was kind of proud of it  and I went to a friend of mine  and said   You know  this is  you know  kind of the best reviewed shot I've ever worked on. What do you think was the reason   And he said   Because no one knows you had anything to do with it.  So  all I can say is  thank you  and that's my presentation for you.  Applause
