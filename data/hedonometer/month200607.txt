I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish  I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been  and that's around the world. When I was about    years old  Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work  not only about responding to natural disasters  but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce  innovative  sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect  or training as an architect  and I was always interested in socially responsible design  and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school  it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design  you design a jewel  and it's a jewel that you try and crave for  whereas I felt that when you design  you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole. And in       we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing    like I said  mid   s    and I'm the Internet generation  so we started a website. We put a call out there  and to my surprise  in a couple of months  we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa  responding to the HIV AIDS pandemic. That led to     entries from    countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.      was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran  in Bam  also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States    most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman  Montana    go up to the north plains on the reservations  or go down to Alabama or Mississippi  pre Katrina  and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere  and also  I will go into some more projects.       Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that      was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet  and because of connections to blogs and so forth  within literally hours of the tsunami  we were already raising funds  getting involved  working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops  and in the first couple of days  I had       emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there  and I'll talk about some others. And then of course  this year we've been responding to Katrina  as well as following up on our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In       I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help  or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open source model of business    so that anyone  anywhere in the world  could start a local chapter  and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means  you know  somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is  we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools  and we ended up having    chapters starting up  thousands of architects in     countries. So the bullet point    sorry  I never do a suit  so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK  because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on  of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller  and that we have the opportunity    not the responsibility  but the opportunity    to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is  we've got these thousands of designers working around the world  connected basically by a website  and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it  we did it. And so there's something to be said about na vet . So seven years later  we've developed so that we've got advocacy  instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design  not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums  op eds  we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA  but that's another talk. Instigation  developing ideas with communities and NGOs  doing open source design competitions. Referring  matchmaking with communities. And then implementing    actually going out there and doing the work  because when you invent  it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change  we build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '  . We did an open design competition  like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter  but transitional shelter that would last five to    years  that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in  and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous  but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built  it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building  but also the issues of governance  and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers  but also a whole variety of technology based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction  creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '  . We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days  we realized the problem was not housing  it was the growing pandemic of HIV AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this  it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk        kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community  and you know  we thought we were real bright sparks     We've come up with this great idea  mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub Saharan Africa.  And the medical community there said   We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.  So in a way  we had taken pre existing needs and shown solutions. And so again  we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. This one I personally love  because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions  but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land  and it grows    feet in a month. And on the fourth week  the doctors come and they mow out an area  put a tensile structure on the top  and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat your own clinic. So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS  you also need to have nutrition rates  and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know  this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic  it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community  so it can be a self sustaining project. Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day  you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from  you have to know where your resource is coming from  and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night  it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes  and they were eventually built. And currently  as of this year  there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. From that  we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said   The problem is that the girls don't have education.  And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of    and    have a    percent HIV AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous  it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look at the idea of sports  and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV AIDS outreach center  and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region  and then the community picked their design. They said  this is our design  because it's not only about engaging a community  it's about empowering a community  and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. So  the winning design is here. And then  of course  we actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu Natal  Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. Video  Well  my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre  I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa  Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League  for the team called Tembisa  which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair  I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection  just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center  in Tanzania. And we met  literally  a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there  working in partnership. This was a matchmaking  thanks to a couple of TEDsters    Sun  Microsystems   Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli  who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June  and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal  you can check it out. But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we've been involved in a lot of issues  such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a     dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community  and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually  the community  through skills training  end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months       plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement  that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down  you can't hear a thing  and in the summer  it's about     degrees inside. So we said  if the rain's coming down  let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost  three classrooms and rainwater collection is       dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on site  building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago  and there's     kids that are now using the schools. So  disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that  but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together  and they said  no  to waiting. They formed a partnership  a diverse partnership of players  to actually map out East Biloxi  to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over       volunteers rebuilding  rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are  not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents  getting them out of their homes  so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home  done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's    years old. This is what FEMA gave her.     bucks  happened two days ago. We put together  very quickly  a washroom. It's built  it's running and she just started a business today  where she's washing other people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last    years. That was their home  and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping  working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of  support. Why don't aid agencies do this  This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent  just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap    that's the invention. It took    years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was    years old. There's a problem here. Luckily  we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses    it's a theme in Japan  apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. This is a Grip Clip  designed by somebody who said   All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.  This guy designed for NASA  is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly  because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took    years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India  Mexico  Alabama  China  Israel  Palestine  Vietnam. The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is       that's how old I am. So it's a young    I just have to stop here  because Arup is in the room  and this is the best designed toilet in the world. If you're ever  ever in India  go use this toilet. Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York  but this. And when you look at this  you see crisis. What I see is many  many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen  in    years  one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left  look right  one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people  With    million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. Chris Anderson  Wait a sec    that's your wish  CS  That's my wish. CA  That's his wish  CS  We started Architecture for Humanity with     dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me        . So why not this many people  Open source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants    and we're not just talking about inventors and designers  but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer  it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally  because I haven't slept in seven years. Secondly  what will this thing be  Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis  but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can    The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built  anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this  but still protect their rights here  We want to have a community where you can upload ideas  and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake  in flood  in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late  we need to do it now. So doing that globally    and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually. When you look at the face of an architect  most people think a gray haired white guy. I don't see that  I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs based competitions    XPRIZE for the other    percent  if you want to call it that. We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together  and the idea of integrating manufacturers    fab labs in every country. When I hear about the      laptop and it's going to educate every child    educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela  every slum settlement. Because you know what  Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging  and the one thing we've been talking about is  I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas  adapt them  and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable  they should have the potential for evolution  they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take  There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this  because I'm going to be yanked off. CA  Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS  Well  what will it take  You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power  because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs  but utilize the designs. Also  a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing  because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so  you know  I want these    I just should note  I have two laptops and one of them is there  and that has      designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens  So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use  easy to get ahold of. My mom once said   There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.  I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines  we've changed public policy  we've changed international response    based on building things. So for me  it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation  and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture    this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe    years too early. So let's do it. Thank you. I can't help but this wish  to think about when you're a little kid  and all your friends ask you   If a genie could give you one wish in the world  what would it be   And I always answered   Well  I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.  Well  then you'd be screwed  because you'd know what to wish for  and you'd use up your wish  and now  since we only have one wish    unlike last year they had three wishes    I'm not going to wish for that. So let's get to what I would like  which is world peace. And I know what you're thinking  You're thinking   The poor girl up there  she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.  But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different people over the years  and I've filmed some of them  from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world  to a military press officer in Qatar  who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film  Control Room  that was sent out  you'd understand a little bit why. Thank you. Wow  Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great. So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel  to meet people in a different way than    because you can't travel all over the world at the same time. And a long time ago    well  about    years ago    my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world is getting smaller  it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves  that we meet each other  we get to know each other  we are able to figure out a way to cross borders  to understand each other  to understand people's hopes and dreams  what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't all do exchange programs  and I can't force everybody to travel  I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy  and they said that there's a problem with this  You can't force people  free will. And I totally support that  so we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane  and just requires a movie camera  a projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today. I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from  and Cameron  I don't know how you managed to get out of that one  but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian father. So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together. No pun intended. And I've also been called  as an Egyptian Lebanese Syrian American with a Persian name  the  Middle East Peace Crisis.  So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together    a way to take the worlds with me  a way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way  but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage collecting village in Egypt  when I was about   . My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly in community service  and decided that this was something that I needed to do. And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. There was a center there  where they were teaching people how to read and write  and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English  and I met some incredible women there. I met people that live seven people to a room  barely can afford their evening meal  yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities. I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings and older family members    things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started taking these pictures  the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was     I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there  and after about two days  they all came down except for three. People were very upset  very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo  and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame  And as I sat there  I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were  you know  very pretty photographs and I was like   I failed at this.  But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs. Here I was  this    year old pipsqueak that nobody listened to  and all of a sudden  I put these photographs on the wall  and there were arguments  and they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image  and it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves  that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps  to bridge cultures  bring people together  cross borders. And so that's what really kind of started me off. Did a stint at MTV  made a film called  Startup.com   and I've done a couple of music films. But in       when the war in Iraq was about to start  it was a very surreal feeling for me  because before the war started  there was kind of this media war that was going on. And I was watching television in New York  and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across  and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings  and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators  and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East  where my parents were. I knew that there was a completely other story being told  and I was thinking   How are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages  and nobody knows what the other's being told  How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future  So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time    I had somebody bring it there  because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera  George Bush's favorite channel  and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world  and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government. So I was thinking  this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see Central Command  which was    minutes away. And that way  I could get access to how this news was being created    on the Arab side  reaching the Arab world  and on the US and Western side  reaching the US. And when I went there and sat there  and met these people that were in the center of it  and sat with these characters  I met some surprising  very complex people. And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them  and you listen to them  and you allow them more than a five second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges. Samir Khader  Business as usual. Iraq  and then Iraq  and then Iraq. But between us  if I'm offered a job with Fox  I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it  but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school  I will send them to America to study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing  The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers    Al Jazeera showed them    it was powerful  because America doesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform  strewn about a floor  a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was  the night before  there had been some kind of bombing in Basra  and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people. And they were equally  if not more  horrifying    the images were. And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office  and thought to myself   Wow  that's gross. That's bad.  And then going away  and probably eating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So  the impact that had on me    me realizing that I just saw people on the other side  and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night  and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet. Jehane Noujaim  I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world  we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film. In the Arab world    and it's not really by the film  it's by the characters    I mean  Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film in the Middle East  people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us as an American population. People started to ask me   Where is this guy now   Al Jazeera offered him a job. And Samir  on the other hand  was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see  because it brought out the complexities of this love hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West. In the United States  I was blown away by the motivations  the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film. You know  we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way  but the flip side of it is that  actually  when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad  we feel this power  that we need to    we feel like we have to get the power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me after the screening and said   You know  I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes  I saw the military going out to war  but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war  and how do we get out of this bubble  How do we understand what the other person is thinking   Now  I don't know whether a film can change the world. But I know the power of it  I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world. Now  I'm not a philosopher  so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this  but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders  I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today.  The last    hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.   Paradise Now   Man  As long as there is injustice  someone must make a sacrifice    Woman  That's no sacrifice  that's revenge    If you kill  there's no difference between victim and occupier.   Man  If we had airplanes  we wouldn't need martyrs  that's the difference.   Woman  The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.   Man  Then let us be equal in death.   We still have Paradise.   Woman  There is no Paradise  It only exists in your head    Man  God forbid    May God forgive you.   If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...   Anyway  I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell    In this life  we're dead anyway.   One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.

We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot  who lost children    and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.

Death unto apartheid   Narrator  It's about the liberation struggle. It's about those children who took to the streets    fighting  screaming   Free Nelson Mandela   It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes  Jehane Noujaim  I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater  in a dark room  with other strangers  watching a very powerful film  and they felt that feeling of transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film  I've been listening to the talks in the conference  and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity  then they will have an appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film  getting these independent voices out there. Now  Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices  to give power to the filmmakers  to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness  that you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision  that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace  and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool  to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack  and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films and there's Current TV  which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their    Yeah  it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world    independent voices from around the world    and create a truly democratic  global television. So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations  to create some momentum  to get everybody in the world involved in this movement  I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world. You have towns and villages and theaters    all from around the world  getting together  and sitting in the dark  and sharing a communal experience of watching a film  or a couple of films  together. Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live  or just a character that defies stereotypes  makes a joke  sings a song. Comedies  documentaries  shorts. This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together  to cross borders  and have people feel like they're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day when all around the world  you have theaters and places where we project films. If you imagine projecting from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo  the same film in Ramallah  the same film in Jerusalem. You know  we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine  in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience. And I believe that this one day  if we can create it  this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there  and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other  and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that  and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together    this could be an incredible day. So we've already made a partnership  set up through somebody from the TED community  John Camen  who introduced me to Steven Apkon  from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week  there have been so many people that have responded to us  from as close as Palo Alto  to Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film  to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now  we've thought about a name for this day  and I'd like to share this with you. Now  the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes  and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future  How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future  so that we can build community and have these communities working together  through the Internet  There was a time  many  many years ago  when all of the continents were stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching  then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better. I know that it's very intangible  touching people's hearts and souls  but the only way that I know how to do it  the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world  is by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you my one sentence wish  but we're way out of time. Chris Anderson  That is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema  The day the world comes together. JN  It's more tangible than world peace  and it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film  the power of film. CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Jehane Noujaim. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year  and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more    the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that    than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you    so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch  but you should look at them with optimism  because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist. But first  I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco  I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island  and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island  and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz  and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth  I caught the baby  I got off the island  I landed in San Francisco  and all the press wanted to talk to me  because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television  they called me up  and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said  yes  I would do that  so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called  Medicine Ball Caravan.  Now  you know from the '  s  you're either on the bus or you're off the bus  I was on the bus. My wife of    years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London  then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran  Afghanistan  over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan  like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass  and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then  like everyone else in our generation  we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. This is just like a residency program  for those of you that are in medical school. And we studied with a wise man  a guru named Karoli Baba  who then told me to get rid of the dress  put on a three piece suit  go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated  and that this was God's gift to humanity  because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu  and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed  certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history. The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection  early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that  early detection  early response. Can you say that  Audience  Early detection  early response. Larry Brilliant  Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century  it killed     million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin    with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation    in the year in which they were born  two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in     . This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health   Sovereigns killed by smallpox  because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest  and to be kings and queens of the world  did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together. But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother  watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one  day two  day three  day four  day five  day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child  and on day six  you see pustules that become hard. Day seven  they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight. And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world  the most printed image in the world  was that of the Earth. But this was in       and as of that moment  this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed  because we printed two billion copies of this photograph  and we took them hand to hand  door to door  to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house  because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google  we didn't have web crawlers  we didn't have computers. By day nine    you look at this picture and you're horrified  I look at this picture and I say   Thank God   because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox  and I know this child will live. And by day     the lesions are scabbing  his eyelids are swollen  but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day     while he will be scarred for life  he will live. There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox  in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox  which killed     percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox  the most cruel of all  which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had    women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman. In       the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year  there were    countries affected with smallpox. By       we were down to    countries.       we were down to five countries. But in that year  smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In       India had a population of     million. There are    linguistic states in India  which is like saying    different countries. There are    million people on the road at any time  in buses and trains  walking          villages      million households  and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house  because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity  Shitala Mata  the cooling mother  and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox. It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities  smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So  how we eradicated smallpox was    max vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India  but one year later there'd be    million new babies  which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time  and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone  my         best friends and I went door to door  with that same picture  to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls. And in the process  I learned something very important. Every time we did a house to house search  we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search  we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search  we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary  because what we needed was early detection  early response. So we searched and we searched  and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that  the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in       we declared the globe free of smallpox. It was the largest campaign in United Nations history  until the Iraq war.         people from all over the world    doctors of every race  religion  culture and nation  who fought side by side  brothers and sisters  with each other  not against each other  in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria  yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection  early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann  who's watching this on the webcast    David  keep on going. We're close  We're down to four countries. I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time. Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection  early response. Blindness  the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness  so you can mount the correct response. The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme  who  having climbed the highest mountain  tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease  wanted to do it again. And over the last    years  Seva's programs in    countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue  blindness  which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease. In       Steve Jobs gave me that computer  which is Apple number     and it's still in Kathmandu  and it's still working  and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health  and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done  and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case    that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma    we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there. In your TED packages there's a DVD   Infinite Vision   about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind  which started as a Seva project  is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year  that one hospital will give back sight to more than         people in Tamil Nadu  India. Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things    this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage  with just a little bit of human to human transmission  but no human to human to human sustained transmission. The moment WHO says we've moved to category four    this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with     people you didn't know  coughing and sneezing  when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you  for which you had no antivirals or vaccine  I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them    these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza    and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them  What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic  If it happens  how bad do you think it will be  Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that     percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic  a billion people would get sick. As many as     million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke  and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely     million people dying  because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits  that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse  because travel is getting so much better. Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume  for example  that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks  and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now  if we had an  undo  button  and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started    if we could find it early  and we had early detection and early response  and we could put each one of those viruses in jail    that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is. We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve  and everyone in medicine  I think  ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is  an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here  so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur  and that is called GPHIN  it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu    that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic to be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it  and because of that  we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John  who I hope is in the audience some place    over there    who's the founder of GPHIN. Hello  Ron  And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa  where GPHIN is located  because not only did GPHIN find SARS early  but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran  but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February       but last September. We need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox    early detection  early response. Blindness  polio    early detection  early response. Pandemic bird flu    early detection  early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread. So  my TED wish is for you to help build a global system    an early warning system    to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is  Early Detection   But it should really be called ...  Total Early Detection.   TED  What  What  But in all seriousness  because this idea is birthed in TED  I would like it to be a legacy of TED  and I'd like to call it the  International System for Total Early Disease Detection.   INSTEDD  And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu  we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio terror or bio error  or shift or drift  we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal  we find them  and we respond to them. Instead of famine  hidden until it is too late  we detect it  and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government  and hidden in the bowels of government  let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language. Let's make it transparent  non governmental  not owned by any single country or company  housed in a neutral country  with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from        to    million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to     or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages  using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within     meters of the rumor that you hear  if it is  in fact  valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end. And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world  finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them  and sending our response to them  so that next year  instead of us meeting here  lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world  we will have pulled together  used the unique skills and the magic of this community  and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics  other catastrophes  and change the world  beginning right now. Chris Anderson  An amazing presentation. First of all  just so everyone understands  you're saying that by creating web crawlers  looking on the Internet for patterns  they can detect something suspicious before WHO  before anyone else can see it  Give an example of how that could possibly be true. Larry Brilliant  You're not mad about the copyright violation  CA  No. I love it. LB  Well  as Ron St. John    I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN    In       there was an outbreak of bird flu    H N . It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately  by slaughtering  .  million chickens and birds  and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection  immediate response. Then a number of years went by  and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web    only crawling        different websites  mostly periodicals    and they read about and heard about a concern  of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu. They reported this to WHO. WHO took a little while taking action  because WHO will only receive a report from a government  because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that  we were able to stop SARS. Now  what's really important is that  before there was GPHIN      percent of all the world's reports of bad things    whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola        percent of all those reports came from nations. The moment these guys in Ottawa    on a budget of         dollars a year    got cracking     percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN     percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other     nations. Now  here's what's really interesting  after they'd been working for a couple years  what do you think happened to those nations  They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now  their reporting percentage is down to    percent  because other nations have started to report. So  can you find diseases early by crawling the web  Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now  Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well  they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French. So yes  I want to take GPHIN  I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody  so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna  Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity  and that it's accessible to everyone. I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level  and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call  sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here  that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second    the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams  but in fact  we no longer see within this process  the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges    and this is  in the length of this  very hard to support why  connect all these things    but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic  almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of  shotgun flexibility     turn your head this way  shoot  and you're bound to kill something. So  this is the promise of high modernism  within a single space  actually  any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing  operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so  with this sort of idea  what happens is  whatever actually is in the building on opening day  or whatever seems to be the most immediate need  starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it  of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility  something that we call  compartmentalized flexibility.  And the idea is that you  within that continuum  identify a series of points  and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off center a little bit  but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility  that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about    I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams  and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board  we settled on two core positions. This is the first one  and this is showing  over the last     years  the evolution of the book  and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book  and our position was  books are technology    that's something people forget    but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise    and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first    is that libraries  since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America  had a second responsibility  and that was for social roles. Ok  now  this I'll come back to later  but something    actually  the librarians at first said   No  this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media  and particularly the book.  So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of  any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library  we don't know the future of the book  and so  we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic  and worse    not only were they very generic    so  not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area    but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case  what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach  simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict    and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future  but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future    put those in boxes designed specifically for it  and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now  we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media  in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re digest it back to them  show it to them and say   You know what  We haven't touched it  but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two thirds of it is already dedicated    that's the white band below  the thing you said isn't important    is already dedicated to social functions.  So once we had presented that back to them  they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles    that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library  specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram  here  you'll see a series of five platforms    sort of combs  collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces  things like reading rooms  whose evolution in            years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it  and to their chagrin  we came back a week later  and we presented them this. And as you can see  it is literally the diagram on the right. We just sized    no  really  I mean that  literally. The things on the left hand side of the diagram  those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code  and so forth. So  you see the five platforms  those are the boxes. within each one  a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum  these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea  the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way    it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the  th through   th floors of the building  but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run  no matter how it grows or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. And so this was the final operation  which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter  and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty  again  for economics. One  it is the lateral stability for the entire building  it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure  but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then    I'll use the word impregnated    but it had a layer of metal that was called  stretched metal.  That metal acts as a microlouver  so from the exterior of the building  the sun sees it as totally opaque  but from the interior  it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness  I apologize. So  this is the building. And I think what's important is  when we first unveiled the building  the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended  believe it or not  by the librarians. They said   Look  we don't know what it is  but we know it's everything that we need it to be  based on the observations that we've done about the program.  This is going into one of the entries. So  it's an unusual building for a public library  obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle  but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything  including eat  yell  play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife  right there. She said yes. I'm running out of time  so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral  because I think it's  as I said  the most    this is the main reading room    the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet  Ok  so here  this is the book spiral. So  it's very indiscernible  but it's actually a continuous stair stepping. It allows you to  on one city block  go up one full floor  so that it's on a continuum. Ok  now I'm going to go back  and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very  very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us  because they came to us and they said   We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for    years  but because of that temporary space  we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York  Chicago and Seattle  with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.  And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett  they could blow out a wall  they could do  Cherry Orchard  and blow a hole through the floor  and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand new building that could be a pristine building  but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is  they were what we call a multi form theater  they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena  then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations  and for operational budget reasons  this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the United States  so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head  to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house  and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere  wherever you place it  the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles  and redefine fly tower  acoustic enclosure  light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium  thrust  and in fact  arena and traverse and flat floor  in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact  using operational budget  we can    sorry  capital cost    we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from  between a series of forms and a series of processions  because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession  shows the first act in thrust  the intermission in a Greek procession  second act in arena  and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure  so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened  so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance  or you can even just have an open air performance  or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations  but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in  so in fact  the Dallas Theater Company    their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh  and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them  in the off season  the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again  remove the light enclosure  keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said    unlike normal developers    they said   We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.  And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money  they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma  so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large  in order to support their aspirations of the art  but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate  interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub building. So this is Louisville's skyline  and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First  the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites  all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center  and respect it. We had to operate within the     year floodplain. Now  this area floods three to four times a year  and there's a levee behind our site  similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I    corridor  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add  that would link a series of cultural buildings  and a view corridor    because this is the historic district    that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. And now we're going to add  .  million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing  that  .  million square feet    these are the different programs    the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  place them on sites  and now we'd have a really terrible situation  a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements    the different commercial elements  hotel  luxury housing  offices and so forth    and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact    and you know this    this is called the Time Warner Building. So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block  flip some of the elements over  reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown  and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept  and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok  it seems a very formal  willful gesture  but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again  when we unveiled it  there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement  not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now  within that center zone  as I said  we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here  this is sort of an x ray    the towers are totally developer driven. They told us the dimensions  the sizes and so forth  and we focused on taking all the public components    the lobbies  the bars    everything that different commercial elements would have  and combined it in the center  in the sort of subway map  in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this  where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the   nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen  or to see the art  and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool  they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool  so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So  how to build this. It's very simple  it's a chair. So  we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores  we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum  we put all the mechanical equipment in it  and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars  for instance  the ones that they did for the A   . Finish the cores  finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about    seconds  so I want to start an animation  and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. Chris asked me to add    the theater is under construction  and this project will start construction in about a year  and finish in     .  identify public elements   insert public elements at grade   optimize tower dimensions   place towers on site   lift program   flip    optimize program adjacencies   connect to context   redirect  th street  On September     the morning of my seventh birthday  I came downstairs to the kitchen  where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something  and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway  and they said   Hey  happy birthday   And I said   I'm seven.  And my father smiled and said   Well  you know what that means  don't you   And I said   Yeah  that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents   And my dad said   Well  yes. But more importantly  being seven means that you've reached the age of reason  and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  Now  I had heard this phrase   age of reason   before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second grade class at school. But when she said it  the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession  and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway  I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase   age of reason.  So  I said   Yeah  yeah  age of reason. What does that mean again   And my dad said   Well  we believe  in the Catholic Church  that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong  but when you're seven  you're old enough to know better. So  you've grown up and reached the age of reason  and now God will start keeping notes on you  and begin your permanent record.  And I said   Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time  up till today  all that time I was so good  God didn't notice it   And my mom said   Well  I noticed it.  And I thought   How could I not have known this before  How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me  All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all  how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me   So I said   Well  Mom and Dad  what about Santa Claus  I mean  Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice  right   And my dad said   Yeah  but  honey  I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And my mother said   Oh  Bob  stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean  she's seven. Julie  there is no Santa Claus.  Now  this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus  how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve  like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning  our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning  but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean  my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style  and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's. Plus  why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's  There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence  our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit  and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment  this humiliation of rejection by Santa  who was jolly    but let's face it  he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief. I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa  but rather  I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me  but maybe I could help someone else  someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria  they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason  and not yet seven. The answer was clear  my brother Bill. He was six. Well  I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday  and he was all by himself  just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said   Bill  I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven  and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.  And Bill said   So   And I said   So  you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.  And he said   So   And I said   So  So everything   And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps  I turned around dramatically and said   Oh  by the way  Bill    there is no Santa Claus.  Now  I didn't know it at the time  but I really wasn't turning seven on September   th. For my   th birthday  I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends  but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said   I need to speak to you privately. September   th is not your birthday. It's October   th.  And I said   What   And she said ...  Listen. The cut off date to start kindergarten was September   th.   So I told them that your birthday was September   th  and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place  so I started to tell you your birthday was September   th. But  Julie  you were so ready to start school  honey. You were so ready.  I thought about it  and when I was four  I was already the oldest of four children  and my mother even had another child to come  so what I think she    understandably    really meant was that she was so ready  she was so ready. Then she said   Don't worry  Julie. Every year on October   th  when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it  I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.  Which was comforting  but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me  without me. What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day  and it was so totally me. And this meant that I was a Libra  So  I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair  sort of lounging by some water  but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically  and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls  and frankly  the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing. But I got the new Libra poster  and I started to read my new Libra horoscope  and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me. It wasn't until years later  looking back on this whole age of reason  change of birthday thing  that it dawned on me  I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh  life can be so cruel. One day  two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now  I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles  and my block is    well  it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people  if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally  I just ignore the doorbell  but on this day  I answered. And there stood two boys  each about     in white  starched short sleeved shirts  and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  and they said they had a message for me  from God. I said   A message for me  From God   And they said   Yes.  Now  I was raised in the Pacific Northwest  around a lot of Church of Latter day Saints people and  you know  I've worked with them and even dated them  but I never really knew the doctrine  or what they said to people when they were out on a mission  and I guess I was sort of curious  so I said   Well  please  come in.  And they looked really happy  because I don't think this happens to them all that often. And I sat them down  and I got them glasses of water    Ok  I got it  I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair  that's the thing. You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok. So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water  and after niceties  they said   Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart   And I thought   Well  of course I believe in God  but you know  I don't like that word 'heart ' because it anthropomorphizes God  and I don't like the word  'his ' either  because that sexualizes God.  But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys  so after a very long  uncomfortable pause  I said   Yes  yes  I do. I feel very loved.  And they looked at each other and smiled  like that was the right answer. And then they said   Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet   And I said   Yes  I do.  And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said   Well  then we have a story to tell you.  And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi  who lived in Jerusalem in     BC. Now  apparently in Jerusalem in     BC  everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them  man  woman  child  infant  fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him   Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.  And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said   America  From Jerusalem to America by boat in     BC   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced  and over the course of     years  there were two great races of them  the Nephites and the Lamanites  and the Nephites were totally good    each and every one of them    and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil    every single one of them just bad to the bone. Then  after Jesus died on the cross for our sins  on his way up to heaven  he stopped by America and visited the Nephites. And he told them that if they all remained totally  totally good    each and every one of them    they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it  because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy  this guy named Mormon  who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates  which he then buried near Palmyra  New York. Well  I was just on the edge of my seat. I said   What happened to the Lamanites   And they said   Well  they became our Native Americans  here in the U.S.  And I said   So  you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil   And they said   Yes.  Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard  and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into  and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English. Well  at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch. I wanted to say     Ok  don't start with this story.  I mean  even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start    telling people all about Xenu  the evil intergalactic overlord. Then  they said   Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets   And I said   No  I don't   because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story  but the truth was  I hadn't really thought this through  so I backpedaled a little and I said   Well  what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'  And what do you mean by prophets  Like  could the prophets be women   And they said   No.  And I said   Why   And they said   Well  it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular  it is so wonderful  that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.  What is this wonderful gift God gave women  I wondered  Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt  Women's longer lifespan  The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men  But no    it wasn't any of these gifts. They said   Well  it's her ability to bear children.  I said   Oh  come on. I mean  even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were    to the time they were     assuming they didn't die from exhaustion  it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.  And they said   No.  Well  then they didn't look so fresh faced and cute to me any more  but they had more to say. They said   Well  we also believe that if you're a Mormon  and if you're in good standing with the church  when you die  you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.  And I said   Oh  dear. That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.  And they said   Oh. Hey  Well  we also believe that when you go to heaven  you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like  if you'd lost a leg  well  you get it back. Or  if you'd gone blind  you could see.  I said   Oh. Now  I don't have a uterus  because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven  I would get my old uterus back   And they said   Sure.  And I said   I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.  Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it  Would God force you to get your old nose back  Then they gave me this Book of Mormon  told me to read this chapter and that chapter  and said they'd come back and check in on me  and I think I said something like   Please don't hurry   or maybe just   Please don't   and they were gone. Ok  so I initially felt really superior to these boys  and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it  the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time  and they said   We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse  and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.   And she had a baby  and that's the son of God   I mean  I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story. So  I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head  Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart  Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now  if they had asked me   Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart   Well  that would have been much different  I think I would have instantly answered   Yes  yes  I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused  and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits  and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.  But since they asked me that question with the word  believe  in it  somehow it was all different  because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt. I'm often asked   What surprised you about the book   And I say   That I got to write it.  I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think    I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked   Why do you think so many people have read this  This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.  And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point  we put our heads down on the pillow and we go   There's got to be more to life than this.  Get up in the morning  go to work  come home and watch TV  go to bed  get up in the morning  go to work  come home  watch TV  go to bed  go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say   I'm living.  No  you're not living    that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said  I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you  but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents  there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter. I think you matter to God  I think you matter to history  I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living  the success level of living  and the significance level of living is  Do you figure out   What on Earth am I here for   I meet a lot of people who are very smart  and say   But why can't I figure out my problems   And I meet a lot of people who are very successful  who say   Why don't I feel more fulfilled  Why do I feel like a fake  Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am   I think that comes down to this issue of meaning  of significance  of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of   Why am I here  What am I here for  Where am I going   These are not religious issues. They're human issues. I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does  because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor  I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that  but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks  there are smart kooks  dumb kooks. There are people    a lady came up to me the other day  and she had a white piece of paper    Michael  you'll like this one    and she said   What do you see in it   And I looked at it and I said   Oh  I don't see anything.  And she goes   Well  I see Jesus   and started crying and left. I'm going   OK   you know   Fine.  Good for you. When the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years  I kind of had my little crisis. And that was  What is the purpose of this  Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best selling book in the world  it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention  neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church  I was    years old. I started it with one other family in     . And I decided that I was never going to go on TV  because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a  quote   evangelist  televangelist     that's not my thing. And all of the sudden  it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think    now  this is a worldview  and I will tell you  everybody's got a worldview. Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something  you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So  everybody's betting their life on something. And when I  you know  made a bet  I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society  everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church  you know  I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book  and all of a sudden  it just took off  and I started saying  now  what's the purpose of this  Because as I started to say  I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego  ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is   It's not about you   then  when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history  you've got to figure  well  I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no brainer. So  what is it for  And I began to think about what I call the  stewardship of affluence  and the  stewardship of influence.  So I believe  essentially  leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area    in business  in politics  in sports  in art  in academics  in any area    you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance  that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born  it's not going to be mine after I die  I'm just here for    years and then that's it. I was debating the other day on a talk show  and the guy was challenging me and he'd go   What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment   And I asked this guy  I said   Well  do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation  Do you think we have a stewardship here  to take the environment seriously   And he said   No.  I said   Oh  you don't   I said   Let me make this clear again  Do you believe that as human beings    I'm not talking about religion    do you believe that as human beings  it is our responsibility to take care of this planet  and make it just a little bit better for the next generation   And he said   No. Not any more than any other species.  When he said the word  species   he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying   I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.  Well now  I know a lot of times we act like ducks  but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible    that's my worldview. And so  you need to understand what your worldview is. The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it  and say   This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.  I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may  you may. Your worldview  though  does determine everything else in your life  because it determines your decisions  it determines your relationships  it determines your level of confidence. It determines  really  everything in your life. What we believe  obviously    and you know this    determines our behavior  and our behavior determines what we become in life. So all of this money started pouring in  and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going  what do I do with this  My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said   First  we're not going to use it on ourselves.  I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year old Ford that I've driven. We just said  we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was  I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is  I added up all that the church had paid me over the last    years  and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money    I don't. In fact  personally  I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype  I've never met one of them. Believe me  there's a whole lot easier ways to make money. Pastors are like on    hours a day call  they're like doctors. I left late today    I'd hoped to be here yesterday    because my father in law is in his last  probably     hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life    he's now in his mid   s    and he's dying with peace. You know  the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals  it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe. So  we gave it all back  and then we set up three foundations  working on some of the major problems of the world  illiteracy  poverty  pandemic diseases    particularly HIV AIDS    and set up these three foundations  and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call  reverse tithers.  And that is  when my wife and I got married    years ago  we started tithing. Now  that's a principle in the Bible that says give    percent of what you get back to charity  give it away to help other people. So  we started doing that  and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So  our first year of marriage we went to    percent  second year we went to    percent  and the third year we went to    percent  and on and on and on. Why did I do that  Because every time I give  it breaks the grip of materialism in my life. Materialism is all about getting    get  get  get  get all you can  can all you get  sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more  having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good    that's most important of all    looking good  feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those  and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy  then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know  personally  I know  is not true. It's just not true. So  the good life is not about looking good  feeling good or having the goods  it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status  because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning  we find significance. That's the way we were wired  I believe  by God. And so we began to give away  and now after    years  my wife and I are reverse tithers    we give away    percent and live on   . That  actually  was the easy part. The hard part is  what do I do with all this attention  Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month long speaking tour on three different continents  and I won't go into that  but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going  what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought  And  being a pastor  I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm     and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer  it sounds incredibly selfish  self centered. He says   God  I want you to make me famous.  That's what he prays. He said   I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land  I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous  I want you to give me influence.  And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make  if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm  the whole chapter. And then he says   So that the king ...     he was the king of Israel at that time  at its apex in power     ... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan  support the oppressed  defend the defenseless  care for the sick  assist the poor  speak up for the foreigner  those in prison.  Basically  he's talking about all the marginalized in society. And as I read that  I looked at it  and I thought  you know  what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And  by the way  your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit  I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America    a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never  ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now  they're    miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say  ok  I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those. You know  there's a story in the Bible about Moses  whether you believe it's true or not  it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses  if you saw the movie   The Ten Commandments   Moses goes out  and there's this burning bush  and God talks to him  and God says   Moses  what's in your hand   I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked  What's in your hand  Moses says   It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.  And God says   Throw it down.  And if you saw the movie  you know  he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says   Pick it up.  And he picks it back up again  and it becomes a staff again. Now  I'm reading this thing  and I'm going  what is that all about  OK. What's that all about  Well  I do know a couple of things. Number one  God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just   Wow  isn't that cool   And  by the way  my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know  if God's going to show up  he's not going to show up on cheese bread. Ok  I just  this is why I love what Michael does  because it's like  if he's debunking it  then I don't have to. But God    my God    doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off. Second thing is  if God ever asks you a question  he already knows the answer. Obviously  if he's God  then that would mean that when he asks the question  it's for your benefit  not his. So he's going   What's in your hand   Now  what was in Moses' hand  Well  it was a shepherd's staff. Now  follow me on this. This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First  it represented his identity  he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation  I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity  his career  his job. Second  it's a symbol of not only his identity  it's a symbol of his income  because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days  nobody had bank accounts  or American Express cards  or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity  and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing  it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff  Well  you know  you move sheep from point A to point B with it  by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So  he's saying   You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand  You've got identity  you've got income  you've got influence. What's in your hand   And he's saying   If you lay it down  I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.  And if you've watched that movie   Ten Commandments   all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff. Last year  I was invited to speak at the NBA All Stars game. And so  I'm talking to the players  because most of the NBA teams  NFL teams and all the other teams have done this    Days of Purpose  based on the book. And I asked them  I said   What's in your hand  So  what's in your hand   I said   It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity  who you are  you're an NBA player. It represents your income  you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years  you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So  what are you going to do with what you've been given   And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today  to all of you very bright people at TED    it is to say   What's in your hand   What do you have that you've been given  Talent  background  education  freedom  networks  opportunities  wealth  ideas  creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given  That  to me  is the primary question about life. That  to me  is what being purpose driven is all about. In the book  I talk about how you're wired to do certain things  you're  SHAPED  with    a little acrostic  Spiritual gifts  Heart  Ability  Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life  you need to look at your shape     What am I wired to do   Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it  If you're wired to be an anthropologist  you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer  you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals  you make deals. If you're wired to paint  you paint. Did you know that God smiles when you be you  When my little kids    when my kids were little    they're all grown now  I have grandkids    I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed  and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower  rise and lower. And I would look at them   This is not an accident.  Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing  quote   spiritual things   like going to church or helping the poor  or  you know  confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is  God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why  He made you. And when you do what you were made to do  he goes   That's my boy  That's my girl  You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.  So my advice to you is  look at what's in your hand    your identity  your influence  your income    and say   It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.  Thank you. It's wonderful to be back. I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering   What on earth  Have they put up the wrong slide   No  no. Look at this magnificent beast  and ask the question  Who designed it  This is TED  this is Technology  Entertainment  Design  and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking  how do I introduce this  And I thought  well  maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer  you know   Poems are made by fools like me  but only God can make a tree.  And you might say   Well  God designed the cow.  But  of course  God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection  the process of natural selection  over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated  thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards  and  without even knowing what they were doing  they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were  how they worked and how they might be optimized    how they might be made better. Now  why am I talking about cows  Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena    they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base  just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED  and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years    really since the first time you saw me    some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion    and in the last four years  I've been working just about non stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea  I think  strikes terror in many people  or anger  or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break. I want to say  no  religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena  like global warming  as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed    brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And  as with the cow  there's a mixture of evolutionary design    designed by natural selection itself    and intelligent design    more or less intelligent design    and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions. You don't do book talks at TED  but I'm going to have just one slide about my book  because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book  at this time  when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today. Here's my proposal  I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  Education on world religions for all of our children    in primary school  in high school  in public schools  in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is  just as we require reading  writing  arithmetic  American history  so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world    about their history  about their creeds  about their texts  their music  their symbolisms  their prohibitions  their requirements. And this should be presented factually  straightforwardly  with no particular spin  to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that  you can teach them anything else you like. That  I think  is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions  then you may    and as early as you like and whatever you like    teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions. Now  why do I say that  Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip  it doesn't count  really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now  children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents    I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used    parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world  to the state  to them  to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important  but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world  too. The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it  totalitarian.  It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading  writing and arithmetic  I don't think so. All I'm saying is    and facts  facts only  no values  just facts    about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it  hilarious.  Well  I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible  natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that    any reactions to that    later. But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture  which I pulled off the web    the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards    they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep  too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds  Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems  protection from predators  food finding ... ... health maintenance. The only cost in most flocks    not even this    a loss of free mating. What a deal   How clever of sheep   you might say. Except  of course  it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists    they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it  It was the clever move of natural selection itself. Francis Crick  the co discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson  once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist  brilliant guy  and Orgel's Second Rule is  Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now  that is not Intelligent Design    not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule  then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax. The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant  unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose  without foresight  without design. When I was here four years ago  I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story. And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there  somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is  you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature  but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question  Was domestication good for sheep  It was great for their genetic fitness. And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said   Ten thousand years ago  at the dawn of agriculture  human population  plus livestock and pets  was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.  That was just        years ago. Yesterday  in biological terms. What is it today  Does anybody remember what he told us     percent. That is what we have done on this planet. Now  I talked to Paul afterwards    I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this  and get the sources and so forth    and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good  I'm going to read it to you   Over billions of years on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex  improbable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans    a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature    have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.  We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that  The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is  I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in       perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever  as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated  what it was for and how it perpetuates itself. Actually  I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which    in that case    A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse  makes it fearless  so it runs out in the open  where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words  we have these hijackers    you've seen this slide before  from four years ago    a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior  on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness. Does that ever happen to us  Yes  it does    quite wonderfully. The Arabic word  Islam  means  submission.  It means  surrender of self interest to the will of Allah.  But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall    years ago. And on it  it says  in Latin   Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.  The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well  not quite. But in fact  Christians  too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes.  The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words  even if it doesn't make sense.  Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from  The Purpose Driven Life.  And I want to turn now  briefly  to talk about that book  which I've read. You've all got a copy  and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint  because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all  the goal    and you heard just now what the goal is    it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions  and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal  In itself  I'm sure we all agree  it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life  and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A  on this. Is the goal achieved  Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore  eat your heart out. Just exactly what Al is trying to do  Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means    how does he do it  It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes    updating them  quietly dropping obsolete features  putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years  and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this  you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page. Moreover  he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance  he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear  vivid  accessible  beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain. With me  everybody    you make another copy in your brain. Thank you. And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision  a Mark   version of his book.  The truth will set you free.  That's what it says in the Bible  and it's something that I want to live by  too. My problem is  some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint  that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage    it's very much what he said  anyway   If there was no God we would all be accidents  the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.  Now  I just do not believe that. By the way  I find    Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that  as I said  is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about. How about this   God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.  I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this   All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose  a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.  Well  that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here  I think   Wait a minute.  I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think   Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design  Is he endorsing creationism here   And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking   Well  I don't know  I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.  But then I read on  and I read this   First  Noah had never seen rain  because prior to the Flood  God irrigated the earth from the ground up.  I wish that sentence weren't in there  because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet  after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years  discourages people from scientific understanding. Now  Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way. Here's one   God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.  I think that's false. Now  maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one   For instance  your brain can store     trillion facts. Your mind can handle        decisions a second.  Well  it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true.  Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge  hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being    an inbuilt need to connect with God.  Well  the sense of which I agree with him  except I think it has an evolutionary explanation. And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral  if you want to have meaning in your life  you have to be an Intelligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think  on the contrary  that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to  Well  this is from  The Purpose Driven Life    The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass I rely on for direction  the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions  and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.  Well maybe  OK  but what's going to follow from this  And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line   Surrendered people obey God's word  even if it doesn't make sense.  And that's a problem.  Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are  having had thousands of years to practice.  Now  Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.  You don't like my interpretation  You've got a reasonable objection to it  Don't listen  don't listen  That's the Devil speaking.  This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have. I've got one more problem  then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.  In the Great Commission  Jesus said  'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father  the Son and the Holy Spirit  and teach them to do everything I've told you.'  The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one  not as beautiful as the others  it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions. Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions  when their holy books are telling them   Don't listen to the other side  that's just Satan talking    It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently  in front of a church   Good without God becomes zero.  Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea  popular as it is    not in this guise  but in general    is itself one of the main problems that we face. If you are like me  you know many wonderful  committed  engaged atheists  agnostics  who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So  I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct. Thanks very much for your attention.
