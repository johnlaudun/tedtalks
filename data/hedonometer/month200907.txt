I'll start with my favorite muse  Emily Dickinson  who said that wonder is not knowledge  neither is it ignorance. It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be  and a tradition we may have forgotten. And I think  when I listen to these incredible people here  I've been so inspired    so many incredible ideas  so many visions. And yet  when I look at the environment outside  you see how resistant architecture is to change. You see how resistant it is to those very ideas. We can think them out. We can create incredible things. And yet  at the end  it's so hard to change a wall. We applaud the well mannered box. But to create a space that never existed is what interests me  to create something that has never been  a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits. And I think that's really what architecture is based on. Architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil. It's based on wonder. And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities  the greatest spaces that we have had. And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story. By the way  it is a story that is told through its hard materials. But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities. If you think of the great buildings  of the cathedrals  of the temples  of the pyramids  of pagodas  of cities in India and beyond  you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea  but by people. So  anything that has been made can be unmade. Anything that has been made can be made better. There it is  the things that I really believe are of important architecture. These are the dimensions that I like to work with. It's something very personal. It's not  perhaps  the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners. But I think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings  to live in cities  to connect ourselves in a social space. And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward. It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future. You can be a general  a politician  an economist who is depressed  a musician in a minor key  a painter in dark colors. But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better. And it is that belief that I think drives society. And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us. And yet it is in times like this that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas  ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities. Think of the Empire State Building  the Rockefeller Center. They were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way. And yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy. So again  I am a believer in the expressive. I have never been a fan of the neutral. I don't like neutrality in life  in anything. I think expression. And it's like espresso coffee  you know  you take the essence of the coffee. That's what expression is. It's been missing in much of the architecture  because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered  the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion  that has no value. And yet  I believe it is the expression    expression of the city  expression of our own space    that gives meaning to architecture. And  of course  expressive spaces are not mute. Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know. Expressive spaces may disturb us. And I think that's also part of life. Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile  but to reach out across the abyss of history  to places we have never been  and would have perhaps been  had we not been so lucky. So again  radical versus conservative. Radical  what does it mean  It's something which is rooted  and something which is rooted deep in a tradition. And I think that is what architecture is  it's radical. It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms. It is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of  and a story that is certainly ongoing. It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending. It's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way. So again I am a believer in the radical architecture. You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation. It's like the old Las Vegas used to be. It's about conserving emotions  conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them. And I think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses. Therefore I believe it should not be cool. There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture. I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed. Life without emotion would really not be life. Even the mind is emotional. There is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere  in the philosophical mystery of what we are. So I think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space  into city life. And of course  we are all about the struggle of emotions. And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place. And of course  the confrontation of the cool  the unemotional with emotion  is a conversation that I think cities themselves have fostered. I think that is the progress of cities. It's not only the forms of cities  but the fact that they incarnate emotions  not just of those who build them  but of those who live there as well. Inexplicable versus understood. You know  too often we want to understand everything. But architecture is not the language of words. It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write. Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story  but the story is very short  which says   We have no story to tell you.  So the important thing actually  is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions  which might be totally inexplicable in words  because they operate in proportions  in materials  in light. They connect themselves into various sources  into a kind of complex vector matrix that isn't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives  and in the history of a city  and of a people. So again  the notion that a building should just be explicit I think is a false notion  which has reduced architecture into banality. Hand versus the computer. Of course  what would we be without computers  Our whole practice depends on computing. But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand  the hand should really be the driver of the computing power. Because I believe that the hand in all its primitive  in all its physiological obscurity  has a source  though the source is unknown  though we don't have to be mystical about it. We realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy. And I think when I draw drawings which may imitate the computer  but are not computer drawings    drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known  not normal  not seen  yet the hand    and that's what I really  to all of you who are working    how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer. I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is. Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it. Listening to all of you  the complexity of thought  the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming. And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture  You know  brain surgery  atomic theory  genetics  economics are complex complex fields. There is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple. It is complex. Space is complex. Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds. And as wondrous as it is  it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired. And yet  our lives are complex. Our emotions are complex. Our intellectual desires are complex. So I do believe that architecture as I see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have  in every intimacy that we possess. Of course that means that architecture is political. The political is not an enemy of architecture. The politeama is the city. It's all of us together. And I've always believed that the act of architecture  even a private house  when somebody else will see it  is a political act  because it will be visible to others. And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more. So again  the evasion of that sphere  which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture  the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me. And I do believe that this interaction with the history  with history that is often very difficult  to grapple with it  to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique. Because architecture is also the asking of questions. It's not only the giving of answers. It's also  just like life  the asking of questions. Therefore it is important that it be real. You know we can simulate almost anything. But the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart  the human soul. And architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere. So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual. It's not something that comes to us from books and theories. It's the real that we touch    the door  the window  the threshold  the bed    such prosaic objects. And yet  I try  in every building  to take that virtual world  which is so enigmatic and so rich  and create something in the real world. Create a space for an office  a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real. Unexpected versus habitual. What is a habit  It's just a shackle for ourselves. It's a self induced poison. So the unexpected is always unexpected. You know  it's true  the cathedrals  as unexpected  will always be unexpected. You know Frank Gehry's buildings  they will continue to be unexpected in the future. So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability  but an architecture that is full of tension  an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart  and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. And of course habits are enforced by architecture. When we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles  of those lights  of those materials. We think the world really looks like our buildings. And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them. So again  the unexpected which is also the raw. And I often think of the raw and the refined. What is raw  The raw  I would say is the naked experience  untouched by luxury  untouched by expensive materials  untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture. So the rawness  I think  in space  the fact that sustainability can actually  in the future translate into a raw space  a space that isn't decorated  a space that is not mannered in any source  but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature  might be refractive to our desires. A space that doesn't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us  but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities  other experiences  that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture. And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy. And so I do like something which is pointed  not blunt  something which is focused on reality  something that has the power  through its leverage  to transform even a very small space. So architecture maybe is not so big  like science  but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about. And often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done  what has been done  how the world has remained both in between stability and instability. And of course buildings have their shapes. Those shapes are difficult to change. And yet  I do believe that in every social space  in every public space  there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought  that blunt technique  but something that pinpoints  and can point in various directions forward  backward  sideways and around. So that is indeed what is memory. So I believe that my main interest is to memory. Without memory we would be amnesiacs. We would not know which way we were going  and why we are going where we're going. So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse  rehashing of the same things over and over again  which  of course  get accolades of critics. Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way. But I rather play something completely unheard of  and even with flaws  than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness. So again  memory is the city  memory is the world. Without the memory there would be no story to tell. There would be nowhere to turn. The memorable  I think  is really our world  what we think the world is. And it's not only our memory  but those who remember us  which means that architecture is not mute. It's an art of communication. It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires. It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available. It can reach into millennia that have been buried  and return them in a just and unexpected equity. So again  I think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me. Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city. Cities should be full of vibrations  full of sound  full of music. And that indeed is the architectural mission that I believe is important  is to create spaces that are vibrant  that are pluralistic  that can transform the most prosaic activities  and raise them to a completely different expectation. Create a shopping center  a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment. And these are our dreams. And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky. You know it costs a lot of money and so on  but yes  it should not play it safe. It should not play it safe  because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be. And I think  of course  risk is what underlies the world. World without risk would not be worth living. So yes  I do believe that the risk we take in every building. Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent. Risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying  as they should be  for a pioneering city. Risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws  into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready made thing. And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be. It's about space. It's not about fashion. It's not about decoration. It's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated  cannot be simulated in any other sphere. And there of course is the space that we need to breathe  is the space we need to dream. These are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us  but are important for everybody in this world. So again  it's not about the changing fashions  changing theories. It's about carving out a space for trees. It's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city. A space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density. And I think that is really the nature of architecture. Now I am a believer in democracy. I don't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes. Where people cannot speak  cannot vote  cannot do anything. We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful. And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people  I don't admire those buildings. So democracy  as difficult as it is  I believe in it. And of course  at Ground Zero what else  It's such a complex project. It's emotional. There is so many interests. It's political. There is so many parties to this project. There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power. There are emotions of the victims. And yet  in all its messiness  in all its difficulties  I would not have liked somebody to say   This is the tabula rasa  mister architect    do whatever you want.  I think nothing good will come out of that. I think architecture is about consensus. And it is about the dirty word  compromise.  Compromise is not bad. Compromise  if it's artistic  if it is able to cope with its strategies    and there is my first sketch and the last rendering    it's not that far away. And yet  compromise  consensus  that is what I believe in. And Ground Zero  despite all its difficulties  it's moving forward. It's difficult.           . Freedom Tower  the memorial. And that is where I end. I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others  looking at America from that point of view. This is America. This is liberty. This is what we dream about. Its individuality  demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience. And finally  it's the freedom that America represents  not just to me  as an immigrant  but to everyone in the world. Thank you. Chris Anderson  I've got a question. So have you come to peace with the process that happened at Ground Zero and the loss of the original  incredible design that you came up with  Daniel Libeskind  Look. We have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian  that we can determine everything that happens. We have to rely on others  and shape the process in the best way possible. I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser  not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight. You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win everything you want to win. But you can steer the process. And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero will be meaningful  will be inspiring  will tell other generations of the sacrifices  of the meaning of this event. Not just for New York  but for the world. Chris Anderson  Thank you so much  Daniel Libeskind. Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife. Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently  they're not brothers.  Laughter  And they were a lot of fun. You know  Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family. We are going to focus on Charles today  because it is Charles'    th birthday. But when I speak of him  I'm really speaking of both of them as a team. Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be     this June. We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do. The thing about their work is that most people come to the door of furniture    I suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others I'm going to show you. But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top. The whole thing about this  though  is that  you know  why am I showing it  Is it because Charles and Ray made this film  This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had. They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be. There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip. The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair. Video  This is the land. It has many contrasts. It is rough and it is flat. In places it is cold. In some it is hot. Too much rain falls on some areas  and not enough on others. But people live on this land. And  as in Russia  they are drawn together into towns and cities. Here is something of the way they live. Eames Demetrios  Now  this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States. It was on seven screens and it was     feet across. And it was at the height of the Cold War. The Nixon Khrushchev Kitchen Debate happened about    feet from where this was shown. And yet  how did it start  You know  commonality  the first line in Charles' narration was   The same stars that shine down on Russia shine down on the United States. From the sky  our cities look much the same.  It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything. And you can imagine  and the thing about it is  that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the images were about. So that was just a little snip. But the thing about Charles and Ray is that they were always modeling stuff. They were always trying things out. I think one of the things I am passionate about  my grandparents work  I'm passionate about my work  but on top of all that I'm passionate about a holistic vision of design  where design is a life skill  not a professional skill. And you know  those of us with kids often want our kids to take music. I'm no exception. But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman. It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking. Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way. And this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation. And Charles just checking it out there. So now we're going to go through that door of furniture. This is an unusual installation of airport seating. So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture. And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host  anticipating the needs of the guest. So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool. These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes  although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design. It's just the things you try out to kind of make it work better. And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs. Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like  Hey  why didn't they try that   It was that hands on iterative process which is so much like vernacular design and folk design in traditional cultures. And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next    or    years. The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design  they actually mean style. And I'm really here to talk about design. But you know the object is just a pivot. It's a pivot between a process and a system. And this is a little film I made about the making of the Eames lounge chair. The design process for Charles and Ray never ended in manufacturing. It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better. Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics. It's not enough to create one. You've got to create a system that will work better and better. So I've always liked this prototype picture. Because it just kind of  you know  doesn't get any more basic than that. You try things out. This is a relatively famous chair. Its early version had an  X  base. That's what the collectors like. Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better. It worked better   H  base  much more practical. This is something called a splint. And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's work for the military  or for the soldiers  because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it. And they'd been working on furniture before. But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process  which was incredibly important to them. I'm trying to show you too much  because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images. This is a house that Charles and Ray designed. My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me. Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary  it's not me. And then this is a film  on the lower left  that Charles and Ray made. Now look at that plastic chair. The house is     . The chair is done in     . Charles and Ray  they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake. They didn't say   Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy.  They didn't say   Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy.  They focused on the need. They tried to solve the design problem. Charles used to say   The extent to which you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem.  It's kind of a brutal quote. This is the earlier design of that house. And again  they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house    architecture  very expensive medium. Here's a film we've been hearing things about. The  Powers of Ten  is a film they made. If we watch the next clip  you're going to see the first version of  Powers of Ten   upper left. The familiar one on the lower right. The Eames' film Tops  lower left. And a lamp that Charles designed for a church. Video  Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies. These form part of a grouping system much as the stars do. They are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from Earth. ED  You've seen that film  and what's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale. Everybody here is coming at it from a different way. I want to give you one example. E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants    he loved them  of course  and he wanted to learn more about them    he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale. So here is the tiny creature. And yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much  including what ended up being the TED Prize. Modeling  they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things. And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding. And I think in our family we were very lucky  because we learned about design backwards. Design was not something other. It was part of the business of life in general. It was part of the quality of life. And here is some family pictures. And you can see why I'm down on style  with a haircut like that. But anyway   Laughter  I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid. So we're going to watch another film. This is a film  the one called Toys. You can see me  I have the same haircut  in the upper right corner. Upper left is a film they did on toy trains. Lower right is a solar do nothing toy. Lower left is Day of the Dead toys. Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear. They are often the precursor to bigger things. And these ideas    that train up there  being about the honest use of materials  is totally the same as the honest use of materials in the plywood. And now I'm going to test you. This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old. So can you read it  Lucia angel  okay  eye. Audience  Saw many trains. ED  Awl  also  good that the leather crafter's guild is here. Also  what is he doing  Row  rowed. Sun  No. Well is there another name for a sunrise  Dawn  very good. Also rode on one. I ... Audience  You had  I hope you had    ED  Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis in the late  in the mid     's  then you'd know that was a Great Dane. So  I hope you had a Audience  Nice time  time    ED  Time at. Citizen Kane  rose    Audience  Rosebud. ED  No  bud.  D 's right. At Buddy's    Audience  Party. Love. ED  Okay  good. So   I saw many trains and also rode on one. I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party.  So you guys did pretty good  cool. So my mom and Charles had this great relationship where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another. And it's all part of the  you know  they used to say   Take your pleasure seriously.  These are some images from a project of mine that's called Kymaerica. It's sort of an alternative universe. It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape. Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America. We're about to do six in the U.K. next week. And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world. So  of course  since it's bronze it has to be true. Video  Kymaerica with waterfalls  tumbling through our    ED  This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs. And so we had spelling bees in Paris  Illinois. Video  Your word is N. Carolina. Girl  Y I N D I A N A. ED  And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site  because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started  where there embassy was. So you can actually visit and have this three dimensional fictional experience there. And the town has really embraced it. We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club. But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable. And it's not. Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey. And we could have been born         years ago. And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench. They have trading cards and all sorts of cool things. And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica. The Tahatchabe  the great road building culture. A guy named Nobu Naga  the so called Japanese Columbus. But now I'm going to return you to the real world. And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you  which is the first film that Charles ever made. So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it. Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here. It's a film about Maya Gretel  a famous ceramicist  and a teacher at Cranbrook. And he made it for the      faculty exhibition. Silent. We don't have a track for it yet. Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn by doing thing. You want to learn how to make films  Go make a movie. And you try something out. But here is what's really great. See that chair there  The orange one  That's the organic chair.     . At the same time that Charles was doing that chair  he was doing this film. So my point is that this scope of vision  this holistic vision of design  was with them from the beginning. It wasn't like  Oh  we made some chairs and got successful. Now we're going to do some movies.  It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful. And I think that all of us in this room  as you move design forward  it's not about just doing one thing. It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge  beautiful commonality between design  business and the world. So we're going to do the last clip. And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now. So this is Charles' voice. Charles Eames  In India  those without  and the lowest in caste  eat very often  particularly in southern India  they eat off of a banana leaf. And those a little bit up the scale eat off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish. And a little bit higher  why they have a glaze on a thing they call a thali. If you're up the scale a little bit more  why  a brass thali. And then things get to be a little questionable. There are things like silver plated thalis. And there is solid silver thalis. And I suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he's eaten off of. But you can go beyond that. And the guys that have not only means  but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding  go to the next step  and they eat off a banana leaf. And I think that in these times when we fall back and regroup  that somehow or other  the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there  because I'm not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of. But it is that process that has happened within the man that changes the banana leaf. ED  I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you. Because that's part of where we've got to get to. And I also want to share this one.  Beyond the age of information is the age of choices.  And I really think that's where we are. And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in     . And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important  is that these are the ideas we need. And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey. That's what we all need to do. Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style. All that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems. I really thank you for your time. Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz. And the Big Viz is a collection of     sketches that were made by two visual artists. David Sibbet from The Grove  and Kevin Richards  from Autodesk  made     sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas. And the consensus was  it really worked. These sketches brought to life the key ideas  the portraits  the magic moments that we all experienced last year. This year we were thinking   Why does it work   What is it about animation  graphics  illustrations  that create meaning  And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning  the better we can communicate  and  I also think  the better we can think and collaborate together. So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes. Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is  but instead  creates a series of mental models through a collection of  Ah ha moments   or moments of discovery  through various processes. The processing  of course  begins with the eyes. Light enters  hits the back of the retina  and is circulated  most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain  at the primary visual cortex. And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry  just the simplest of shapes. But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain. As many as    other parts that selectively make more sense  create more meaning through the kind of  Ah ha  experiences. We're only going to talk about three of them. So the first one is called the ventral stream. It's on this side of the brain. And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is. It's the  what  detector. Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book. So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something. A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream. And what it does is locates the object in physical body space. So if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage. And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it. You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that. The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system. And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old  evolutionarily. And it's the part that feels. It's the kind of gut center  where you see an image and you go   Oh  I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing.  So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways. So what can we learn about this  How can we apply this insight  Well  again  the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at. The brain processes this in parallel  the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model. So  for example  when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around  to selectively create a visual logic. So the act of engaging  and looking at the image creates the meaning. It's the selective logic. Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information. Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall. And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas. So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning. It activates a different part of the brain. And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion  when we see color  and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before. So the point of this is what  We make meaning by seeing  by an act of visual interrogation. The lessons for us are three fold. First  use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate. Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully. And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence. These are techniques that can be used to be    that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving. So the low tech version looks like this. And  by the way  this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk  in some of our organizations and some of our divisions. What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall. And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else. There's always a room  always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan. This is a time lapse view of it. You can ask the question   Who's the boss   You'll be able to figure that out.  Laughter  So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration. No Powerpoint is used in two days. But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on. And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology. And this is our great unveiling for today. And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible. Here what we can do is look at sustainability  quite literally. So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen. So making images meaningful has three components. The first again  is making ideas clear by visualizing them. Secondly  making them interactive. And then thirdly  making them persistent. And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today. Thanks so much. I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war. But today I've got a personal story to share with you. This is a picture of my family  my four siblings    my mom and I    taken in     . And we're actually Cambodians. And this picture is taken in Vietnam. So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in       Well to explain that  I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during      and     . Video  April   th      . The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam  and American bombing campaigns. Led by peasant born Pol Pot  the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia  much like Mao Tse tung's Cultural Revolution in China. The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world. But after four years the grim truth seeps out. In a country of only seven million people  one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders  their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. Sophal Ear  So  notwithstanding the     s narration  on April   th      we lived in Phnom Penh. And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days. And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge. They were young soldiers  typically child soldiers. And this is very normal now  of modern day conflict  because they're easy to bring into wars. The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off. I mean  from      to      there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan  including the two nuclear bombs of August     . The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money. So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed. But not just that  they actually banned money. I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used. And we know money is the root of all evil  but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia  in fact. My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province. This is a picture of what Pursat looks like. It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia  where rice growing takes place. And in fact they were forced to work the fields. So my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp  labor camp. And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam. And she spoke some Vietnamese  as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends. And she decided  despite the advice of her neighbors  that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive  because at this point they're forcing everybody to work. And they're giving about    in a modern day  caloric restriction diet  I guess    they're giving porridge  with a few grains of rice. And at about this time actually my father got very sick. And he didn't speak Vietnamese. So he died actually  in January     . And it made it possible  in fact  for us to take on this plan. So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev  which is across from the border from Vietnam. And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested  language tested. And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible  she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names. But she'd given the boys girls' names  and the girls boys' names. And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this  and then tutored her for two days intensively  that she was able to go into her exam and    you know  this was a moment of truth. If she fails  we're all headed to the gallows  if she passes  we can leave to Vietnam. And she actually  of course    I'm here  she passes. And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side. And then onwards to Chau Doc. And this is a picture of Hong Ngu  Vietnam today. A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta. But for us it meant freedom. And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. Last year  the Khmer Rouge Tribunal  which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on  started  and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father's passing away. And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. And it's for me a matter of justice for history  and accountability for the future  because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place  at times. Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc. And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom  but also fear  because we had just come out of Cambodia. I'm happy  actually  today  to present her. She's here today with us in the audience. Thank you mother. So it was about four years ago  five years ago  I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia  I think it was  with a bag similar to this. And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag. And I was saying  you don't know this molecule really well  but your body knows it extremely well. And I was thinking that your body hated it  at the time  because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha gal epitope. And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. Actually our body doesn't hate these. Our body loves these. It eats them. I mean  the cells in our immune system are always hungry. And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell  it means  that's food.  Now  I was thinking about that and I said  you know  we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make  and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff. But I said we can't get rid of it  because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity. And I said  why don't you use that  What if I could stick this molecule  slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me  that had just invaded my lungs  I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there  where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it    it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on. It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you  like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.  and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car  and then charges you for possession of marijuana. It's like this very fast  very efficient way to get people off the street. So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all  and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street. And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore. Our antibiotics are running out. And  I mean  the world apparently is running out too. So probably it doesn't matter    years from now    streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant    because we won't be here. But if we are    we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. So I started working with this thing  with a bunch of collaborators. And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones  bacteria that we don't like. And I feel now like George Bush. It's like  mission accomplished.  So I might be doing something dumb  just like he was doing at the time. But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work. And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them. This thing can be stuck  like that little green triangle up there  sort of symbolizing this right now. You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer. And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it. So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like  like Staphylococcus    I don't like it in particular  because it killed a professor friend of mine last year. It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it. And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it. That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body  and will alert your immune system to go after it. Here's what happened. See that line on the very top with the little dots  That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas  at Brooks Air Base  with anthrax. And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular  and direct your immune system to it. You'll notice they all lived  the ones on the top line    that's a     percent survival rate. And they actually lived another    days  or    when we finally killed them  and took them apart and figured out what went wrong. Why did they not die  And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore. So we did it. Okay  Mission accomplished  Because of what I'm about to say  I really should establish my green credentials. When I was a small boy  I took my pledge as an American  to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country  its air  soil and minerals  its forests  waters and wildlife. And I've stuck to that. Stanford  I majored in ecology and evolution.       I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was  mister natural  for a while. And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration. The Brown administration  and a bunch of my friends  basically leveled the energy efficiency of California  so it's the same now     years later  even though our economy has gone up    percent  per capita. And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state. California is basically the equivalent of Europe  in this. This year  Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today  called Whole Earth Discipline. The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on. By mid century we'll be about    percent urban  and that's mostly in the developing world  where that's happening. It's interesting  because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities. The developing world now has all of the biggest cities  and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries  and nine times bigger. It's qualitatively different. They are the drivers of history  as we see by looking at history.       years ago this is what the world looked like. Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had       years ago. In other words  the rise of the West  dramatic as it was  is over. The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming   .  million people a week coming to town  decade after decade. What's really going on  Well  what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out. Subsistence farming is drying up basically. People are following opportunity into town. And this is why. I used to have a very romantic idea about villages  and it's because I never lived in one. Because in town    this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera  near Nairobi    they see action. They see opportunity. They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm. As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics. There is plenty going on. They are poor  but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative. The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters  all one billion of them  are building the urban world  which means they're building the world    personally  one by one  family by family  clan by clan  neighborhood by neighborhood. They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by. They even build their own infrastructure. Well  steal their own infrastructure  at first. Cable TV  water  the whole gamut  all gets stolen. And then gradually gentrifies. It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity  not the working slums  they help create prosperity. So in a town like Mumbai  which is half slums  it's    th of the GDP of India. Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense. These people are valuable as a group. And that's how they work. There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people   Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing.  It used to be   Oh we've got to get them phone service.  Now they're showing us how they do their phone service. Famine mostly is a rural event now. There are things they care about. And this is where we can help. And the nations they're in can help. And they are helping each other solve these issues. And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai. You look at that lane on the right. And you can ask   Okay what's going on there   The answer is   Everything.  This is better than a mall. It's much denser. It's much more interactive. And the scale is terrific. The main event is  these are not people crushed by poverty. These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can. They're helping each other do it. They're doing it through an outlaw thing  the informal economy. The informal economy  it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics  it's not supposed to be there  but it's huge. We don't understand how it works yet  but we have to. Furthermore  people in the informal economy  the gray economy    as time goes by  crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world  or they can join the legitimate world. We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world  because if we don't  they will go toward the criminal world. There's all kinds of activity. In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself  but it performs services for the city at large. And one of the main events are these ad hoc schools. Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private  tiny  unofficial school. Education is more possible in the cities  and that changes the world. So you see some interesting  typical  urban things. So one thing slammed up against another  such as in Sao Paulo here. That's what cities do. That's how they create value  is by slamming things together. In this case  supply right next to demand. So the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work  in the boring  rich neighborhood. Proximity is amazing. We are learning about how dense proximity can be. Connectivity between the city and the country is what's going to keep the country good  because the city has interesting ways of doing things. This is what makes cities    this is what makes cities so green in the developing world. Because people leave the poverty trap  an ecological disaster of subsistence farms  and head to town. And when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly. And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town. So if you want to save a village  you do it with a good road  or with a good cell phone connection  and ideally some grid electrical power. So the event is  we're a city planet. That just happened. More than half. The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now. Another billion is expected. That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way. And that will determine a lot of how we function. Now  for us environmentalists  maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb. People get into town. The immediately have fewer children. They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer  higher quality kids  and the birthrate goes down radically. Very interesting side effect here  here's a slide from Phillip Longman. Shows what is happening. As we have more and more old people  like me  and fewer and fewer babies. And they are regionally separated. What you're getting is a world which is old folks  and old cities  going around doing things the old way  in the north. And young people in brand new cities they're inventing  doing new things  in the south. Where do you think the action is going to be  Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate. The climate news  I'm sorry to say  is going to keep getting worse than we think  faster than we think. Climate is a profoundly complex  nonlinear system  full of runaway positive feedbacks  hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points. Here's just a few samples. We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones. From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades  and what goes along with that  which is resource wars and chaos wars  as we're seeing in Darfur. That's what drought does. It brings carrying capacity down  and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble. Shift to the power situation. Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city  or a city planet. So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity  coal  some gas  nuclear and hydro. Of those  only nuclear and hydro are green. Coal is what is causing the climate problems. And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap  until governments make it expensive. Wind and solar can't help  because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. So with hydro maxed out  coal and lose the climate  or nuclear  which is the current operating low carbon source  and maybe save the climate. And if we can eventually get good solar in space  that also could help. Because remember  this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities. So  between coal and nuclear  compare their waste products. If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear  the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can. Whereas a coal burning plant  a normal one gigawatt coal plant  burns    rail cars of coal a day  each car having     tons. And it puts    thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air. So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms  nuclear is about even with solar and wind  and ahead of solar    oh  I'm sorry    with hydro and wind  and ahead of solar. And does nuclear really compete with coal  Just ask the coal miners in Australia. That's where you see some of the source  not from my fellow environmentalists  but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power. Well the good news is that the developing world  but frankly  the whole world  is busy building  and starting to build  nuclear reactors. This is good for the atmosphere. It's good for their prosperity. I want to point out one interesting thing  which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower. It's supposed to be  I don't know  local solar and wind and cogeneration  and good things like that. But frankly micro reactors which are just now coming on  might serve even better. The Russians  who started this  are building floating reactors  for their new passage  where the ice is melting  north of Russia. And they're selling these floating reactors  only    megawatts  to developing countries. Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba. It's interesting  say  to take a    megawatt     million watts  and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva  which is  .    .  billion watts. These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable. Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab. Here's another American design that came out of Los Alamos  and is now commercial. Almost all of these are not only small  they are proliferation proof. They're typically buried in the ground. And the innovation is moving very rapidly. So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future. In terms of proliferation  nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity. And that's why    percent of the electricity in this room     percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear. Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia  soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads. And so I would like to see the GNEP program  that was developed in the Bush administration  go forward aggressively. And I was glad to see that president Obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in Prague the other week. One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops  in my view  as a biologist  have no reason to be controversial. My fellow environmentalists  on this subject  have been irrational  anti scientific  and very harmful. Despite their best efforts  genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history. They're good for the environment because they enable no till farming  which leaves the soil in place  getting healthier from year to year    slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere. They reduce pesticide use. And they increase yield  which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller  and therefore more wild area is freed up. By the way  this map from      is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace  and Friends of the Earth from Europe  and they're finally getting out from under that. And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa  at last. This is a moral issue. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available. Speaking of imperatives  geoengineering is taboo now  especially in government circles  though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago  but it will be on your plate    not this year but pretty soon  because some harsh realizations are coming along. This is a list of them. Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary. There will be events  like        people dying of a heat wave  which happened a while back. Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh. Like wars over water  such as in the Indus. And as those events keep happening we're going to say   Okay  what can we do about that really   But there's this little problem with geoengineering  what body is going to decide who gets to engineer  How much they do  Where they do it  Because everybody is downstream  downwind of whatever is done. And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization. But if we just say  OK  China  you're worried  you go ahead. You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way.  That would be considered an act of war by both nations. So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along. I should say  it is more practical than people think. Here is an example that climatologists like a lot  one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas. This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in         cooled the earth by half a degree. There was so much ice in       the following year  that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the Pinatubo cubs. To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year. That's nothing  compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy. Just to run by another one  this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds  by atomizing seawater  that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet. A nice one  because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places  is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing  smoldering  plant waste  and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil. So here is where we are. Nobel Prize winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene  the human dominated era. We are stuck with its obligations. In the Whole Earth Catalog  my first words were   We are as Gods  and might as well get good at it.  The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are   We are as Gods  and have to get good at it.  Thank you. I have a studio in Berlin    let me cue on here    which is down there in this snow  just last weekend. In the studio we do a lot of experiments. I would consider the studio more like a laboratory. I have occasional meetings with scientists. And I have an academy  a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin. We have an annual gathering of people  and that is called Life in Space. Life in Space is really not necessarily about how we do things  but why we do things. Do you mind looking  with me  at that little cross in the center there  So just keep looking. Don't mind me. So you will have a yellow circle  and we will do an after image experiment. When the circle goes away you will have another color  the complementary color. I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back. This whole idea of sharing  the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what I say and what you say    think of a movie. Since two years now  with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin  I've been working on these films where we produce the film together. I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting. Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative. But nevertheless  what the potential is    and just keep looking there    what the potential is  obviously  is to kind of move the border of who is the author  and who is the receiver. Who is the consumer  if you want  and who has responsibility for what one sees  I think there is a socializing dimension in  kind of  moving that border. Who decides what reality is  This is the Tate Modern in London. The show was  in a sense  about that. It was about a space in which I put half a semi circular yellow disk. I also put a mirror in the ceiling  and some fog  some haze. And my idea was to make the space tangible. With such a big space  the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace  and what the space  in that sense  is. So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements  if you want    some fog    I could make the space tangible. And what happens is that people  they start to see themselves in this space. So look at this. Look at the girl. Of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum. Right  That's how museums are working today. But look at her face there  as she's checking out  looking at herself in the mirror.  Oh  That was my foot there   She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not. And in that whole idea  how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space  How do we reconfigure it  How do we know that being in a space makes a difference  Do you see when I said in the beginning  it's about why  rather than how  The why meant really   What consequences does it have when I take a step    What does it matter    Does it matter if I am in the world or not    And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take filter into a sense of responsibility   Is art about that  I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world  and making it look even better  or even worse  if you ask me. It's obviously also about taking responsibility  like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river in L.A.  Stockholm  Norway and Tokyo  among other places. The green dye is not environmentally dangerous  but it obviously looks really rather frightening. And it's on the other side also  I think  quite beautiful  as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas  in these different places of the world. The  Green river   as a kind of activist idea  not a part of an exhibition  it was really about showing people  in this city  as they walk by  that space has dimensions. A space has time. And the water flows through the city with time. The water has an ability to make the city negotiable  tangible. Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not. It makes a difference whether you say   I'm a part of this city. And if I vote it makes a difference. If I take a stand  it makes a difference.  This whole idea of a city not being a picture is  I think  something that art  in a sense  always was working with. The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what it means to be in a picture  and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference  The difference between thinking and doing. So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them. Iceland  lower right corner  my favorite place. These kinds of experiments  they filter into architectural models. These are ongoing experiments. One is an experiment I did for BMW  an attempt to make a car. It's made out of ice. A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top  which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland. A sort of a run track  or a walk track  on the top of a museum in Denmark  which is made of colored glass  going all around. So the movement with your legs will change the color of your horizon. And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London  with the Serpentine Gallery  a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion. This summer  in New York  there is one thing about falling water which is very much about the time it takes for water to fall. It's quite simple and fundamental. I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland. And as you come to a new valley  as you come to a new landscape  you have a certain view. If you stand still  the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is. It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at. The moment you start to move  the mountain starts to move. The big mountains far away  they move less. The small mountains in the foreground  they move more. And if you stop again  you wonder   Is that a one hour valley  Or is that a three hour hike  or is that a whole day I'm looking at   If you have a waterfall in there  right out there at the horizon  you look at the waterfall and you go   Oh  the water is falling really slowly.  And you go   My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall.  If a waterfall is falling faster  it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by    because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere. And your body somehow knows that. So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space. Of course being an iconic city like New York  that has had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space  you could say that New York wants to seem as big as possible. Adding a measurement to that is interesting  the falling water suddenly gives you a sense of   Oh  Brooklyn is exactly this much    the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan  in this case the lower East River is this big.  So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities. It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension. And why would we want to do that  Because I think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space  rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture. And  Ha ha  there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter   Is there a sense of consequences  So if I have a sense of the space  if I feel that the space is tangible  if I feel there is time  if there is a dimension I could call time  I also feel that I can change the space. And suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible. One could say this is about community  collectivity. It's about being together. How do we create public space  What does the word  public  mean today anyway  So  asked in that way  I think it raises great things about parliamentary ideas  democracy  public space  being together  being individual. How do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality  and also to collectivity  without polarizing the two into two different opposites  Of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed  polarizing the two against each other into different  very normative ideas. I would claim that art and culture  and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting in the times we're living in now  have proven that one can create a kind of a space which is both sensitive to individuality and to collectivity. It's very much about this causality  consequences. It's very much about the way we link thinking and doing. So what is between thinking and doing  And right in between thinking and doing  I would say  there is experience. And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non casual way. Experience is about responsibility. Having an experience is taking part in the world. Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility. So art  in that sense  I think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into  particularly right now. That's all I have. Thank you very much. So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation. Now  inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year  I didn't bring a human brain  but I did bring a liter of bone marrow. And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients  most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases. So  a few years ago  I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford. I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here  who is a volunteer donor. We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia. So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow  Well we have a whole O.R. team  general anesthesia  nurses  and another doctor across from me. Bob's on the table  and we take this sort of small needle  you know  not too big. And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue  and kind of punch it into the hard bone  into the tuchus    that's a technical term    and aspirate about    mls of bone marrow out  each time  with a syringe. And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin. Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again. About     times usually. And by the end of this my arm is sore  I've got a callus on my hand  let alone Bob  whose rear end looks something more like this  like Swiss cheese. So I'm thinking  you know  this procedure hasn't changed in about    years. And there is probably a better way to do this. So I thought of a minimally invasive approach  and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner. This is it. And the Marrow Miner  the way it works is shown here. Our standard see through patient. Instead of entering the bone dozens of times  we enter just once  into the front of the hip or the back of the hip. And we have a flexible  powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip  as it moves around. So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate  or suck out  rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole. We can do multiple passes through that same entry. No robots required. And  so  very quickly  Bob can just get one puncture  local anesthesia  and do this harvest as an outpatient. So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford. And played around with this a little bit. And our team members developed this technology. And eventually we got two large animals  and pig studies. And we found  to our surprise  that we not only got bone marrow out  but we got    times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner  compared to the normal device. This device was just FDA approved in the last year. Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around. There will be two passes here  in the same patient  from the same hole. This was done under local anesthesia  as an outpatient. And we got  again  about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient. So why should you care  Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells. You all know about embryonic stem cells. They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials. Adult stem cells are throughout our body  including the blood forming stem cells in our bone marrow  which we've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over    years. In the last decade there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease  vascular disease  orthopedics  tissue engineering  even in neurology to treat Parkinson's and diabetes. We've just come out  we're commercializing  this year  generation  .  of the Marrow Miner. The hope is that this gets more stem cells out  which translates to better outcomes. It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors. It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells  when you're younger and healthier  to use in the future should you need it. And ultimately    and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors  who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford. Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future. Thanks. I'm a neuroscientist  a professor at the University of California. And over the past    years  I've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters  dopamine  things like that  all the way through circuit analysis. So that's what I normally do. But then  for some reason  I got into something else  just recently. And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers. And so this would be the typical talk I would give. And the question is   How do you end up with a psychopathic killer   What I mean by psychopathic killer are these people  these types of people. And so some of the brains that I've studied are people you know about. When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at. It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything. So I've looked at about    of these. And what came up was a number of pieces of data. So we look at these sorts of things theoretically  on the basis of genetics  and brain damage  and interaction with environment  and exactly how that machine works. So we're interested in exactly where in the brain  and what's the most important part of the brain. So we've been looking at this  the interaction of genes  what's called epigenetic effects  brain damage  and environment  and how these are tied together. And how you end up with a psychopath  and a killer  depends on exactly when the damage occurs. It's really a very precisely timed thing. You get different kinds of psychopaths. So we're going along with this. And here's  just to give you the pattern. The pattern is that those people  every one of them I looked at  who was a murderer  and was a serial killer  had damage to their orbital cortex  which is right above the eyes  the orbits  and also the interior part of the temporal lobe. So there is the pattern that every one of them had  but they all were a little different too. They had other sorts of brain damage. A key thing is that the major violence genes  it's called the MAO A gene. And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population. Some of you have this. And it's sex linked. It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way you can only get it from your mother. And in fact this is probably why mostly men  boys  are psychopathic killers  or are very aggressive. Because a daughter can get one X from the father  one X from the mother  it's kind of diluted out. But for a son  he can only get the X chromosome from his mother. So this is how it's passed from mother to son. And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development  which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed. But if you have this gene  in utero your brain is bathed in this  so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin  so it doesn't work later on in life. And I'd given this one talk in Israel  just this past year. And it does have some consequences. Theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene  in a violent way  very early on  before puberty  you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic    not a little stress  not being spanked or something  but really seeing violence  or being involved in it  in  D. Right  That's how the mirror neuron system works. And so  if you have that gene  and you see a lot of violence in a certain situation  this is the recipe for disaster  absolute disaster. And what I think might happen in these areas of the world  where we have constant violence  you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence. And if I was a young girl  somewhere in a violent area  you know  a    year old  and I want to find a mate  I'd find some tough guy  right  to protect me. Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes. And now the boys and the girls get them. So I think after several generations  and here is the idea  we really have a tinderbox. So that was the idea. But then my mother said to me   I hear you've been going around talking about psychopathic killers. And you're talking as if you come from a normal family.  I said   What the hell are you talking about   She then told me about our own family tree. Now she blamed this on my father's side  of course. This was one of these cases  because she has no violence in her background  but my father did. Well she said   There is good news and bad news. One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell  founder of Cornell university. But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden. Now I said   Okay  so what  We have Lizzie.  She goes   No it gets worse  read this book.  And here is this  Killed Strangely   and it's this historical book. And the first murder of a mother by a son was my great great great great great great grandfather. Okay  so that's the first case of matricide. And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials  and how people thought back then. But it doesn't stop there. There were seven more men  on my father's side  starting then  Cornells  that were all murderers. Okay  now this gives one a little pause. Because my father himself  and my three uncles  in World War II  were all conscientious objectors  all pussycats. But every once in a while  like Lizzie Borden  like three times a century  and we're kind of due. So the moral of the story is  people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. But more likely is this. And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it. And they all seemed to be OK. But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here. So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans of everybody in the family. We started to do PET scans  EEGs and genetic analysis to see where the bad news is. Now the only person    it turns out one son and one daughter  siblings  didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same. They have the same brain  and the same EEG. And now they are close as can be. But there's gonna be bad news somewhere. And we don't know where it's going to pop up. So that's my talk. Interestingly  Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man  in a moderately to darkly pigmented world. Over the course of his life  Darwin had great privilege. He lived in a fairly wealthy home. He was raised by very supportive and interested parents. And when he was in his   s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage  on the ship the Beagle. And during the course of that voyage  he saw remarkable things  tremendous diversity of plants and animals  and humans. And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book   On the Origin of Species   published     years ago. Now what is so interesting and to some  the extent  what's a bit infamous about  The Origin of Species   is that there is only one line in it about human evolution.  Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.  It wasn't until much longer  much later  that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans. Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle  and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists  he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied. And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color. He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator  lightly pigmented peoples  like himself  were found closer to the poles. So what did he make of all this  Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species. But much later  in       he did have something to say about it. And it was quite curious. He said   Of all the differences between the races of men  the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked.  And he went on to say   These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate.  So he had traveled all around. He had seen people of different colors living in different places. And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate. If only Darwin lived today. If only Darwin had NASA. Now  one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment. And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface. The TOMS   satellite data  shown here  show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface. Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year. The incrementally cooler colors    blues  greens  yellows  and finally grays    indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation. What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones. This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation. And what Darwin could not appreciate  or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time  is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation. And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution. And so when we look at a map of skin color  and predicted skin color  as we know it today  what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator  and the lightest ones toward the poles. What's very  very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high UV environments  in equatorial Africa. The earliest members of our lineage  the genus Homo  were darkly pigmented. And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented  two million to one and half million years ago. Now what happened in our history  Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface. In those early days of our evolution  looking at the equator  we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation. The UVC  the most energetic type  was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere. But UVB and UVA especially  came in unimpeded. UVB turns out to be incredibly important. It's very destructive  but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin  vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones  the health of our immune system  and myriad other important functions in our bodies. So  living at the equator  we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin    this wonderful  complex  ancient polymer compound in our skin    served as a superb natural sunscreen. This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms. Melanin  in various forms  has probably been on the Earth a billion years  and has been recruited over and over again by evolution  as often happens. Why change it if it works  So melanin was recruited  in our lineage  and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa  to be a natural sunscreen. Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation  the destruction  or damage to DNA  and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate  which helps to fuel cell production  and reproduction in the body. So  it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective  wonderful covering of melanin. But then we moved. And humans dispersed    not once  but twice. Major moves  outside of our equatorial homeland  from Africa into other parts of the Old World  and most recently  into the New World. When humans dispersed into these latitudes  what did they face  Conditions were significantly colder  but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime. So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere  look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation. We're still getting a dose of UVA. But all of the UVB  or nearly all of it  is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere. In the winter  when you are skiing in the Alps  you may experience ultraviolet radiation. But it's all UVA  and  significantly  that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin. So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year. This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation. Because what happened  in order to ensure health and well being  these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation. There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin. Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity. Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once  not just twice  but probably three times. Not just in modern humans  but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors  the Neanderthals. A remarkable  remarkable testament to the power of evolution. Humans have been on the move for a long time. And just in the last       years  in increasing rates  over increasing distances. Here are just some of the biggest movements of people  voluntary movements  in the last       years. Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions  people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa. And not all these moves were voluntary. Between      and          million      people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade. Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences. But it also had deleterious health consequences to people. So what  We've been on the move. We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments. Well  often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted. Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high UV areas. Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low UV areas. These have tremendous consequences for our health. We have to  if we're lightly pigmented  be careful about the problems of skin cancer  and destruction of folate in our bodies  by lots of sun. Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin. What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas  or working inside all the time. Because the problem there is just as severe  but it is more sinister  because vitamin D deficiency  from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation  is a major problem. Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people  and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones  to their gradual decay of their immune systems  or loss of immune function  and probably some problems with their mood and health  their mental health. So we have  in skin pigmentation  one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today. And the social consequences  as we know  are incredibly profound. We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another  but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions. So how can we overcome this  How can we begin to understand it  Evolution helps us.     years after Darwin's birthday  we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States. How wonderful is that  This man is significant for a whole host of reasons. But we need to think about how he compares  in terms of his pigmentation  to other people on Earth. He  as one of many urban admixed populations  is very emblematic of a mixed parentage  of a mixed pigmentation. And he resembles  very closely  people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa  or Southeast Asia. These people have a tremendous potential to tan  to develop more pigment in their skin  as a result of exposure to sun. They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency  if they have desk jobs  like that guy. So lets all wish for his great health  and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation. Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation  and the phenomenon of pigmentation  is that it is the demonstration  the evidence  of evolution by natural selection  right on your body. When people ask you   What is the evidence for evolution   You don't have to think about some exotic examples  or fossils. You just have to look at your skin. Darwin  I think  would have appreciated this  even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life. I think  were he able to look at the evidence we have today  he would understand it. He would appreciate it. And most of all  he would teach it. You  you can teach it. You can touch it. You can understand it. Take it out of this room. Take your skin color  and celebrate it. Spread the word. You have the evolution of the history of our species  part of it  written in your skin. Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it. Go out. Isn't it beautiful  Isn't it wonderful  You are the products of evolution. Thank you. Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall   Laughter  This is Kim  a nine year old Vietnam girl  her back ruined by napalm  and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War. This is Birhan  who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the     s     minutes away from death when she was rescued  and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world. This is Tiananmen Square. A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance. This next is the Sudanese girl  a few moments from death  a vulture hovering in the background  a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty. This is Neda  the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago  and she is now the focus  rightly so  of the YouTube generation. And what do all these pictures and events have in common  What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see. What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community. What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others  however distantly. What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves. What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions  across all faiths  across all continents    a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others  and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted  see injuries that need to be corrected  see problems that need to be rectified. There is a story about Olof Palme  the Swedish Prime Minister  going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the     s. Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said    and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister     Isn t this man a communist   The reply was   No  Mr President  he s an anti communist.  And Ronald Reagan said   I don t care what kind of communist he is   Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme  the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden   Well  what do you believe in  Do you want to abolish the rich   He said   No  I want to abolish the poor.  Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full. I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith  and people of no faith. But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world. We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet  but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication  that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with  and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history  and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society. Go back     years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters. They protested across Britain. They won public opinion over a long period of time. But it took    years for the campaign to be successful. What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people s hearts and minds  Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb  the woman who created Save the Children    years ago. She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria  that in Britain she wanted to take action  but she had to go house to house  leaflet to leaflet  to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children  an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world. But what more could she have done if she d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately  Now look at what s happened in the last    years. In Philippines in       President Estrada    a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime  eventually brought it down and it was  of course  called the  coup de text.   Laughter  Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago. Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations  it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do. Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out  a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening  until these blogs told the world that there was a repression  meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi  who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world  had to be listened to. Then take Iran itself  and what people are doing today  following what happened to Neda  people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran  any by everybody who is blogging  changing their address to Tehran  Iran  and making it difficult for the security services. Take  therefore  what modern technology is capable of  the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally. That  in my view  gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world. Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites  it s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging  who are communicating with each other around the world.     years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.     years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people  children  had the right to education.     years ago in most countries in Europe  the pressure was for the right to vote.    years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare. In the last       years we have seen fascism  anti Semitism  racism  apartheid  discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality  all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago  when he was in London. I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation. I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela    I was very privileged to do so    when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage.  Laughter  And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was. Amy Winehouse said   Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common. My husband too has spent a long time in prison.  Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all. He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain  the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid. He said that there was a greater challenge ahead  the challenge of poverty  of climate change    global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society. We are the first generation which is in a position to do this. Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally  with the challenges that we now face  most of which are global in their nature. Climate change cannot be solved in one country  but has got to be solved by the world working together. A financial crisis  just as we have seen  could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone  it needed the world to work together. Take the problems of security and terrorism and  equally  the problem of human rights and development  they cannot be solved by Africa alone  they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone. We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. So the great project of our generation  it seems to me  is to build for the first time  out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together  a truly global society  built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future. We have now  and are the first generation with  the power to do this. Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem  where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that  when we want to create a global carbon market  but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem  One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate change agenda. One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well  so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations. Take the financial crisis. If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub prime market of the United States of America. If people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many  many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain  and people's ordinary savings are affected by it  then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision. You need in the long run for stability  for economic growth  for jobs  as well as for financial stability  global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared  and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility  not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years. Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world  the poorest part of the world. We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future  and yet  out of people s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done. I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone. This is a country of six and a half million people  but it has only    doctors  it has     nurses  it has     midwives. You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources. Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania  a girl called Miriam. She was    years old  her parents had both died from AIDS  her mother and then her father. She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for. She herself was suffering from HIV  she was suffering from tuberculosis. I met her in a field  she was ragged  she had no shoes. When you looked in her eyes  any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future  but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment  I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture  so that Africa is not a net importer of food  but an exporter of food. Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world. Burma is in chains  Zimbabwe is a human tragedy  in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent. In the Rwanda Children's Museum  there is a photograph of a    year old boy and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died. There is a photograph of a boy called David. Beside that photograph there is the information about his life. It said  David  age   .  David  ambition to be a doctor. Favorite sport  football. What did he enjoy most  Making people laugh. How did he die  Tortured to death. Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death   Don't worry. The United Nations are coming.  And we never did. And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda  and we never did. So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid  but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world. So my argument today is basically this. We have the means by which we could create a truly global society. The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors. That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work  but we should not lose the chance in this generation  in this decade in particular  with President Obama in America  with other people working with us around the world  to create global institutions for the environment  and for finance  and for security and for development  that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples  our desire to bind the world together  and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist. It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences  people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero   Great speech.  But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences  people turned to each other and didn t say  Great speech.  They said   Let's march.  We should be marching towards a global society. Thank you. For me they normally happen  these career crises  often  actually  on a Sunday evening  just as the sun is starting to set  and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow. I'm mentioning all this    I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem  you may think I'm wrong in this  but I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises  by moments when what we thought we knew    about our lives  about our careers    comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality. It's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living. It's perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm  to be free of career anxiety. I want to look now  if I may  at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers. Why we might be victims of these career crises  as we're weeping softly into our pillows. One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs. In a way  I've got some bad news  particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad. There's a real problem with snobbery  because sometimes people from outside the U.K. imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon  fixated on country houses and titles. The bad news is that's not true. Snobbery is a global phenomenon  we are a global organization  this is a global phenomenon. What is a snob  A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you  and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are. That is snobbery. The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery. You encounter it within minutes at a party  when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early   st century   What do you do   According to how you answer that question  people are either incredibly delighted to see you  or look at their watch and make their excuses. Now  the opposite of a snob is your mother. Not necessarily your mother  or indeed mine  but  as it were  the ideal mother  somebody who doesn't care about your achievements. Unfortunately  most people are not our mothers. Most people make a strict correlation between how much time  and if you like  love    not romantic love  though that may be something    but love in general  respect    they are willing to accord us  that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy. And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods. You know  we're often told that we live in very materialistic times  that we're all greedy people. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want  it's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari  don't think   This is somebody who's greedy.  Think   This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love.  Feel sympathy  rather than contempt. There are other reasons    There are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before. One of these  and it's paradoxical  because it's linked to something that's rather nice  is the hope we all have for our careers. Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan. We're told  from many sources  that anyone can achieve anything. We've done away with the caste system  we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please. And it's a beautiful idea. Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality  we're all basically equal. There are no strictly defined hierarchies. There is one really big problem with this  and that problem is envy. Envy  it's a real taboo to mention envy  but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society  that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality. Let me explain. I think it would be very unusual for anyone here  or anyone watching  to be envious of the Queen of England. Even though she is much richer than any of you are  and she's got a very large house  the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird. She's simply too strange. We can't relate to her  she speaks in a funny way  she comes from an odd place. So we can't relate to her  and when you can't relate to somebody  you don't envy them. The closer two people are    in age  in background  in the process of identification    the more there's a danger of envy  which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion  because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with. The problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school. Everybody's wearing jeans  everybody's the same. And yet  they're not. So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality  which can make for a very stressful situation. It's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates  as it was unlikely in the   th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy. But the point is  it doesn't feel that way. It's made to feel  by magazines and other media outlets  that if you've got energy  a few bright ideas about technology  a garage    you  too  could start a major thing. The consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops. When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections  as I sometimes do    if you analyze self help books produced in the world today  there are basically two kinds. The first kind tells you   You can do it  You can make it  Anything's possible   The other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call  low self esteem   or impolitely call   feeling very bad about yourself.  There's a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything  and the existence of low self esteem. So that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback. There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious    about our careers  about our status in the world today  than ever before. And it's  again  linked to something nice. And that nice thing is called meritocracy. Everybody  all politicians on Left and Right  agree that meritocracy is a great thing  and we should all be trying to make our societies really  really meritocratic. In other words    what is a meritocratic society  A meritocratic society is one in which  if you've got talent and energy and skill  you will get to the top  nothing should hold you back. It's a beautiful idea. The problem is  if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top  get to the top  you'll also  by implication  and in a far more nasty way  believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there. In other words  your position in life comes to seem not accidental  but merited and deserved. And that makes failure seem much more crushing. You know  in the Middle Ages  in England  when you met a very poor person  that person would be described as an  unfortunate     literally  somebody who had not been blessed by fortune  an unfortunate. Nowadays  particularly in the United States  if you meet someone at the bottom of society  they may unkindly be described as a  loser.  There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser  and that shows     years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives. It's no longer the gods  it's us. We're in the driving seat. That's exhilarating if you're doing well  and very crushing if you're not. It leads  in the worst cases    in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim    it leads to increased rates of suicide. There are more suicides in developed  individualistic countries than in any other part of the world. And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally    they own their success  but they also own their failure. Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've been outlining  I think there is. I just want to turn to a few of them. Let's take meritocracy. This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to  I think it's a crazy idea  completely crazy. I will support any politician of Left and Right  with any halfway decent meritocratic idea  I am a meritocrat in that sense. But I think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic  it's an impossible dream. The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded  the good at the top  bad at the bottom  exactly done as it should be  is impossible. There are simply too many random factors  accidents  accidents of birth  accidents of things dropping on people's heads  illnesses  etc. We will never get to grade them  never get to grade people as they should. I'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in  The City of God   where he says   It's a sin to judge any man by his post.  In modern English that would mean it's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to  dependent on their business card. It's not the post that should count. According to St. Augustine  only God can really put everybody in their place  he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment  with angels and trumpets  and the skies will open. Insane idea  if you're a secularist person  like me. But something very valuable in that idea  nevertheless. In other words  hold your horses when you're coming to judge people. You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is. That is an unknown part of them  and we shouldn't behave as though it is known. There is another source of solace and comfort for all this. When we think about failing in life  when we think about failure  one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income  a loss of status. What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists. The number one organ of ridicule  nowadays  is the newspaper. If you open the newspaper any day of the week  it's full of people who've messed up their lives. They've slept with the wrong person  taken the wrong substance  passed the wrong piece of legislation    whatever it is  and then are fit for ridicule. In other words  they have failed. And they are described as  losers.  Now  is there any alternative to this  I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative  which is tragedy. Tragic art  as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece  in the fifth century B.C.  was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail  and also according them a level of sympathy  which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them. A few years ago  I was thinking about this  and I went to  The Sunday Sport   a tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already. And I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art. I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories  if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon. I mentioned Othello  they'd not heard of it but were fascinated. I asked them to write a headline for the story. They came up with  Love Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter.  Splashed across the headline. I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary. Again  a book they were enchanted to discover. And they wrote  Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud.  And then my favorite    they really do have a kind of genius of their own  these guys    my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King   Sex With Mum Was Blinding.  In a way  if you like  at one end of the spectrum of sympathy  you've got the tabloid newspaper. At the other end of the spectrum  you've got tragedy and tragic art. And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art. It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser. He is not a loser  though he has lost. And I think that is the message of tragedy to us  and why it's so very  very important  I think. The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety  is that we have nothing at its center that is non human. We are the first society to be living in a world where we don't worship anything other than ourselves. We think very highly of ourselves  and so we should  we've put people on the Moon  done all sorts of extraordinary things. And so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes. That's a very new situation. Most other societies have had  right at their center  the worship of something transcendent  a god  a spirit  a natural force  the universe  whatever it is    something else that is being worshiped. We've slightly lost the habit of doing that  which is  I think  why we're particularly drawn to nature. Not for the sake of our health  though it's often presented that way  but because it's an escape from the human anthill. It's an escape from our own competition  and our own dramas. And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans  and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters  etc. We like to feel in contact with something that is non human  and that is so deeply important to us. What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure. And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means. If I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful  certain ideas would immediately come to mind. You'd think that person might have made a lot of money  achieved renown in some field. My own theory of success    I'm somebody who's very interested in success  I really want to be successful  always thinking  how can I be more successful  But as I get older  I'm also very nuanced about what that word  success  might mean. Here's an insight that I've had about success  You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't. So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on  where the element of loss is. And I think any wise life will accept  as I say  that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding. And the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time  our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own. They're sucked in from other people  chiefly  if you're a man  your father  and if you're a woman  your mother. Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about    years. No one's quite listening hard enough  but I very much believe it's true. And we also suck in messages from everything from the television  to advertising  to marketing  etc. These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves. When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession  a lot of us want to go into banking. When banking is no longer so respectable  we lose interest in banking. We are highly open to suggestion. So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success  but we should make sure that they are our own. We should focus in on our ideas  and make sure that we own them  that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions. Because it's bad enough not getting what you want  but it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want  and find out  at the end of the journey  that it isn't  in fact  what you wanted all along. So  I'm going to end it there. But what I really want to stress is  by all means  success  yes. But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas. Let's probe away at our notions of success. Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That was fascinating. But how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a  loser   with the idea that a lot of people like  of seizing control of your life  and that a society that encourages that  perhaps has to have some winners and losers  Alain De Botton  Yes  I think it's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I want to stress  because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything  and politicians always talk about justice. Now I'm a firm believer in justice  I just think that it's impossible. So we should do everything we can to pursue it  but we should always remember that whoever is facing us  whatever has happened in their lives  there will be a strong element of the haphazard. That's what I'm trying to leave room for  otherwise  it can get quite claustrophobic. CA  I mean  do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder  gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy  Or do you think that you can't  but it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that  AB  The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them  and that somehow the crueler the environment  the more people will rise to the challenge. You want to think  who would you like as your ideal dad  And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle. And it's a very hard line to make. We need fathers  as it were  the exemplary father figures in society  avoiding the two extremes  which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand  and on the other  the lax  no rules option. CA  Alain De Botton. AB  Thank you very much. Hello  My name is Golan Levin. I'm an artist and an engineer  which is  increasingly  a more common kind of hybrid. But I still fall into this weird crack where people don't seem to understand me. And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture. It's a letter from  Artforum  in      saying  We can't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art.  And they still haven't. And lest you think that you all  as the digerati  are more enlightened  I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day. Where's art  I got productivity. I got sports. And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone  which my friends and I are doing now  is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for. So  from both directions  there is kind of  I think  a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day  or her own day  which I think artists are obliged to do  is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have. In my own case  I'm an artist  and I'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action  and basically empowering people through interactivity. I want people to discover themselves as actors  as creative actors  by having interactive experiences. A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this. This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine. And when I say desktop  I don't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk. If you look carefully  you can even see a hint of the Apple menu  up here in the upper left  where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical. So this is  as Joy Mountford once said   The mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through.  And the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences. How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences  not necessarily utilitarian ones. So I write software. And that's how I do it. And a lot of my experiences resemble mirrors in some way. Because this is  in some sense  the first way  that people discover their own potential as actors  and discover their own agency. By saying  Who is that person in the mirror  Oh it's actually me.  And so  to give an example  this is a project from last year  which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor. And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they're just going about their everyday business. So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth  or with each other  these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air    basically taking what's often this  kind of  unseen space  or this undetected space  and making it something real  that people then can appreciate and become creative with. So again  people discover their creative agency in this way. And their own personalities come out in totally unique ways. So in addition to using full body input  something that I've explored now  for a while  has been the use of the voice  which is an immensely expressive system for us  vocalizing. Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood. And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang K hler  the so called father of gestalt psychology  from       who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes. And he said one of them is called Maluma. And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which  Anyone want to hazard a guess  Maluma is on top. Yeah. So. As he says here  most people answer without any hesitation. So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia  which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have. And so  whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia  where they hear colors or taste shapes  and things like this  phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent. It's about mappings between different perceptual domains  like hardness  sharpness  brightness and darkness  and the phonemes that we're able to speak with. So    years on  there's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out the extent to which  you know  L  M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this  and P  T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this. And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically  a relative mapping between curvature and shape. So it occurred to me  what happens if we could run these backwards  And thus was born the project called Remark  which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman and the Ars Electronica Futurelab. And this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows. So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light. And as you do  you see the shadows of your own speech. And they sort of fly away  out of your head. If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you're saying  then it spells it out. And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made. So let's bring up a video of that. Thanks. So. And this project here  I was working with the great abstract vocalist  Jaap Blonk. And he is a world expert in performing  The Ursonate   which is a half an hour nonsense poem by Kurt Schwitters  written in the     s  which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense. And it's almost impossible to perform. But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it. And in this project we've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles. So these are our live subtitles  that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of  The Ursonate     fortunately Jaap does too  very well    and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is. So all the text you're going to see is real time generated by the computer  visualizing what he's doing with his voice. Here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him. Okay. So ... The full videos are online if you are interested. I got a split reaction to that during the live performance  because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron  because usually there is someone making them afterwards. And then a bunch of people who were like   What's the big deal  I see subtitles all the time on television.  You know  They don't imagine the person in the booth  typing it all. So in addition to the full body  and in addition to the voice  another thing that I've been really interested in  most recently  is the use of the eyes  or the gaze  in terms of how people relate to each other. It's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that's communicated with the eyes. And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences  being able to have a camera that can understand  from a fairly big distance away  how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in  and where your attention is directed. So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there. And so I've been beginning  with a variety of different projects  to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes. And basically to ask the questions  What if art was aware that we were looking at it  How could it respond  in a way  to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it  And what could it do if it could look back at us  And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects. In the first one which I'm going to show you  called Eyecode  it's a piece of interactive software in which  if we read this little circle   the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer.  The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed by different people in an installation. So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo. So let's run this and see if it works. Okay. Ah  there is lots of nice bright video. There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working. And what I'm just going to do is    I'm going to hide that. And you can see here that what it's doing is it's recording my eyes every time I blink. Hello  And I can ... hello ... okay. And no matter where I am  what's really going on here is that it's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes. And if I get really far away I'm blurry. You know  you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way. But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes. You can think of it as a way of  sort of  typing  with your eyes. And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes. So each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them. And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at  as you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them. So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink. And you can see  just once again  how it's sort of finding my eyes and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking. Alright. Let's leave that. So that's this kind of recursive observation system. Thank you. The last couple pieces I'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics    for me  new for me. It's called Opto Isolator. And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it  which is just a minute long. Okay. In this case  the Opto Isolator is blinking in response to one's own blinks. So it blinks one second after you do. This is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials. Just one eye  looking at you  and eliminating everything else about a face  but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of  as an element. And at the same time  it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho social gaze behaviors. Like looking away if you look at it too long because it gets shy  or things like that. Okay. So the last project I'm going to show is this new one called Snout. It's an eight foot snout  with a googly eye. And inside it's got an     pound robot arm that I borrowed  from a friend. It helps to have good friends. I'm at Carnegie Mellon  we've got a great Robotics Institute there. I'd like to show you thing called Snout  which is    The idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you. The idea is that basically    if it's constantly like  Huh  ... Huh   That's why its other name is Doubletaker  Taker of Doubles. It's always kind of doing a double take   What   And the idea is basically  can it look at you and make you feel as if like   What  Is it my shoes    Got something on my hair   Here we go. Alright. Checking him out ... For you nerds  here's a little behind the scenes. It's got a computer vision system  and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most. Those are its targets. Up there is the skeleton  which is actually what it's trying to do. It's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature. Hollywood does this all the time  of course. But also have the body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it. This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you  and it's interested in looking at you. Thank you very much. That's all I've got for today. And I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much. Well  this is     . And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin. And all over the world  eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this. And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life  and how he changed our thinking. I say almost every aspect  because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on. And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else. So I'm going to talk about it. It's the question of  why are we so different from the chimpanzees  We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related    hardly any genes of difference  very  very closely related. And yet  when you look at the phenotypes  there's a chimp  there's a man  they're astoundingly different  no resemblance at all. I'm not talking about airy fairy stuff about culture or psychology  or behavior. I'm talking about ground base  nitty gritty  measurable physical differences. They  that one  is hairy and walking on four legs. That one is a naked biped. Why  I mean    if I'm a good Darwinist  I've got to believe there's a reason for that. If we changed so much  something must have happened. What happened  Now    years ago  that was a laughably simple question. Everybody knew the answer. They knew what happened. The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees  our ancestors went out onto the plain. That explained everything. We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass  or to chase after animals  or to free our hands for weapons. And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away. Everybody knew that  for generations. But then  in the '  s  something began to unravel. The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids. And they weren't savanna species. And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores. And then they were so clever  they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen. Shock  horror. The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation. Some of it even came from lianas  those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle. So we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees  before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence. This is not something I've made up. It's not a minority theory. Everybody agrees with it. Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London. He said   Everything I've been telling you for the last    years  forget about it. It was wrong. We've got to go back to square one and start again.  It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one. I mean  it's a terrible thing to happen. You've got this beautiful paradigm. You've believed it through generations. Nobody has questioned it. You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it  relying on it to be as solid as a rock. And now it's whipped away from under you. What do you do  What does a scientist do in that case  Well  we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in     . He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is  guess what    they carry on as if nothing had happened. If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question. So they say   Yes it's wrong  but supposing it was right ...  And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions. So that is what they have done now. That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. Some of them have even elevated it into a principle. It's what we ought to be doing. Aaron Filler from Harvard said   Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures  I mean  why don't we talk about  well  there's chromosomes  and there's genes. And we just record what we see.  Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave  He knew all about that kind of science. And he called it hypothesis free science. And he despised it from the bottom of his heart. And if you're going to say   I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures   you can take  The Origin of Species  and throw it out of the window  for it's about nothing else but selective pressures. And the irony of it is  that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up. There was one waiting in the wings. It had been waiting there since      when Alister Hardy  a marine biologist  said   I think what happened  perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time.  He kept it to himself for    years. But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose. All his colleagues said   This is outrageous. You've exposed us to public ridicule  You must never do that again.  And at that time  it became set in stone  the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis  as part of the lunatic fringe of science. Well I don't think that. I think that Hardy had a lot going for him. I'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind  the things that made us different from everybody else  and all our relatives. Let's look at our naked skin. It's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair  mammals without body hair  are aquatic ones  like the dugong  the walrus  the dolphin  the hippopotamus  the manatee. And a couple of wallowers in mud like the babirusa. And you're tempted to think  well perhaps  could that be why we are naked  I suggested it and people said   No no no. I mean  look at the elephant. You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you   So back in      I said   Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.  Peals of merry laughter   That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she   But by now  everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor. This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors. The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros. Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said   Seems to have spent most of its time in the water.  So this is a close connection between nakedness and water. As an absolute connection  it only works one way. You can't say all aquatic animals are naked  because look at the sea otter. But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water  in its own lifetime  or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant. The only exception is the naked Somalian mole rat  which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground. And take bipedality. Here you can't find anybody to compare it with  because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs. But you can say this  all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs  if they want to  for a short time. There is only one circumstance in which they always  all of them  walk on two legs  and that is when they are wading through water. Do you think that's significant  David Attenborough thinks it's significant  as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. Look at the fat layer. We have got  under our skin  a layer of fat  all over  nothing in the least like that in any other primate. Why should it be there  Well they do know  that if you look at other aquatic mammals  the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall  around the kidneys and the intestines and so on  has started to migrate to the outside  and spread out in a layer inside the skin. In the whale it's complete  no fat inside at all  all in blubber outside. We cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen. We have got skin lined with this layer. It's the only possible explanation of why humans  if they're very unlucky  can become grossly obese  in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate  physically impossible. Something very odd  matter of factly  never explained. The question of why we can speak. We can speak. And the gorilla can't speak. Why  Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that    purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath. You can't even train a gorilla to say  Ah  on request. The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds. It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak. And then again  there is the fact that we are streamlined. Trying to imagine a diver diving into water    hardly makes a splash. Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver  and you can see that  compared with gorilla  we are halfway to being shaped like a fish. I am trying to suggest that  for    odd years  this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe  and it is not lunatic fringe. And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own  which they've all agreed on  and they love. There is nothing there. They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum. How do they react when I say these things  One very common reaction I've heard about    times is   But it was investigated. They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning  when Hardy put forward his article.  I don't believe it. For    years I've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind  and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths. It's never been done. I ask people sometimes  and they say   I like the aquatic theory  Everybody likes the aquatic theory. Of course they don't believe it  but they like it.  Well I say   Why do you think it's rubbish   They say  Well ... everybody I talk to says it's rubbish. And they can't all be wrong  can they   The answer to that  loud and clear  is   Yes  They can all be wrong.  History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong. And if you've got a scientific problem like that  you can't solve it by holding a head count  and saying   More of us say yes than say no.  Apart from that  some of the heads count more than others. Some of them have come over. There was Professor Tobias. He's come over. Daniel Dennett  he's come over. Sir David Attenborough  he's come over. Anybody else out there  Come on in. The water is lovely. And now we've got to look to the future. Ultimately one of three things is going to happen. Either they will go on for the next    years     years     years.  Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting.  That would be very sad. The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive  and say   I've found it. It was not the savanna  it was not the water  it was this   No sign of that happening either. I don't think there is a third option. So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing. If you look back at the early years of the last century  there was a stand off  a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel  and the believers in Darwin. It ended with a new synthesis  Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas blending together. And I think the same thing will happen here. You'll get a new synthesis. Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas will be blended together. And we can move forward from there  and really get somewhere. That would be a beautiful thing. It would be very nice for me if it happened soon. Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said   At my age  I don't even buy green bananas.  So if it's going to come and it's going to happen  what's holding it up  I can tell you that in three words. Academia says no. They decided in        That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis.  And it's not easy to change their minds. The professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole. The textbooks don't mention it. The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked  let alone look for a reason to it.  Horizon   which takes its cue from the academics  won't touch it with a barge pole. So we never hear the case put for it  except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe. I don't know quite where this diktat comes from. Somebody up there is issuing the commandment   Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory. And if you hope to make progress in this profession  and you do believe it  you'd better keep it to yourself  because it will get in your way.  So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood. But you know  that makes me feel good  because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood. He says   Firstly  you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive.  Right. I'll go ahead with that. And secondly  he says   You must never be afraid to rock the boat.  I'll go along with that too. Thank you very much.
