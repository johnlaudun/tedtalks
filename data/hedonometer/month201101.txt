My big idea is a very  very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us. And my little idea that will do that is sleep. This is a room of type A women. This is a room of sleep deprived women. And I learned the hard way  the value of sleep. Two and a half years ago  I fainted from exhaustion. I hit my head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone  I got five stitches on my right eye. And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. And in the course of that  I studied  I met with medical doctors  scientists  and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive  more inspired  more joyful life is getting enough sleep. And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution  this new feminist issue. We are literally going to sleep our way to the top  literally. Because unfortunately for men  sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before. And I felt like saying to him    but I didn't say it    I felt like saying   You know what  If you had gotten five  this dinner would have been a lot more interesting.  There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one upmanship. Especially here in Washington  if you try to make a breakfast date  and you say   How about eight o'clock   they're likely to tell you   Eight o'clock is too late for me  but that's okay  I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight.  And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive  but the truth is they're not  because we  at the moment  have had brilliant leaders in business  in finance  in politics  making terrible decisions. So a high I.Q. does not mean that you're a good leader  because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic. And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. In fact  I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters  they might still be around. While all the brothers were busy just being hyper connected       maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg  because she would have woken up from a seven and a half  or eight hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment  what is good for us on a personal level  what's going to bring more joy  gratitude  effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world. So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us  to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep. Thank you. You may have heard about the Koran's idea of paradise being    virgins  and I promise I will come back to those virgins. But in fact  here in the northwest  we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise  defined    times as  gardens watered by running streams.  Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union  this makes perfect sense to me. But the thing is  how come it's news to most people  I know many well intentioned non Muslims who've begun reading the Koran  but given up  disconcerted by its  otherness.  The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes  yet even he called the Koran  as toilsome reading as I ever undertook  a wearisome  confused jumble.  Part of the problem  I think  is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book    as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach  as though God    and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad    were just another author on the bestseller list. Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote    that is  to misquote. Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the  highlighter version   which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti Muslim Islamophobes. So this past spring  as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad  I realized I needed to read the Koran properly    as properly as I could  that is. My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary  so I took four well known translations and decided to read them side by side  verse by verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh century Arabic. Now I did have an advantage. My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a Sunni split  and for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories  so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers  its frame of reference. I knew enough  that is  to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran    an informed one  an experienced one even  but still an outsider  an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book. So I read slowly. I'd set aside three weeks for this project  and that  I think  is what is meant by  hubris        because it turned out to be three months. I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are. But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran    that feeling of  I get it now     it would slip away overnight  and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land  and yet the terrain was very familiar. The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels. So one third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham  Moses  Joseph  Mary  Jesus. God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh    jealously insisting on no other gods. The presence of camels  mountains  desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert. And then there was the language  the rhythmic cadence of it  reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours long narrative poems entirely from memory. And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic. Take the Fatihah  the seven verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined. It's just    words in Arabic  but anywhere from    to    in translation. And yet the more you add  the more seems to go missing. The Arabic has an incantatory  almost hypnotic  quality that begs to be heard rather than read  felt more than analyzed. It wants to be chanted out loud  to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue. So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself  or as Arthur Arberry called his version   an interpretation.  But all is not lost in translation. As the Koran promises  patience is rewarded  and there are many surprises    a degree of environmental awareness  for instance  and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation  unmatched in the Bible. And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men  using the second and third person masculine  the Koran includes women    talking  for instance  of believing men and believing women  honorable men and honorable women. Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers. Yes  it does say that  but in a very specific context  the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden  and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers. Not  You must kill unbelievers in Mecca   but you can  you are allowed to  but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba  and only if they attack you first. And even then    God is merciful  forgiveness is supreme    and so  essentially  better if you don't. This was perhaps the biggest surprise    how flexible the Koran is  at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible.  Some of these verses are definite in meaning   it says   and others are ambiguous.  The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities  trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own. Only God knows the true meaning. The phrase  God is subtle  appears again and again  and indeed  the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe. As in  for instance  that little matter of virgins and paradise. Old fashioned Orientalism comes into play here. The word used four times is Houris  rendered as dark eyed maidens with swelling breasts  or as fair  high bosomed virgins. Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word  Houris. Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight. Now this may be a way of saying  pure beings     like in angels    or it may be like the Greek Kouros or K r   an eternal youth. But the truth is nobody really knows  and that's the point. Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be  a new creation in paradise  and that you will be  recreated in a form unknown to you   which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin. And that number    never appears. There are no    virgins in the Koran. That idea only came into being     years later  and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps. Paradise is quite the opposite. It's not virginity  it's fecundity. It's plenty. It's gardens watered by running streams. Thank you. So I am a surgeon who studies creativity  and I have never had a patient tell me that  I really want you to be creative during surgery   and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it. I will say though that  after having done surgery a lot  it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument. And for me  this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound  particularly music. And so I'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative. I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University  but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously. I'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments. I'm going to start off by playing a video for you. And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett  who's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known  iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level. And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head  and he'll never play it exactly the same way again  and so  as a form of intense creativity  I think this is a great example. And so why don't we go and click the video. It's really a remarkable  awesome thing that happens there. I've always    just as a listener  as just a fan    I listen to that  and I'm just astounded. I think    how can this possibly be  How can the brain generate that much information  that much music  spontaneously  And so I set out with this concept  scientifically  that artistic creativity  it's magical  but it's not magic  meaning that it's a product of the brain. There's not too many brain dead people creating art. And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product  I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process. And I think there's some sub questions there that I put there. Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically  And I think that's a good question. And I'll tell you that most scientific studies of music  they're very dense  and when you actually go through them  it's very hard to recognize the music in it. In fact  they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music. And so it brings the second question  Why should scientists study creativity  Maybe we're not the right people to do it. Well it may be  but I will say that  from a scientific perspective    we talked a lot about innovation today    the science of innovation  how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy  and truly  we know very little about how we are able to be creative. And so I think that we're going to see over the next            years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish. Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this  complex jazz improvisation  and study it rigorously. And so it gets down to the brain. And so all of us have this remarkable brain  which is poorly understood to say the least. I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers  and I myself  I'm not going to give you many answers today  just ask a lot of questions. And fundamentally that's what I do in my lab. I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this. This is the main method that I use. This is called functional MRI. If you've been in an MRI scanner  it's very much the same  but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain  but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain. Now the way that's done is by the following. There's something called BOLD imaging  which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging. Now when you're in an fMRI scanner  you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas. When an area of the brain is active  meaning a neural area is active  it gets blood flow shunted to that area. That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI  whereas oxyhemoglobin can't. So through this method of inference    and we're measuring blood flow  not neural activity    we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task  and that's the crux of how fMRI works. And it's been used since the '  s to study really complex processes. Now I'm going to review a study that I did  which was jazz in an fMRI scanner. And this was done with a colleague of mine  Alan Braun  at the NIH. This is a short video of how we did this project. that we use for the jazz experiments. And it's a    key keyboard that is designed to fit both inside the scanner  be magnetically safe  have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner  playing on their back. And it works like this    this doesn't actually produce any sound. It sends out what's called a MIDI signal    or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface    through these wires into the box and then the computer  which then trigger high quality piano samples like this. CL  Okay  so it works. And so through this piano keyboard  we now have the means to take a musical process and study it. So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard  You can't just sort of     It's great we've got this keyboard.  We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment. And so the experiment really rests on the following  What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over learned  and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated  or improvised  in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features  And so  I have here what we call the  paradigms.  There's a scale paradigm  which is just playing a scale up and down  memorized. And then there's improvising on a scale    quarter notes  metronome  right hand    scientifically very safe  but musically really boring. And then there's the bottom one  which is called the jazz paradigm. And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH  and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left  the lower left    which is what you heard me playing    and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes. And if you can hit that lower right sound icon  that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner. So in the end  it's not the most natural environment  but they're able to play real music. And I've listened to that solo     times  and I still like it. And the musicians  they were comfortable in the end. And so we first measured the number of notes. Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising  That was not what was going on. And then we looked at the brain activity. I'm going to try to condense this for you. These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized. In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex  the frontal lobe of the brain  and in blue is this area that was deactivated. And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity. We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity  and I'll summarize that for you here. Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain. As I like to say  these are not the  jazz areas  of the brain. They do a whole host of things that have to do with self reflection  introspection  working memory and so forth. Really  consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe. But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self monitoring  turning off  and this area that's thought to be autobiographical  or self expressive  turning on. And we think  at least in this preliminary    it's one study  it's probably wrong  but it's one study    we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that  to be creative  you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe. One area turns on  and a big area shuts off  so that you're not inhibited  so that you're willing to make mistakes  so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses. Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity    sometimes it's done communicatively. And so the next question was  What happens when musicians are trading back and forth  something called  trading fours   which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment  So this is a twelve bar blues. And I've broken it down into four bar groups here  so you would know how you would trade. Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner    same way    had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively. So this is a musician  Mike Pope  one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player. So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it. Nurse  Nothing's in your pockets  right Mike  MP  Nope. Nothing's in my pockets. Nurse  Okay. CL  You have to have the right attitude to agree to it. It's kind of fun actually. And so now we're playing back and forth. He's in there. You can see his legs up there. And then I'm in the control room here  playing back and forth. of what it's like. And it's good that it's not too quick. The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings. So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing  of looking at my hands through two mirrors  laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand. That was challenging. But again  there were moments  for sure  there were moments of real  honest to God musical interplay  for sure. CL  At this point  I'll take a few moments. And so what you're seeing here    and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science  which is to show you preliminary data. This is one subject's data. This is  in fact  Mike Pope's data. So what am I showing you here  When he was trading fours with me  improvising versus memorized  his language areas lit up  his Broca's area  which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left. He actually had it also homologous on the right. This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication. This whole notion that music is a language    well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all  and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation. And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now  and we're just getting all the data together  so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully. Now when I think about improvisation and the language  well what's next  Rap  of course  rap    free style. And so I've always been fascinated by free style. And let's go ahead and play this video here.   Rockin' it when I be  in your vicinity     Whole style synergy  recognize symmetry     Go and try to injure me  broke 'em down chemically     Ain't the number    MC  talk about how been I be     Styled it like Kennedy  late like a    to three     When I say when I be  girls say bend that key cut   CL  And so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free style rap and jazz. There are  in fact  a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods. In a lot a ways  rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve. So how do you study rap scientifically  And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy  but I think it's very viable. And so this is what you do  you have a free style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them  that they've never heard before  and then you have them free style. So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED  and they said   No  you won't.  And then I thought    But here's the thing. With this big screen  you can all rap with me. Okay  So what we had them do was memorize this lower left sound icon  please. This is the control condition. This is what they memorized. Computer    Memory  thump.   CL    Thump of the beat in a known repeat     Rhythm and rhyme  they make me complete     The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     My passion's not fashion  you can see how I'm dressed     Psychopathic words in my head appear     Whisper these lyrics only I can hear     The art of discovering and that which is hovering     Inside the mind of those unconfined     All of these words keep pouring out like rain     I need a mad scientist to check my brain   I guarantee you that will never happen again. So now  what's great about these free stylers  they will get cued different words. They don't know what's coming  but they'll hear something off the cuff. Go ahead and hit that right sound icon. They are going to be cued these three square words   like    not  and  head.  He doesn't know what's coming. Free styler    I'm like some kind of  unclear       unclear  extraterrestrial  celestial scene     Back in the days  I used to sit in pyramids and meditate     With two microphones hovering over my head     See if I could still listen  spittin' off the sound     See what you grinning     I teach the children in the back of the classroom     About the message of apocalyptical     Not really though  'cause I've got to keep it simple      unclear  instrumental     Detrimental playing Super Mario      unclear  boxes  unclear  hip hop   CL  So again  it's an incredible thing that's taking place. It's doing something that  neurologically  is remarkable. Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant. Creatively speaking  it's just a phenomenal thing. This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner. CL  That was recorded in the scanner  by the way. He's just memorized a rhyme for us. Emmanuel    Top of the beat with no repeat     Rhythm and rhyme make me complete     Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic     Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike     I search for the truth in this eternal quest     I'm passing on fashion  you can see how I'm dressed   CL  Okay. So I'm going to stop that there. So what do we see in his brain  Well  this is actually four rappers' brains. And what we see  we do see language areas lighting up  but then    eyes closed    when you are free styling versus memorizing  you've got major visual areas lighting up. You've got major cerebellar activity  which is involved in motor coordination. You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task  when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized. It's very preliminary  but I think it's kind of cool. So just to conclude  we've got a lot of questions to ask  and like I said  we'll ask questions here  not answer them. But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius  neurologically  and I think  with these methods  we're getting close to being there. And I think hopefully in the next        years you'll actually see real  meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art  and maybe we're starting now to get there. And so I want to thank you for your time. I appreciate it. There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography    women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn't work well at all. Do you know which group you're in  If you don't  you're not alone. Because the breast has become are very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press  politicians  radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first  my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I'm not a radiologist. I don't have any patents  and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company  and I am not seeking your vote. What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about    years ago when a patient asked me a question. She came to see me after discovering a breast lump. Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her   s. She and I were both very pregnant at that time  and my heart just ached for her  imagining how afraid she must be. Fortunately  her lump proved to be benign. But she asked me a question  how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one  So I studied her mammogram  and I reviewed the radiology literature  and I was shocked to discover that  in her case  our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin. You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their   s. Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force  even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar with the mammography studies. It took the Senate just    days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage. Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines. The pre eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post. The radiologists were  in turn  criticized for protecting their own financial self interest. But in my view  the radiologists are heroes. There's a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms  and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret  and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause. But that very fact is telling. Where there is this much legal smoke  there is likely to be some fire. The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat    pictured here in yellow    versus connective and epithelial tissues    pictured in pink. And that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two thirds of women in their   s have dense breast tissue  which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age  up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. So how do you know if your breasts are dense  Well  you need to read the details of your mammography report. Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram. If the breast is less than    percent dense  that's called fatty replaced. The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities  followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense. And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense. The problem with breast density is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing. Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram  and the X ray often can't distinguish between the two. So it's easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast. But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast. That's why mammograms find over    percent of tumors in fatty breasts  but as few as    percent in extremely dense breasts. Now it's bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer  but it turns out that it's also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer. It's a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer. At the time my patient posed this question to me  breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature  and very few women having mammograms  or the physicians ordering them  knew about this. But what else could I offer her  Mammograms have been around since the     's  and it's changed very little. There have been surprisingly few innovations  until digital mammography was approved in     . Digital mammography is still an X ray of the breast  but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally  just like we can with a digital camera. The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment  and what have we gained from that investment  In a study funded by over    million taxpayer dollars  digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography  and in fact  it was worse in older women. But it was better in one group  and that was women under    who were pre menopausal and had dense breasts  and in those women  digital mammography found twice as many cancers  but it still only found    percent. So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment  but it's been a very small step forward for womankind. What about ultrasound  Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies  so it's not widely used. And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors  but it's also very expensive. If we think about disruptive technology  we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive. Think about iPods compared to stereos. But it's the exact opposite in health care. The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive. Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer. It's just way too much equipment. One MRI scan costs    times what a digital mammogram costs. And sooner or later  we're going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can't always come at a much higher price. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation  and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual's genius. Rather  big ideas can be orchestrated  if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don't ordinarily talk about. It's like the essence of TED. He quotes one innovator who says   The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick.  This makes no sense  because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don't realize have solutions. And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don't realize are problems. Now  take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell's article  and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers. So if you will allow me a little creative license  I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient's problem with a physicist's solution. Shortly after her visit  I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner  who was a specialist in cardiac imaging  something I had nothing to do with. And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel  where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector. Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart  and it had even been tried to image the breast. But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge  bulky tubes  and they were filled with these scintillating crystals  and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors. But the potential advantage was that gamma rays  unlike X rays  are not influenced by breast density. But this technology could not find tumors when they're small  and finding a small tumor is critical for survival. If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter  survival exceeds    percent  but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases. But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen  and this is it. It's made not of a bulky tube  but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector. And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density  and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors. So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape       Michael hacked off the X ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out  and we attached the new detector  and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging  or MBI. This is an image from our first patient. And you can see  using the old gamma technology  that it just looked like noise. But using our new detector  we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. So here we were  a nuclear physicist  an internist  soon joined by Carrie Hruska  a biomedical engineer  and two radiologists  and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape. To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement  but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system. This is our current detector. And you can see that it looks a lot different. The duct tape is gone  and we added a second detector on top of the breast  which has further improved our tumor detection. So how does this work  The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells  but not by normal cells  and this is the key difference from mammography. Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue  and we've seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast. But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors  and therefore  it's impervious to breast density. After the injection  the patient's breast is placed between the detectors. And if you've ever had a mammogram    if you're old enough to have had a mammogram    you know what comes next  pain. You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that's regulated by federal law  and the law requires that the equivalent of a    pound car battery come down on your breast during this study. But with MBI  we use just light  pain free compression. And the detector then transmits the image to the computer. So here's an example. You can see  on the right  a mammogram showing a faint tumor  the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue. But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly  as well as a second tumor  which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options. In this example  although the mammogram found one tumor  we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors    one is small as three millimeters. Our big break came in     . After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors  we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study       women with dense breasts  comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI. Of the tumors that we found  mammography found only    percent of those tumors. MBI found    percent. Here's an example from that screening study. The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue  but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake  which correlated with a two centimeter tumor. In this case  a one centimeter tumor. And in this case  a    year old medical secretary at Mayo  who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young  wanted to enroll in our study. And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue  but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake  which we can also see on a color image. And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball. But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes. So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast  we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose  and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose  we're continuing this screening study  and this image from three weeks ago in a    year old woman shows a normal digital mammogram  but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it's benefiting. It's also older women with dense tissue. And we're now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology. MBI generates four images per breast. MRI generates over a thousand. It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding. But I suspect even the non radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image. But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive    it's as accurate as MRI  it's far less complex to interpret  and it's a fraction of the cost. But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo. After achieving what we felt were remarkable results  our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection  we requested reconsideration of the manuscript  because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology. We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose  and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions  and this could take five or more years. If this technology is widely adopted  I will not benefit financially in any way  and that is very important to me  because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth. But I recognize    I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science. The MBI unit has now been FDA approved  but it's not yet widely available. So until something is available for women with dense breasts  there are things that you should know to protect yourself. First  know your density. Ninety percent of women don't  and    percent of women don't know that it increases your breast cancer risk. The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram. I was at a conference of        people in breast imaging last week in Chicago  and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is. Of course we should. And if you don't know  please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report. Second  if you're pre menopausal  try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle  when breast density is relatively lower. Third  if you notice a persistent change in your breast  insist on additional imaging. And fourth and most important  the mammography debate will rage on  but I do believe that all women    and older should have an annual mammogram. Mammography isn't perfect  but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later  and most women  thankfully  survive. So it takes    or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim. It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations. We need to individualize screening based on density. For women without dense breasts  mammography is the best choice. But for women with dense breasts  we shouldn't abandon screening altogether  we need to offer them something better. The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school  and the answer has been so slow to come. She's given me her blessing to share this story with you. After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer  she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy. We can and must do better  not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters  but in time for you. Thank you. So the Awesome story  It begins about    years ago  when my mom and my dad came to Canada. My mom left Nairobi  Kenya. My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar  India. And they got here in the late     s. They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto  and they settled into a new life. They saw their first dentist  they ate their first hamburger  and they had their first kids. My sister and I grew up here  and we had quiet  happy childhoods. We had close family  good friends  a quiet street. We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up    things like power always on in our houses  things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard. We grew up  and we grew older. I went to high school. I graduated. I moved out of the house  I got a job  I found a girl  I settled down    and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song    but life was pretty good. Life was pretty good.      was a great year. Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario  I got married  surrounded by     family and friends.      was a great year. I graduated from school  and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends. Here's a picture of me and my friend  Chris  on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. We actually saw seals out of our car window  and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads. So you can't actually see them  but it was breathtaking  believe me.      and      were a little tougher. I know that they were tougher for a lot of people  not just me. First of all  the news was so heavy. It's still heavy now  and it was heavy before that  but when you flipped open a newspaper  when you turned on the TV  it was about ice caps melting  wars going on around the world  earthquakes  hurricanes and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse  and then eventually did collapse  and so many of us losing our homes  or our jobs  or our retirements  or our livelihoods.            were heavy years for me for another reason  too. I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time. My marriage wasn't going well  and we just were growing further and further apart. One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage  through a lot of tears  to have a very honest conversation. And she said   I don't love you anymore   and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard  until only a month later  when I heard something even more heartbreaking. My friend Chris  who I just showed you a picture of  had been battling mental illness for some time. And for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness  you know how challenging it can be. I spoke to him on the phone at       p.m. on a Sunday night. We talked about the TV show we watched that evening. And Monday morning  I found out that he disappeared. Very sadly  he took his own life. And it was a really heavy time. And as these dark clouds were circling me  and I was finding it really  really difficult to think of anything good  I said to myself that I really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow. So I came home from work one night  and I logged onto the computer  and I started up a tiny website called     awesomethings.com. I was trying to remind myself of the simple  universal  little pleasures that we all love  but we just don't talk about enough    things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking  being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding  wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer  or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line    even if you were last at the other line  swoop right in there. And slowly over time  I started putting myself in a better mood. I mean         blogs are started a day  and so my blog was just one of those       . And nobody read it except for my mom. Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by     percent when she forwarded it to my dad. And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits  and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions. It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And then I got a phone call  and the voice at the other end of the line said   You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.  I was like  that sounds totally fake. Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to  But it turns out  I jumped on a plane  and I ended up walking a red carpet between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart. And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog. And the surprise and just the amazement of that was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto  when  in my inbox     literary agents were waiting for me to talk about putting this into a book. Flash forward to the next year and  The Book of Awesome  has now been number one on the bestseller list for    straight weeks. But look  I said I wanted to do three things with you today. I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story  I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome  and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought. So let's talk about those three As. Over the last few years  I haven't had that much time to really think. But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself   What is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website  but also grow myself   And I've summarized those things  for me personally  as three As. They are Attitude  Awareness and Authenticity. I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. So Attitude  Look  we're all going to get lumps  and we're all going to get bumps. None of us can predict the future  but we do know one thing about it and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan. We will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages  father daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room  but between those high highs  we may also have some lumps and some bumps too. It's sad  and it's not pleasant to talk about  but your husband might leave you  your girlfriend could cheat  your headaches might be more serious than you thought  or your dog could get hit by a car on the street. It's not a happy thought  but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes. Your mom could get cancer  your dad could get mean. And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well  too  with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart  and when that bad news washes over you  and when that pain sponges and soaks in  I just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices. One  you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever  or two  you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes. Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two  and choosing  no matter how difficult it is  no matter what pain hits you  choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future. The second  A  is Awareness. I love hanging out with three year olds. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk. I love the way that they'll stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand  soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs. I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for Thanksgiving dinner. I love the way that they see the world  because they're seeing the world for the first time. Having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old. Because you all used to be three years old. That three year old boy is still part of you. That three year old girl is still part of you. They're in there. And being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you've seen for the first time once  too. So there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work. There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air  or the first time you pulled a    dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket and said   Found money.  The last  A  is Authenticity. And for this one  I want to tell you a quick story. Let's go all the way back to      when  on a peanut farm in Georgia  a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born. Roosevelt Grier  or Rosey Grier  as people used to call him  grew up and grew into a     pound  six foot five linebacker in the NFL. He's number    in the picture. Here he is pictured with the  fearsome foursome.  These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the     s you did not want to go up against. They were tough football players doing what they love  which was crushing skulls and separating shoulders on the football field. But Rosey Grier also had another passion. In his deeply authentic self  he also loved needlepoint.  Laughter  He loved knitting. He said that it calmed him down  it relaxed him  it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks. That's what he said. I mean  he loved it so much that  after he retired from the NFL  he started joining clubs. And he even put out a book called  Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.  It's a great cover. If you notice  he's actually needlepointing his own face. And so what I love about this story is that Rosey Grier is just such an authentic person  and that's what authenticity is all about. It's just about being you and being cool with that. And I think when you're authentic  you end up following your heart  and you put yourself in places and situations and in conversations that you love and that you enjoy. You meet people that you like talking to. You go places you've dreamt about. And you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled. So those are the three A's. For the closing thought  I want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to Canada. I don't know what it would feel like coming to a new country when you're in your mid   s. I don't know  because I never did it  but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude. I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you're starting to see in your new world. And I think you'd have to be really authentic  you'd have to be really true to yourself in order to get through what you're being exposed to. I'd like to pause my TEDTalk for about    seconds right now  because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this  and my parents are sitting in the front row. So I wanted to ask them to  if they don't mind  stand up. And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. When I was growing up  my dad used to love telling the story of his first day in Canada. And it's a great story  because what happened was he got off the plane at the Toronto airport  and he was welcomed by a non profit group  which I'm sure someone in this room runs. And this non profit group had a big welcoming lunch for all the new immigrants to Canada. And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch and there was this huge spread. There was bread  there was those little  mini dill pickles  there was olives  those little white onions. There was rolled up turkey cold cuts  rolled up ham cold cuts  rolled up roast beef cold cuts and little cubes of cheese. There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches. There was lasagna  there was casseroles  there was brownies  there was butter tarts  and there was pies  lots and lots of pies. And when my dad tells the story  he says   The craziest thing was  I'd never seen any of that before  except bread. I didn't know what was meat  what was vegetarian. I was eating olives with pie. I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here.  When I was five years old  my dad used to take me grocery shopping  and he would stare in wonder at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables. He would say   Look  can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico  They've got an apple here from South Africa. Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco   He's like   Do you know where Morocco even is   And I'd say   I'm five. I don't even know where I am. Is this A P   And he'd say   I don't know where Morocco is either  but let's find out.  And so we'd buy the date  and we'd go home. And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf  and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country. And when we did  my dad would say   Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there  picked this thing off it  put it in a truck  drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house  so they could sell it to us for    cents   And I'd say   I don't believe that.  And he's like   I don't believe it either. Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about.  When I stop to think about it  he's absolutely right. There are so many things to be happy about. We are the only species on the only life giving rock in the entire universe that we've ever seen  capable of experiencing so many of these things. I mean  we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture. We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy. We've got airplanes  highway lanes  interior design and horoscope signs. We've got fashion magazines  house party scenes. You can watch a horror movie with monsters. You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming. We've got books  buffets and radio waves  wedding brides and rollercoaster rides. You can sleep in clean sheets. You can go to the movies and get good seats. You can smell bakery air  walk around with rain hair  pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. We've got all that  but we've only got     years to enjoy it. And that's the sad part. The cashiers at your grocery store  the foreman at your plant  the guy tailgating you home on the highway  the telemarketer calling you during dinner  every teacher you've ever had  everyone that's ever woken up beside you  every politician in every country  every actor in every movie  every single person in your family  everyone you love  everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years. Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet. And that moment is right now  and those moments are counting down  and those moments are always  always  always fleeting. You will never be as young as you are right now. And that's why I believe that if you live your life with a great attitude  choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow  living with a sense of awareness of the world around you  embracing your inner three year old and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself  being you and being cool with that  letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you  then I think you'll live a life that is rich and is satisfying  and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. Thank you. I'm actually here to make a challenge to people. I know there have been many challenges made to people. The one I'm going to make is that it is time for us to reclaim what peace really means. Peace is not  Kumbaya  my Lord.  Peace is not the dove and the rainbow    as lovely as they are. When I see the symbols of the rainbow and the dove  I think of personal serenity. I think of meditation. I do not think about what I consider to be peace  which is sustainable peace with justice and equality. It is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives  where these people have enough access to education and health care  so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear. This is called human security. And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really  really heavy duty  non violent friends  like Mairead McGuire. I understand that humans are so  messed up     to use a nice word  because I promised my mom I'd stop using the F bomb in public. And I'm trying harder and harder. Mom  I'm really trying. We need a little bit of police  we need a little bit of military  but for defense. We need to redefine what makes us secure in this world. It is not arming our country to the teeth. It is not getting other countries to arm themselves to the teeth with the weapons that we produce and we sell them. It is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure  to make the people of the world secure. I was thinking about the recent ongoings in Congress  where the president is offering  .  billion dollars to try to get the START vote. I certainly support the START vote. But he's offering    billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons. Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is    billion dollars  Just that little bit of money  which to me  I wish it was in my bank account    it's not  but ... In global terms  it's a little bit of money. But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime  unless we get up off our ... and take action to make it happen  unless we begin to believe that all of the things that we've been hearing about in these last two days are elements of what come together to make human security. It is saving the tigers. It is stopping the tar sands. It is having access to medical equipment that can actually tell who does have cancer. It is all of those things. It is using our money for all of those things. It is about action. I was in Hiroshima a couple of weeks ago  and His Holiness    we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city  and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates. And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church. We're staring at everybody  waiting our turn to speak  and he leans over to me  and he says   Jody  I'm a Buddhist monk.  I said   Yes  Your Holiness. Your robe gives it away.  He said   You know that I kind of like meditation  and I pray.  I said   That's good. That's good. We need that in the world. I don't follow that  but that's cool.  And he says   But I have become skeptical. I do not believe that meditation and prayer will change this world. I think what we need is action.  His Holiness  in his robes  is my new action hero. I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi a couple of days ago. As most of you know  she's a hero for democracy in her country  Burma. You probably also know that she has spent    of the last    years imprisoned for her efforts to bring about democracy. She was just released a couple of weeks ago  and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free  because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon  agitating for change. She is already out in the streets  working with the party to try to rebuild it. But I talked to her for a range of issues. But one thing that I want to say  because it's similar to what His Holiness said. She said   You know  we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country. But I don't believe in hope without endeavor. I don't believe in the hope of change  unless we take action to make it so.  Here's another woman hero of mine. She's my friend  Dr. Shirin Ebadi  the first Muslim woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been in exile for the last year and a half. You ask her where she lives    where does she live in exile  She says the airports of the world. She is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the elections. And instead of going home  she conferred with all the other women that she works with  who said to her   Stay out. We need you out. We need to be able to talk to you out there  so that you can give the message of what's happening here.  A year and a half    she's out speaking on behalf of the other women in her country. Wangari Maathai         Peace laureate. They call her the  Tree Lady   but she's more than the Tree Lady. Working for peace is very creative. It's hard work every day. When she was planting those trees  I don't think most people understand that  at the same time  she was using the action of getting people together to plant those trees to talk about how to overcome the authoritarian government in her country. People could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail. But if they were together planting trees for the environment  it was okay    creativity. But it's not just iconic women like Shirin  like Aung Sun Suu Kyi  like Wangari Maathai    it is other women in the world who are also struggling together to change this world. The Women's League of Burma     individual organizations of Burmese women came together because there's strength in numbers. Working together is what changes our world. The Million Signatures Campaign of women inside Burma working together to change human rights  to bring democracy to that country. When one is arrested and taken to prison  another one comes out and joins the movement  recognizing that if they work together  they will ultimately bring change in their own country. Mairead McGuire in the middle  Betty Williams on the right hand side    bringing peace to Northern Ireland. I'll tell you the quick story. An IRA driver was shot  and his car plowed into people on the side of the street. There was a mother and three children. The children were killed on the spot. It was Mairead's sister. Instead of giving in to grief  depression  defeat in the face of that violence  Mairead hooked up with Betty    a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic    and they took to the streets to say   No more violence.  And they were able to get tens of thousands of  primarily  women  some men  in the streets to bring about change. And they have been part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland  and they're still working on it  because there's still a lot more to do. This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum. She also received the Peace Prize. She is now running for president. She is educating the indigenous people of her country about what it means to be a democracy  about how you bring democracy to the country  about educating  about how to vote    but that democracy is not just about voting  it's about being an active citizen. That's what I got stuck doing    the landmine campaign. One of the things that made this campaign work is because we grew from two NGOs to thousands in    countries around the world  working together in common cause to ban landmines. Some of the people who worked in our campaign could only work maybe an hour a month. They could maybe volunteer that much. There were others  like myself  who were full time. But it was the actions  together  of all of us that brought about that change. In my view  what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace. It's not a dirty word. It's hard work every single day. And if each of us who cares about the different things we care about got up off our butts and volunteered as much time as we could  we would change this world  we would save this world. And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves. Thank you. I would like to tell you all that you are all actually cyborgs  but not the cyborgs that you think. You're not RoboCop  and you're not Terminator  but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices. So what's a good definition for cyborg  Well  traditional definition is  an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments.  That came from a      paper on space travel  because  if you think about it  space is pretty awkward. People aren't supposed to be there. But humans are curious  and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next. So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology. Somebody goes to another country  says   How fascinating these people are  how interesting their tools are  how curious their culture is.  And then they write a paper  and maybe a few other anthropologists read it  and we think it's very exotic. Well  what's happening is that we've suddenly found a new species. I  as a cyborg anthropologist  have suddenly said   Oh  wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens  and look at these fascinating cultures  and look at these curious rituals that everybody's doing around this technology. They're clicking on things and staring at screens.  Now there's a reason why I study this  versus traditional anthropology. And the reason is that tool use  in the beginning    for thousands and thousands of years  everything has been a physical modification of self. It has helped us to extend our physical selves  go faster  hit things harder  and there's been a limit on that. But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self  but an extension of the mental self  and because of that  we're able to travel faster  communicate differently. And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology. We can put anything we want into it  and it doesn't get heavier  and then we can take anything out. What does the inside of your computer actually look like  Well  if you print it out  it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time. And if you actually lose that information  it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind  that you suddenly feel like something's missing  except you aren't able to see it  so it feels like a very strange emotion. The other thing that happens is that you have a second self. Whether you like it or not  you're starting to show up online  and people are interacting with your second self when you're not there. And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open  which is basically your Facebook wall  so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night    because it's very much the equivalent. And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self. You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life. So  in the same way that you wake up  take a shower and get dressed  you have to learn to do that for your digital self. And the problem is that a lot of people now  especially adolescents  have to go through two adolescences. They have to go through their primary one  that's already awkward  and then they go through their second self's adolescence  and that's even more awkward because there's an actual history of what they've gone through online. And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now  and so it's very awkward  and it's very difficult for them to do those things. So when I was little  my dad would sit me down at night and he would say   I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.  And I said   Great.  And he said one day   What's the shortest distance between two points   And I said   Well  that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.  I thought I was very clever. He said   No  no  no. Here's a better way.  He took a piece of paper  drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched. And he said   That is the shortest distance between two points.  And I said   Dad  dad  dad  how do you do that   He said   Well  you just bend time and space  it takes an awful lot of energy  and that's just how you do it.  And I said   I want to do that.  And he said   Well  okay.  And so  when I went to sleep for the next    or    years  I was thinking at night   I want to be the first person to create a wormhole  to make things accelerate faster. And I want to make a time machine.  I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders. But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works. It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans. So I started studying anthropology. And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones  I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets. They weren't physically transporting themselves  they were mentally transporting themselves. They would click on a button  and they would be connected as A to B immediately. And I thought   Oh  wow. I found it. This is great.  So over time  time and space have compressed because of this. You can stand on one side of the world  whisper something and be heard on the other. One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use. Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time. And because of that  you start to dig around for your external memories    where did you leave them  So now we're all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we've lost on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets. And that incites a sort of panic architecture     Oh no  where's this thing   We're all  I Love Lucy  on a great assembly line of information  and we can't keep up. And so what happens is  when we bring all that into the social space  we end up checking our phones all the time. So we have this thing called ambient intimacy. It's not that we're always connected to everybody  but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want. And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone  the room would be very crowded. These are the people that you have access to right now  in general    all of these people  all of your friends and family that you can connect to. And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this. One I'm really worried about is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore  and that they aren't slowing down and stopping  being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces  paleontology and panic architecture. They're not just sitting there. And really  when you have no external input  that is a time when there is a creation of self  when you can do long term planning  when you can try and figure out who you really are. And then  once you do that  you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way  instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in    and oh  I have to do this  and I have to do this  and I have to do this. And so this is very important. I'm really worried that  especially kids today  they're not going to be dealing with this down time  that they have an instantaneous button clicking culture  and that everything comes to them  and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. So if you think about it  the world hasn't stopped either. It has its own external prosthetic devices  and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other. But when you actually visualize it  all the connections that we're doing right now    this is an image of the mapping of the Internet    it doesn't look technological. It actually looks very organic. This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we've connected in this way. And it's not that machines are taking over. It's that they're helping us to be more human  helping us to connect with each other. The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really  it ends up being more human than technology  because we're co creating each other all the time. And so this is the important point that I like to study  that things are beautiful  that it's still a human connection    it's just done in a different way. We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other  regardless of geography. So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. Thank you. If we look around us  much of what surrounds us started life as various rocks and sludge buried in the ground in various places in the world. But  of course  they don't look like rocks and sludge now. They look like TV cameras  monitors  annoying radio mics. And so this magical transformation is what I was trying to get at with my project  which became known as the Toaster Project. And it was also inspired by this quote from Douglas Adams  and the situation is from  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  And the situation it describes is the hero of the book    he's a   th century man    finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people. And he kind of assumes that  yes  he'll become    these villagers    he'll become their emperor and transform their society with his wonderful command of technology and science and the elements  but  of course  realizes that without the rest of human society  he can barely make a sandwich  let alone a toaster. But he didn't have Wikipedia. So I thought  okay  I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And  working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer  I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find  took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that  inside this object  which I'd bought for just  .   pounds  there were     different bits made out of a hundred plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had maybe nine months. So I thought  okay  I'll start with five. And these were steel  mica  plastic  copper and nickel. So  starting with steel  how do you make steel  I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said   How do you make steel   And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And my vague rememberings from GCSE science    well  steel comes from iron  so I phoned up an iron mine. And said   Hi  I'm trying to make a toaster. Can I come up and get some iron   Unfortunately  when I got there    emerges Ray. He had misheard me and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster  and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines. But after some nagging  I got him to do that. and that was produced by sea creatures     million years ago in a nice  warm  sunny atmosphere. When you study geology  you can see what's happened in the past  and there were terrific changes in the earth. Thomas Thwaites  As you can see  they had the Christmas decorations up. And of course  it wasn't actually a working mine anymore  because  though Ray was a miner there  the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction  because  of course  it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America  Australia  wherever. But anyway  I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train  and then was faced with the problem  Okay  how do you make this rock into components for a toaster  So I went back to Professor Cilliers  and he said   Go to the library.  So I did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy    completely useless for what I was trying to do. Because  of course  they don't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant. So I ended up going to the History of Science Library and looking at this book. This is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the West  at least. And there you can see that woodcut is basically what I ended up doing. But instead of a bellows  I had a leaf blower. And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project  was  the smaller the scale you want to work on  the further back in time you have to go. And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron. I dragged out this stuff  and it wasn't iron. But luckily  I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves  and at    minutes at full power  and I was able to finish off the process. So  my next    The next thing I was trying to get was copper. Again  this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world. It's not anymore  but I found a retired geology professor to take me down  and he said   Okay  I'll let you have some water from the mine.  And the reason I was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and will start picking up  dissolving the minerals from the mine. And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto  which is in Portugal. As you can see  it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it. So many such that it's now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic  toxic conditions. But anyway  the water I dragged back from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was    there was enough copper in it such that I could cast the pins of my metal electric plug. So my next thing  I was off to Scotland to get mica. And mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity. That's me getting mica. And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic  and  of course  my toaster had to have a plastic case. Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods. And so plastic comes from oil  so I phoned up BP and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the PR office at BP that it would be fantastic for them if they flew me to an oil rig and let me have a jug of oil. BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now. But even then they weren't convinced and said   Okay  we'll phone you back     never did. So I looked at other ways of making plastic. And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants  but also from starches. So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic. And for a while that was looking really good. I poured it into the mold  which you can see there  which I've made from a tree trunk. And it was looking good for a while  but I left it outside  because you had to leave it outside to dry  and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato. So kind of out of desperation  I decided that I could think laterally. And geologists have actually christened    well  they're debating whether to christen    the age that we're living in    they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene  the age of Man. And that's because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now. So suddenly  it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl and the       or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since     . And there'd also be an extinction event    like fossils would suddenly disappear. And also  I thought that there would be synthetic polymers  plastics  embedded in the rock. So I looked up a plastic    so I decided that I could mine some of this modern day rock. And I went up to Manchester to visit a place called Axion Recycling. And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE  which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive. And that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill. But this is it. So there's a picture of my toaster. That's it without the case on. And there it is on the shelves. Thanks. Bruno Giussani  I'm told you did plug it in once. TT  Yeah  I did plug it in. I don't know if you could see  but I was never able to make insulation for the wires. Kew Gardens were insistent that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree. So the wires were uninsulated. So there was     volts going through these homemade copper wires  homemade plug. And for about five seconds  the toaster toasted  but then  unfortunately  the element kind of melted itself. But I considered it a partial success  to be honest. BG  Thomas Thwaites. TT  Thanks. This room may appear to be holding     people  but there's actually so many more  because in each one of us there is a multitude of personalities. I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them  the mystic  and  the warrior.  I was born into a family of politically active  intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family that went something like this  if you are intelligent  you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see and hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So  looking for answers  I went to Catholic mass. I tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened when I was in high school  Gurus from the East started washing up on the shores of America. And I said to myself   I wanna get me one of them.  And ever since  I've been walking the mystic path  trying to peer beyond what Albert Einstein called  the optical delusion of everyday consciousness.  So what did he mean by this  I'll show you. Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room. Now  see this strange  underwater  coral reef looking thing  It's actually a person's trachea  and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now  all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology  imagine what we're missing at the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question almost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud I don't know it all. Now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this  the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening in this world right now. She's worried. She says   Excuse me  I'm pissed off  and I know a few things  and we better get busy about them right now.  I've spent my life as a warrior  working for women's issues  working on political campaigns  being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazy making  housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off  who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic    people like Martin Luther King  Jr.  who wrote   I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This   he wrote   is the interrelated structure of reality.  Then Mother Teresa  another mystic warrior  who said   The problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small.  And Nelson Mandela  who lives by the African concept of  ubuntu   which means  I need you in order to be me  and you need me in order to be you.  Now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene. But we all actually have the same capacity that they do  and we need to do their work now. I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing  the Other  by the voice we're giving to the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the U.S.  Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder    Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot    Pinheads and Patriots    Arguing With Idiots.  They're supposedly tongue in cheek  but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title that may sound familiar  but whose author may surprise you   Four and a Half Years of Struggle Against Lies  Stupidity and Cowardice.  Who wrote that  That was Adolf Hitler's first title for  Mein Kampf      My Struggle     the book that launched the Nazi party. The worst eras in human history  whether in Cambodia or Germany or Rwanda  they start like this  with negative other izing. And then they morph into violent extremism. This is why I'm launching a new initiative. And it's to help all of us  myself included  to counteract the tendency to  otherize.  And I realize we're all busy people  so don't worry  you can do this on a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative   Take the Other to Lunch.  If you are a Republican  you can take a Democrat to lunch  or if you're a Democrat  think of it as taking a Republican to lunch. Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite  I suggest you start more local  because there is no shortage of the Other right in your own neighborhood. Maybe that person who worships at the mosque  or the church or the synagogue  down the street. Or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict. Or maybe your brother in law who doesn't believe in global warming. Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you  or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears. A couple of weeks ago  I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch. Now on paper  she passed my smoking ears test. She's an activist from the Right  and I'm an activist from the Left. And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated  and you can use them too  because I know you're all going to take an Other to lunch. So first of all  decide on a goal  to get to know one person from a group you may have negatively stereotyped. And then  before you get together  agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunchmate and I came up with these  don't persuade  defend or interrupt. Be curious  be conversational  be real. And listen. From there  we dove in. And we used these questions  Share some of your life experiences with me. What issues deeply concern you  And what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side  My lunch partner and I came away with some really important insights  and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem between people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side.  What   she wanted to know.  Like we're a bunch of elitist  morally corrupt terrorist lovers.  Well  she was shocked. She thought my side beat up on her side way more often  that we called them brainless  gun toting racists  and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know. And since we had established some trust  we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities when we witnessed the kind of  otherizing  talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch  we acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried to change the other. But we also hadn't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead  we had taken first steps together  past our knee jerk reactions  to the ubuntu place  which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable seeming problems will be found. Who should you invite to lunch  Next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing  that will be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch  Will the heavens open and  We Are the World  play over the restaurant sound system  Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow  and it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense of being know it alls. It's two people  two warriors  dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it   Out beyond ideas of wrong doing and right doing  there is a field. I'll meet you there.  So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys  and it's a serious problem with boys. Their culture isn't working in schools  and I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem. First  I want to start by saying  this is a boy  and this is a girl  and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl. If I essentialize gender for you today  then you can dismiss what I have to say. So I'm not going to do that. I'm not interested in doing that. This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl. So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls  and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls. But  in fact  most boys tend to be a certain way  and most girls tend to be a certain way. And the point is that  for boys  the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now. How do we know that  The Hundred Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics. For example  for every     girls that are suspended from school  there are     boys that are suspended from school. For every     girls who are expelled from school  there are     boys who are expelled from school. For every     girls in special education  there are     boys. For every     girls with a learning disability  there are     boys. For every     girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed  we have     boys. And by the way  all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black  if you happen to be poor  if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school. And if you are a boy  you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Now there is another side to this. And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school  that salaries are still significantly lower  even when controlled for job types  and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years. That's all true. Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and   . And so we should. In fact  what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook  because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic. They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations  and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their younger years. Even in their older years  what we find is that there's still a problem. When we look at the universities     percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now  which is a significant shift. And in fact  university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to    percent female population in universities. This makes university administrators very nervous  because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys. And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university. If you talk to faculty  they may say   Ugh. Yeah  well  they're playing video games  and they're gambling online all night long  and they're playing World of Warcraft  and that's affecting their academic achievement.  Guess what  Video games are not the cause. Video games are a symptom. They were turned off a long time before they got here. So let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and   . There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today. The first is zero tolerance. A kindergarten teacher I know  her son donated all of his toys to her  and when he did  she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns. You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom. What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun  I mean  really. But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today. Now I'm not advocating for bullies. I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school. But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school  I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance. Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys. In a lot of classrooms today you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent. You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games    these topics are banned. Boy comes home from school  and he says   I hate writing.   Why do you hate writing  son  What's wrong with writing    Now I have to write what she tells me to write.   Okay  what is she telling you to write    Poems. I have to write poems. And little moments in my life. I don't want to write that stuff.   All right. Well  what do you want to write  What do you want to write about    I want to write about video games. I want to write about leveling up. I want to write about this really interesting world. I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.   All right. Okay.  You tell a teacher that  and they'll ask you  in all seriousness   Should we send this child to the psychologist   And the answer is no  he's just a boy. He's just a little boy. It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today. So that's the first reason  zero tolerance policies and the way they're lived out. The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures  there are fewer male teachers. Anybody who's over    doesn't know what this means  because in the last    years  the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half. We went from    percent to seven percent. That means that    percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women. Now what's the problem with this  Women are great. Yep  absolutely. But male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart    they've got dads  they've got pastors  they've got Cub Scout leaders  but ultimately  six hours a day  five days a week they're spending in a classroom  and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist. And so they say  I guess this really isn't a place for boys. This is a place for girls. And I'm not very good at this  so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports  or something like that  because I obviously don't belong here. Men don't belong here  that's pretty obvious. So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen. But less directly  the lack of male presence in the culture    you've got a teachers' lounge  and they're having a conversation about Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground.  What are we going to do with these boys   The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table. Are there men around that table  Are there moms who've raised boys around that table  You'll see  the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table. Third reason that boys are out of sync with school today  kindergarten is the old second grade  folks. We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there. When you're three  you better be able to write your name legibly  or else we'll consider it a developmental delay. By the time you're in first grade  you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture  maybe not  in a book of maybe    to    pages. If you don't  we're probably going to be putting you into a Title   special reading program. And if you ask Title   teachers  they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program  in the elementary grades. The reason that this is a problem is because the message that boys are getting is  you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.  The teacher's salary depends on  No Child Left Behind  and  Race to the Top  and accountability and testing and all of this. So she has to figure out a way to get all these boys through this curriculum    and girls. This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids. And what happens is  she says   Please  sit down  be quiet  do what you're told  follow the rules  manage your time  focus  be a girl.  That's what she tells them. Indirectly  that's what she tells them. And so this is a very serious problem. Where is it coming from  It's coming from us. We want our babies to read when they are six months old. Have you seen the ads  We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average  but what this does to our children is really not healthy. It's not developmentally appropriate  and it's particularly bad for boys. So what do we do  We need to meet them where they are. We need to put ourselves into boy culture. We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools. More specifically  we can do some very specific things. We can design better games. Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards. They're glorified drill and practice. They don't have the depth  the rich narrative that really engaging video games have  that the boys are really interested in. So we need to design better games. We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians. We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom. We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies. Do they make sense  We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can  trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them. All of those conversations need to be happening. There are some great examples out there of schools    the New York Times just talked about a school recently. A game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school. But it only treats a few kids  and so this isn't very scalable. We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today. We need to find more money for game design. Because good games  really good games  cost money  and World of Warcraft has quite a budget. Most of the educational games do not. Where we started  my colleagues    Mike Petner  Shawn Vashaw  myself    we started by trying to look at the teachers' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming  what do they say about it. And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school  who talk about gaming  in pretty demeaning ways. They say   Oh  yeah. They're always talking about that stuff. They're talking about their little action figures and their little achievements or merit badges  or whatever it is that they get. And they're always talking about this stuff.  And they say these things as if it's okay. But if it were your culture  think of how that might feel. It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language. They're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies. They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything. So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms. Because  ultimately  if we don't  then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying   Well I guess that was just a place for girls. It wasn't for me. So I've got to do gaming  or I've got to do sports.  If we change these things  if we pay attention to these things  and we re engage boys in their learning  they will leave the elementary schools saying   I'm smart.  Thank you. I just did something I've never done before. I spent a week at sea on a research vessel. Now I'm not a scientist  but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the boat we were on  by the way. The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff    the birds  the turtles  the dolphins  the glamorous stuff. They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff. And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton  which is very bad news  because so much life depends on it. So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how    percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it  this disaster is still unfolding. It's still working its way up the food chain. Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us. Rachel Carson    the godmother of modern environmentalism    warned us about this very thing back in     . She pointed out that the  control men     as she called them    who carpet bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT  were only trying to kill the little stuff  the insects  not the birds. But they forgot this  the fact that birds dine on grubs  that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT. And so  robin eggs failed to hatch  songbirds died en masse  towns fell silent. Thus the title  Silent Spring.  I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico  because I'm Canadian  and I can draw no ancestral ties. And I think what it is is I don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster  with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world  with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV     hours a day  for months. After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature  suddenly we were face to face with our weakness  with our lack of control  as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it     top hats    top kills  and  most memorably  the  junk shot     the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world. But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed    the carelessness  the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean up. If there is one thing BP's watery improv act made clear  it is that  as a culture  we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable  and to do so without a back up plan  without an exit strategy. And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years. Our leaders barrel into wars  telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades. Then  it is years of deadly damage control  Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter insurgencies  and once again  no exit strategy. Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence  convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market    the kind that never goes down. And when it inevitably does  the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot    in this case  throwing massive amounts of much needed public money down a very different kind of hole. As with BP  the hole does get plugged  at least temporarily  but not before exacting a tremendous price. We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen  because we are in the midst of what may be our highest stakes gamble of all    deciding what to do  or not to do  about climate change. Now as you know  a great deal of time is spent  in this country and around the world  inside the climate debate  on the question of   What if the IPC scientists are all wrong   Now a far more relevant question    as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it    is   What if those scientists are right   Given the stakes  the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle    the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible  we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty. Better to err on the side of caution. More overt  the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed  but rather on the industry that stands to profit. But climate policy in the wealthy world    to the extent that such a thing exists    is not based on precaution  but rather on cost benefit analysis    finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP. So rather than asking  as precaution would demand  what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe  we ask bizarre questions like this   What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions  Can we put this off till                    Or we ask   How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive  Can we go with two degrees  three degrees  or    where we're currently going    four degrees Celsius   And by the way  the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat  making the planet not too hot  not too cold  but just right    sort of Goldilocks style    this is pure fantasy  and it's not coming from the climate scientists. It's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science. The fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops. So once again  why do we take these crazy risks with the precious  A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now  like  greed.  This is a popular explanation  and there's lots of truth to it  because taking big risks  as we all know  pays a lot of money. Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris. And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness. For instance  if you happen to be a    year old banker taking home     times more than a brain surgeon  then you need a narrative  you need a story that makes that disparity okay. And you actually don't have a lot of options. You're either an incredibly good scammer  and you're getting away with it    you gamed the system    or you're some kind of boy genius  the likes of which the world has never seen. Now both of these options    the boy genius and the scammer    are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future. By the way  Tony Hayward  the former CEO of BP  had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan   What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail   Now this is actually a popular plaque  and this is a crowd of overachievers  so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque. Don't feel ashamed. Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk  but personally  I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall  because    maybe not that one in particular    but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time. So we have greed  we've got overconfidence hubris  but since we're here at TEDWomen  let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness. Now I'm not going to belabor this point  but studies do show that  as investors  women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men  precisely because  as we've already heard  women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do. So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides    for society at least. The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted  chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides. And this problem    call it the  perils of privilege     brings us closer  I think  to the root of our collective recklessness. Because none of us    at least in the global North    neither men nor women  are fully exempt from this message. Here's what I'm talking about. Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them  our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature    the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer  the narrative of manifest destiny  the narrative of apocalypse and salvation. And just when you think these stories are fading into history  and that we've gotten over them  they pop up in the strangest places. For instance  I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the Kansas City airport. It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone  and yes  it really does say   Slap Mother Nature in the face.  And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola    that's just a bonus. I'm showing it because    they're not a sponsor  are they     because  in its own way  this is a crass version of our founding story. We slapped Mother Nature around and won  and we always win  because dominating nature is our destiny. But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature. There's another one  equally important  about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance. Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.  The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean. The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume.  In other words  the ocean is big  she can take it. It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do. Because this is our real master narrative  however much we mess up  there will always be more    more water  more land  more untapped resources. A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way  that is the story of the settling of the Americas  the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped. And it's also the story of modern capitalism  because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system  one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers. Now the problem is that the story was always a lie. The Earth always did have limits. They were just beyond our sights. And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts. I believe that we know this  yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop. Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories  but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that  frankly  verges on camp. How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin  Now on the one hand  exhorting us to  drill  baby  drill   because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them  and on the other  glorying in the wilderness of Alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show. The twin message is as comforting as it is mad. Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall. There are still no limits. There will always be another frontier. So stop worrying and keep shopping. Now  would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show. In environmental circles  we often hear that  rather than shifting to renewables  we are continuing with business as usual. This assessment  unfortunately  is far too optimistic. The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era  the era of extreme energy. So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water  including the icy Arctic seas  where a clean up may simply be impossible. It means large scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip mining operations for coal  the likes of which we haven't yet seen. And most controversially  it means the tar sands. I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands  which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States. It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice  because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else. So this is where the tar sands live  under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests. The oil is not liquid. You can't just drill a hole and pump it out. Tar sand's oil is solid  mixed in with the soil. So to get at it  you first have to get rid of the trees. Then  you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand. The process requires a huge amount of water  which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds. That's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates. Now looking at these images  it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation  which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England. I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth  the largest ever built. That's a person down there by the wheel. My point is that this is not oil drilling. It's not even mining. It is terrestrial skinning. Vast  vivid landscapes are being gutted  left monochromatic gray. Now I should confess that as  far as  I'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon. But the truth is that  on average  turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada. How else to describe this  but as a form of mass insanity  Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet  off the power of sun  wind and waves  we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest  highest emitting stuff imaginable. This is where our story of endless growth has taken us  to this black hole at the center of my country    a place of such planetary pain that  like the BP gusher  one can only stand to look at it for so long. As Jared Diamond and others have shown us  this is how civilizations commit suicide  by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes. The problem is that our master narrative has an answer for that too. At the very last minute  we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie  just like in the Rapture. But  of course  our secular religion is technology. Now  you may have noticed more and more headlines like these. The idea behind this form of  geoengineering  as it's called  is that  as the planet heats up  we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space  thereby cooling the planet. The wackiest plan    and I'm not making this up    would put what is essentially a garden hose    and a half miles high into the sky  suspended by balloons  to spew sulfur dioxide. So  solving the problem of pollution with more pollution. Think of it as the ultimate junk shot. The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested. They don't know if they'll work  and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash. Nevertheless  the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles  particularly media circles  with a relief tinged with euphoria. An escape hatch has been reached. A new frontier has been found. Most importantly  we don't have to change our lifestyles after all. You see  for some people  their savior is a guy in a flowing robe. For other people  it's a guy with a garden hose. We badly need some new stories. We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks    risks that confront recklessness head on  that put the precautionary principle into practice  even if that means through direct action    like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested  blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop removal coal mining. We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around. That this is our only home. There is no escape hatch. Call it karma  call it physics  action and reaction  call it precaution    the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit. Thank you. You may not know this  but you are celebrating an anniversary with me. I'm not married  but one year ago today  I woke up from a month long coma  following a double lung transplant. Crazy  I know. Insane. Thank you. Six years before that  I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe  when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension    also known as PH. It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins  making the right side of the heart work overtime  and causing what I call the reverse Grinch effect. My heart was three and a half sizes too big. Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition  and usually after two to five years  you die. I went to see this specialist  and she was top of the field and told me I had to stop singing. She said   Those high notes are going to kill you.  While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension  she was absolutely emphatic I was singing my own obituary. I was very limited by my condition  physically. But I was not limited when I sang  and as air came up from my lungs  through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound  it was the closest thing I had ever come to transcendence. And just because of someone's hunch  I wasn't going to give it up. Thankfully  I met Reda Girgis  who is dry as toast  but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive  they wanted me to live a meaningful life. This meant making trade offs. I come from Colorado. It's a mile high  and I grew up there with my    brothers and sisters and two adoring parents. Well  the altitude exacerbated my symptoms. So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby. I couldn't walk as much as I used to  so I opted for five inch heels. And I gave up salt  I went vegan  and I started taking huge doses of sildenafil  also known as Viagra. My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for PH  but after six months  I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint. I had a heart catheterization  where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure  which is supposed to be between    and   . Mine was    . I like to do things big  and it meant one thing  there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan  and it's not just a drug  it's a way of life. Doctors insert a catheter into your chest  which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds. Every day     hours  that pump is at your side  administering medicine directly to your heart  and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses. This is a list of the side effects  if you eat too much salt  like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  you'll probably end up in the ICU. If you go through a metal detector  you'll probably die. If you get a bubble in your medicine    because you have to mix it every morning    and it stays in there  you probably die. If you run out of medicine  you definitely die. No one wants to go on Flolan. But when I needed it  it was a godsend. Within a few days  I could walk again. Within a few weeks  I was performing  and in a few months  I debuted at the Kennedy Center. The pump was a little bit problematic when performing  so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage. Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my Spanx  hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly. And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers. I graduated from graduate school in       and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe. A few days after arriving  I met this wonderful  old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles. And before long  I was commuting between Budapest  Milan and Florence. Though I was attached to this ugly  unwanted  high maintenance  mechanical pet  my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera    very complicated  but in a good way. Then in February of       my grandfather passed away. He was a big figure in all of our lives  and we loved him very much. It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next. Seven weeks later  I got a call from my family. My father had been in a catastrophic car accident  and he died. At     my death would have been entirely expected. But his    well  the only way I can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline. Against my doctors' and family's wishes  I needed to go back for the funeral. I had to say goodbye in some way  shape or form. But soon I was showing signs of right heart failure  and I had to return to sea level  doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again. I canceled most of my engagements that summer  but I had one left in Tel Aviv  so I went. After one performance  I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab. I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face  and in the heat of the desert  I was freezing cold. My fingers started turning blue  and I was like   What is going on here   I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed. The cab stopped  and I pulled my body from it feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator. I fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom where I found my problem  I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine. I was dying  and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast  I would never leave that apartment alive. I started mixing  and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another  but I just kept on going. Finally  with the last bottle in and the last bubble out  I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough. If it didn't  I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated. Thankfully  in a few minutes  I saw the signature hive like rash appear on my legs  which is a side effect of the medication  and I knew I'd be okay. We're not big on fear in my family  but I was scared. I went back to the States  anticipating I'd return to Europe  but the heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further that a flight for life from Johns Hopkins Hospital. I performed here and there  but as my condition deteriorated  so did my voice. My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant. I didn't. I had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries. I knew another young man  though  who had PH who died while waiting for one. I wanted to live. I thought stem cells were a good option  but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet. I officially took a break from singing  and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years  for transplant. I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon  and I asked him if I needed a transplant  what I could do to prepare. He said   Be happy. A happy patient is a healthy patient.  It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius. I still didn't want a transplant  but in a month  I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles    very attractive. And it was right heart failure. I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice. It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match. But the next morning  while I was still in the hospital  I got a telephone call. It was my doctor in Cleveland  Marie Budev. And they had lungs. It was a match. They were from Texas. And everybody was really happy for me  but me. Because  despite their problems  I had spent my whole life training my lungs  and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up. I flew to Cleveland  and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye. But organs don't wait  and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye. The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket  telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again  and to please try and save my voice. I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. During the thirteen and a half hour surgery  I flatlined twice     quarts of blood were infused into my body. And in my surgeon's    year career  he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed. They left my chest open for two weeks. You could see my over sized heart beating inside of it. I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive. An infection ravaged my skin. I had hoped my voice would be saved  but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it. If they stayed in  there was no way I would ever sing again. So my doctor got the ENT  the top guy at the clinic  to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box. He said it would kill me. So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt to save my voice. Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery  she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed. And if you want an example of perseverance  grit and strength in a beautiful  little package  it is her. One year ago to this very day  I woke up. I was    lbs. There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body. I couldn't walk  I couldn't talk  I couldn't eat  I couldn't move  I certainly couldn't sing  I couldn't even breathe  but when I looked up and I saw my mother  I couldn't help but smile. Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs  death happens. But life isn't really just about avoiding death  is it  It's about living. Medical conditions don't negate the human condition. And when people are allowed to pursue their passions  doctors will find they have better  happier and healthier patients. My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place  but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time. And I'm so grateful they did. This past summer  when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies  I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing. And I wanted to tell her  and I want to tell you  we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams. When we do  we will find that patients don't just survive  we thrive. And some of us might even sing.  Singing  French  Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to thank my pianist  Monica Lee. Thank you so much. Thank you. I am honored to be here  and I'm honored to talk about this topic  which I think is of grave importance. We've been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species  but plastic hurts people too  especially poor people. And both in the production of plastic  the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic  the people who have the bull's eye on their foreheads are poor people. People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for very good reason. People thought about   Oh  my God. This is terrible  this oil    it's in the water. It's going to destroy the living systems there. People are going to be hurt. This is a terrible thing  that the oil is going to hurt the people in the Gulf.  What people don't think about is  what if the oil had made it safely to shore  What if the oil actually got where it was trying to go  Not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming  but there's a place called  Cancer Alley   and the reason it's called  Cancer Alley  is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and  in the process  kills people. It shortens the lives of the people who live there in the Gulf. So oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there's a spill  they're a problem where there's not. And what we don't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products. The other thing that we don't often appreciate is it's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer. Poor people also suffer at the point of use. Those of us who earn a certain income level  we have something called choice. The reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices  economic choices. We actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous  poisonous plastic in them. Other people who are poor don't have those choices. So low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that have those dangerous chemicals in them that their children are using. Those are the people who wind up actually ingesting a disproportionate amount of this poisonous plastic and using it. And people say   Well  they should just buy a different product.  Well  the problem with being poor is you don't have those choices. You often have to buy the cheapest products. The cheapest products are often the most dangerous. And if that weren't bad enough  if it wasn't just the production of plastic that's giving people cancer in places like  Cancer Alley  and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use  at the point of disposal  once again  it's poor people who bear the burden. Often  we think we're doing a good thing. You're in your office  and you're drinking your bottled water  or whatever it is  and you think to yourself   Hey  I'm going to throw this away. No  I'm going to be virtuous. I'm going to put it in the blue bin.  You think   I put mine in the blue bin   and then you look at your colleague and say   Why  you cretin. You put yours in the white bin.  And we use that as a moral tickle. We feel so good about ourselves. Maybe I'll feel good myself. Not you  but I feel this way. And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel good moment. But if we were to be able to follow that little bottle on its journey  we would be shocked to discover that  all too often  that bottle is going to be put on a boat  it's going to go all the way across the ocean at some expense  and it's going to wind up in a developing country    often China. I think in our minds we imagine somebody's going to take the little bottle  say   Oh  little bottle. We're so happy to see you  little bottle.   You've served so well.  He's given a little bottle massage  a little bottle medal. And say   What would you like to do next   The little bottle says   I just don't know.  But that's not actually what happens. That bottle winds up getting burned. Recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic  the burning of the plastic  which releases incredible toxic chemicals and  once again  kills people. And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like  Cancer Alley   poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately  and then poor people  who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened  are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability. Now you think to yourself    because I know how you are    you say   That sure is terrible for those poor people. It's just awful  those poor people. I hope someone does something to help them.  But what we don't understand is    is  here we are in Los Angeles. We worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in Los Angeles. But guess what  Because they're doing so much dirty production in Asia now  because the environmental laws don't protect the people in Asia now  almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we've achieved here in California have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from Asia. So  we all are being hit. We all are being impacted. It's just the poor people get hit first and worst. But the dirty production  the burning of toxins  the lack of environmental standards in Asia is actually creating so much dirty air pollution it's coming across the ocean and has erased our gains here in California. We're back where we were in the     s. And so we're on one planet  and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems. Well the root of this problem  in my view  is the idea of disposability itself. You see  if you understand the link between what we're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we're doing to poor people  you arrive at a very troubling  but also very helpful  insight  In order to trash the planet  you have to trash people. But if you create a world where you don't trash people  you can't trash the planet. So now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea  we finally can now see that they are really  at the end of the day  one idea. And it's the idea that we don't have disposable anything. We don't have disposable resources. We don't have disposable species. And we don't have disposable people either. We don't have a throwaway planet  and we don't have throwaway children    it's all precious. And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding  new opportunities for action begin to emerge. Biomimicry  which is something that is an emerging science  winds up being a very important social justice idea. People who are just learning about this stuff  biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. Democracy  by the way  means respecting the wisdom of all people    and we'll get to that. But biomimicry means respecting the wisdom of all species. It turns out we're a pretty clever species. This big cortex  or whatever  we're pretty proud of ourselves. But if we want to make something hard  we come up   I know  I'm going to make a hard substance. I know  I'm going to get vacuums and furnaces and drag stuff out of the ground and get things hot and poison and pollute  but I got this hard thing. I'm so clever   and you look behind you  and there's destruction all around you. But guess what  You're so clever  but you're not as clever as a clam. A clamshell's hard. There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces. There's no poison. There's no pollution. It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well. Well that insight of biomimicry  of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species. I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff. I don't mean looking at it from that way    abusing the little species. I mean actually respecting them  respecting what they've achieved. That's called biomimicry  and that opens the door to zero waste production  zero pollution production    that we could actually enjoy a high quality of life  a high standard of living without trashing the planet. Well that idea of biomimicry  respecting the wisdom of all species  combined with the idea of democracy and social justice  respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people  would give us a different society. We would have a different economy. We would have a green society that Dr. King would be proud of. That should be the goal. And the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we've talked about  but it even corrupts our own society. We're so proud to live here in California. We just had this vote  and everybody's like   Well  not in our state. I don't know what those other states were doing.  Just so proud. And  yeah  I'm proud  too. But California  though we lead the world in some of the green stuff  we also  unfortunately  lead the world in some of the gulag stuff. California has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the    states. We have a moral challenge in this moment. We are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill  but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings  living people. And I would say that we live in a country    five percent of the world's population     percent of the greenhouse gases  but also    percent of the world's prisoners. One out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the United States. So that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in. And yet  as a movement that has to broaden its constituency  that has to grow  that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone  one of the challenges to the success of this movement  of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift  is people look at our movement with some suspicion. And they ask a question  and the question is  How can these people be so passionate  A poor person  a low income person  somebody in  Cancer Alley   somebody in Watts  somebody in Harlem  somebody on an Indian reservation  might say to themselves  and rightfully so   How can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle has a second chance in life  or an aluminum can has a second chance  and yet  when my child gets in trouble and goes to prison  he doesn't get a second chance   How can this movement be so passionate about saying we don't have throwaway stuff  no throwaway dead materials  and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like  Cancer Alley   And so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement. When we take on topics like this  it gives us that extra call to reach out to other movements and to become more inclusive and to grow  and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we've been in. Most of you are good  softhearted people. When you were younger  you cared about the whole world  and at some point somebody said you had to pick an issue  you had to boil your love down to an issue. Can't love the whole world    you've got to work on trees  or you've got to work on immigration. You've got to shrink it down and be about one issue. And really  they fundamentally told you   Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick. Are you going to hug a tree  or are you going to hug a child  Pick.  Well  when you start working on issues like plastic  you realize that the whole thing is connected  and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms. We can hug both. Thank you very much. I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge  the challenge of dealing with data  data that we have to deal with in medical situations. It's really a huge challenge for us. And this is our beast of burden    this is a Computer Tomography machine  a CT machine. It's a fantastic device. It uses X rays  X ray beams  that are rotating very fast around the human body. It takes about    seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine. So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care  but as I said  it's also a challenge for us. And the challenge is really found in this picture here. It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now. We're facing this problem. And let me step back in time. Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then. These machines that came out    they started coming in the     s    they would scan human bodies  and they would generate about     images of the human body. And I've taken the liberty  just for clarity  to translate that to data slices. That would correspond to about    megabytes of data  which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices. If you translate that to phone books  it's about one meter of phone books in the pile. Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have  we can  just in a few seconds  get        images out of a body  and that would correspond to about    gigabytes of data  or     phone books  and the pile would then be     meters of phone books. What's about to happen    and we're seeing this  it's beginning    a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time resolved situations as well. So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well. And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds  and that would correspond to one terabyte of data    that's         books and    kilometers of phone books. That's one patient  one data set. And this is what we have to deal with. So this is really the enormous challenge that we have. And already today    this is        images. Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this. They would put up        images  they would go like this            okay  okay. There is the problem.  They can't do that anymore. That's impossible. So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this. So what we do is that we put all these slices together. Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions  and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data  into a block of data. So this is really what we're doing. So this gigabyte or terabyte of data  we're putting it into this block. But of course  the block of data just contains the amount of X ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body. So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at. So transforming the data set into something that looks like this. And this is a challenge. This is a huge challenge for us to do that. Using computers  even though they're getting faster and better all the time  it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data  terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information. I want to look at the heart. I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver. Maybe even find a tumor  in some cases. So this is where this little dear comes into play. This is my daughter. This is as of   a.m. this morning. She's playing a computer game. She's only two years old  and she's having a blast. So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units. As long as kids are playing computer games  graphics is getting better and better and better. So please go back home  tell your kids to play more games  because that's what I need. So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data. So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices. And you know  going back maybe    years in time when I got the funding to buy my first graphics computer    it was a huge machine. It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything. I paid about one million dollars for that machine. That machine is  today  about as fast as my iPhone. So every month there are new graphics cards coming out  and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors    NVIDIA  ATI  Intel is out there as well. And you know  for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer  and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards. So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine  together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms    compressing data  extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on. So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do. This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner. You can see that this is a full data  set . It's a woman. You can see the hair. You can see the individual structures of the woman. You can see that there is  a  scattering of X rays on the teeth  the metal in the teeth. That's where those artifacts are coming from. But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer  I can just put in a clip plane. And of course all the data is inside  so I can start rotating  I can look at it from different angles  and I can see that this woman had a problem. She had a bleeding up in the brain  and that's been fixed with a little stent  a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel. And just by changing the functions  then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible. I can look at the skull structure  and I can see that  okay  this is where they opened up the skull on this woman  and that's where they went in. So these are fantastic images. They're really high resolution  and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today. Now we have really made use of this  and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system. And one of the applications that we've been working on    and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide    is the application of virtual autopsies. So again  looking at very  very large data sets  and you saw those full body scans that we can do. We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner  and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set. So this is from a virtual autopsy. And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off. First you saw the body bag that the body came in  then I'm peeling off the skin    you can see the muscles    and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman. Now at this point  I would also like to emphasize that  with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show    I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies    so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you. In the forensic case    and this is something that ... there's been approximately     cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years. So this will be the typical workflow situation. The police will decide    in the evening  when there's a case coming in    they will decide  okay  is this a case where we need to do an autopsy  So in the morning  in between six and seven in the morning  the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners. And then the radiologist  together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist  looks at the data that's coming out  and they have a joint session. And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that. Now looking at a few cases  here's one of the first cases that we had. You can really see the details of the data set. It's very high resolution  and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details. And again  it's fully interactive  so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here. Without saying too much about this case  this is a traffic accident  a drunk driver hit a woman. And it's very  very easy to see the damages on the bone structure. And the cause of death is the broken neck. And this women also ended up under the car  so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury. Here's another case  a knifing. And this is also again showing us what we can do. It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body. You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth    that's actually the filling of the teeth    but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent. Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person. The person was killed by stabs in the heart  but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs. Here's another case. It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings. Here you can see that knife went through the heart. It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part  which is difficult to do in a normal  standard  physical autopsy. So it really  really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death  and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was. Here's another case that I think is interesting. Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person. And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source  so that bullet is actually shining  and it makes it really easy to find these fragments. During a physical autopsy  if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments  that's actually quite hard to do. One of the things that I'm really  really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table. It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms  using standard graphics GPUs. It actually looks like this  just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. It really just works like a huge iPhone. So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table  and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface. So if you were thinking of buying an iPad  forget about it. This is what you want instead. Steve  I hope you're listening to this  all right. So it's a very nice little device. So if you have the opportunity  please try it out. It's really a hands on experience. So it gained some traction  and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes  but also  perhaps in the future  in a more clinical situation. There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this  if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies. Okay  now that we're talking about touch  let me move on to really  touching  data. And this is a bit of science fiction now  so we're moving into really the future. This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now  but I hope they will in the future. So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device. It's a little mechanical pen that has very  very fast step motors inside of the pen. And so I can generate a force feedback. So when I virtually touch data  it will generate forces in the pen  so I get a feedback. So in this particular situation  it's a scan of a living person. I have this pen  and I look at the data  and I move the pen towards the head  and all of a sudden I feel resistance. So I can feel the skin. If I push a little bit harder  I'll go through the skin  and I can feel the bone structure inside. If I push even harder  I'll go through the bone structure  especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft. And then I can feel the brain inside  and this will be the slushy like this. So this is really nice. And to take that even further  this is a heart. And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners  that just in  .  seconds  I can scan the whole heart  and I can do that with time resolution. So just looking at this heart  I can play back a video here. And this is Karljohan  one of my graduate students who's been working on this project. And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device  the force feedback system  and he's moving his pen towards the heart  and the heart is now beating in front of him  so he can see how the heart is beating. He's taken the pen  and he's moving it towards the heart  and he's putting it on the heart  and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient. Then he can examine how the heart is moving. He can go inside  push inside of the heart  and really feel how the valves are moving. And this  I think  is really the future for heart surgeons. I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery  and do that with high quality resolution data. So this is really neat. Now we're going even further into science fiction. And we heard a little bit about functional MRI. Now this is really an interesting project. MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain  or any part of the body. So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain  but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen. That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain. So this is something that we've been working on. And you just saw Motts the research engineer  there  going into the MRI system  and he was wearing goggles. So he could actually see things in the goggles. So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner. And this is a little bit freaky  because what Motts is seeing is actually this. He's seeing his own brain. So Motts is doing something here  and probably he is going like this with his right hand  because the left side is activated on the motor cortex. And then he can see that at the same time. These visualizations are brand new. And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. This is another sequence of Motts' brain. And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from    . So he's going             .  And then he's going backwards. And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain. Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time. We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things. You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head  because that's where he's seeing  he's seeing his own brain. And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things. The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well  and it's shining through  because all of the data is inside this volume. And in just a second here you will see    okay  here. Motts  now move your left foot. So he's going like this. For    seconds he's going like that  and all of a sudden it lights up up here. So we've got motor cortex activation up there. So this is really  really nice  and I think this is a great tool. And connecting also with the previous talk here  this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working  how the brain is working  and we can do this with very  very high visual quality and very fast resolution. Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center. So this is a CAT scan    Computer Aided Tomography. So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden  Elsa. So she came to the center  and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner. And then  of course  I get the whole data set from the lion. And I can do very nice images like this. I can peel off the layer of the lion. I can look inside of it. And we've been experimenting with this. And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology  because there's very little known about the animal anatomy. What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information. We can scan all sorts of things  all sorts of animals. The only problem is to fit it into the machine. So here's a bear. It was kind of hard to get it in. And the bear is a cuddly  friendly animal. And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear. And you might want to cuddle this one  until you change the functions and look at this. So be aware of the bear. So with that  I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images. It's a huge effort that goes into doing this  gathering the data and developing the algorithms  writing all the software. So  some very talented people. My motto is always  I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am. So thank you very much. Some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields. So tonight I'd like to tell you about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment  which is entertainment and robotics. So if we're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society  maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality that occur in the dramatic arts. I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology. Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology. With my new venture  Marilyn Monrobot  I would like to use art to create tech. So we're based in New York City. And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot  or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation  please contact me  the Bot Agent. The bot  our rising celebrity  also has his own Twitter account   robotinthewild. I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots  Data. He's named after the Star Trek character. I think he's going to be super popular. We've got the robot    in his head is a database of a lot of jokes. Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes. So it knows something about the subject  it knows about the length. It knows how much it's moving. And so it's going to try to watch your response. I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things  sort of like Netflix style  over longer term to different communities or audiences  children versus adults  different cultures. You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in. And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions. Some of you in this middle section    you have red green paddles. If you like what's going on  show the green. If you don't like the subject or the performance  you can hold the red. Now don't be shy. It's just a robot. It doesn't have feelings ... yet. And the rest of you  you still count  you still matter. There's also a microphone that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing    I hope not    to help make some of its next decisions. Right  so  let the robot stand up comedy begin. Data  Hello TEDWomen. It's an honor to be here. You guys are looking good out there. Ready for some jokes  Audience  Yeah. Data  Here's the first one. Right  so  a doctor says to his patient   I have bad news and worse news. The bad news is that you only have    hours to live.   That's terrible   said the patient.  How can the news possibly be worse    I've been trying to contact you since yesterday.  The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Heather Knight  He's talking about the Swiss. Data  Pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with   Come on buddy  I have the toe clippers right here. You get past me  the guy behind me has a spoon.  HK  He's a French robot. Data  A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods. One of them falls to the ground. He does not seem to be breathing. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls    . He gasps to the operator   My friend is dead. What can I do   The operator says   Just take it easy. I can help. First  let's make sure he's dead.  There is a silence  and the operator hears a shot. The guy's voice comes back on the line   Okay  now what   Question  Why is television called a medium  Anyone  Because it's neither rare nor well done. But to be completely honest with you  I kind of love television. Any of you like television  Audience  Yes. Data  I find it incredibly educational. Actually  as soon as someone turns it on  I go into the other room and read. That's all for now. Was that okay for my first time  You've been a great audience. Thank you. HK  Yay. So this is actually the first time we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance. So thank you all for being a part of it. There's a lot more to come. And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. Thank you very much. The world is changing with really remarkable speed. If you look at the chart at the top here  you'll see that in       these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And if you look at the chart for       it's projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy  and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy. And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis. A couple of weeks ago  I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States. Goldman Sachs projected     . The post crisis projection is     . That's just a decade away. China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects. First of all  it's a huge developing country with a population of  .  billion people  which has been growing for over    years at around    percent a year. And within a decade  it will have the largest economy in the world. Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country  rather than a developed country. Secondly  for the first time in the modern era  the dominant country in the world    which I think is what China will become    will be not from the West and from very  very different civilizational roots. Now  I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize  they also westernize. This is an illusion. It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition  markets and technology. It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture. China is not like the West  and it will not become like the West. It will remain in very fundamental respects very different. Now the big question here is obviously  how do we make sense of China  How do we try to understand what China is  And the problem we have in the West at the moment  by and large  is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms  using Western ideas. We can't. Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like  just as a beginning. The first is this  that China is not really a nation state. Okay  it's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years  but everyone who knows anything about China knows it's a lot older than this. This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in     B.C. at the end of the warring state period    the birth of modern China. And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China. Or immediately afterward  the Han Dynasty  still       years ago. And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China  which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now. Now what is extraordinary about this is  what gives China its sense of being China  what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese  comes not from the last hundred years  not from the nation state period  which is what happened in the West  but from the period  if you like  of the civilization state. I'm thinking here  for example  of customs like ancestral worship  of a very distinctive notion of the state  likewise  a very distinctive notion of the family  social relationships like guanxi  Confucian values and so on. These are all things that come from the period of the civilization state. In other words  China  unlike the Western states and most countries in the world  is shaped by its sense of civilization  its existence as a civilization state  rather than as a nation state. And there's one other thing to add to this  and that is this  Of course we know China's big  huge  demographically and geographically  with a population of  .  billion people. What we often aren't really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic  and in many ways very decentralized. You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing  even though we think this to be the case. It's never been the case. So this is China  a civilization state  rather than a nation state. And what does it mean  Well  I think it has all sorts of profound implications. I'll give you two quick ones. The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity  is the maintenance of Chinese civilization. You know        years ago  Europe  breakdown    the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire. It divided  and it's remained divided ever since. China  over the same time period  went in exactly the opposite direction  very painfully holding this huge civilization  civilization state  together. The second is maybe more prosaic  which is Hong Kong. Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in       You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was. One country  two systems. And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.  Window dressing. When China gets its hands on Hong Kong  that won't be the case.  Thirteen years on  the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in     . We were wrong. Why were we wrong  We were wrong because we thought  naturally enough  in nation state ways. Think of German unification      . What happened  Well  basically the East was swallowed by the West. One nation  one system. That is the nation state mentality. But you can't run a country like China  a civilization state  on the basis of one civilization  one system. It doesn't work. So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong    as it will be to the question of Taiwan    was a natural response  one civilization  many systems. Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China    maybe not sort of a comfortable one. The Chinese have a very  very different conception of race to most other countries. Do you know  of the  .  billion Chinese  over    percent of them think they belong to the same race  the Han  Now  this is completely different from the world's  other  most populous countries. India  the United States  Indonesia  Brazil    all of them are multiracial. The Chinese don't feel like that. China is only multiracial really at the margins. So the question is  why  Well the reason  I think  essentially is  again  back to the civilization state. A history of at least       years  a history of conquest  occupation  absorption  assimilation and so on  led to the process by which  over time  this notion of the Han emerged    of course  nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity. Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that  without the Han  China could never have held together. The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together. The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference. They really believe in their own superiority  and they are disrespectful of those who are not. Hence their attitude  for example  to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. Or let me give you my third building block  the Chinese state. Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West. Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think    in these days at least    that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy. The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state. And the reason for this is because    well  there are two reasons  I think. And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy  because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy. And the reason for this is  firstly  because the state in China is given a very special    it enjoys a very special significance as the representative  the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization  of the civilization state. This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role. And the second reason is because  whereas in Europe and North America  the state's power is continuously challenged    I mean in the European tradition  historically against the church  against other sectors of the aristocracy  against merchants and so on    for       years  the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged. It's had no serious rivals. So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history. The result  by the way  is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state. Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder  a stranger  certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained  the Chinese don't see the state like that at all. The Chinese view the state as an intimate    not just as an intimate actually  as a member of the family    not just in fact as a member of the family  but as the head of the family  the patriarch of the family. This is the Chinese view of the state    very  very different to ours. It's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West. And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here  in the Chinese context  is a new kind of paradigm  which is different from anything we've had to think about in the past. Know that China believes in the market and the state. I mean  Adam Smith  already writing in the late   th century  said   The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe.  And  apart from the Mao period  that has remained more or less the case ever since. But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state. The state is everywhere in China. I mean  it's leading firms    many of them are still publicly owned. Private firms  however large they are  like Lenovo  depend in many ways on state patronage. Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state. And the state  of course  its authority flows into lots of other areas    as we are familiar with    with something like the one child policy. Moreover  this is a very old state tradition  a very old tradition of statecraft. I mean  if you want an illustration of this  the Great Wall is one. But this is another  this is the Grand Canal  which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C. and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D. It went for       miles  linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai. So there's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China  which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today  which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China. So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China    the civilization state  the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society. And yet we still insist  by and large  in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience  looking at it through Western eyes  using Western concepts. If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong    our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect    this is the reason. Unfortunately  I think  I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality. It's kind of arrogant. It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best  and therefore we have the universal measure. And secondly  it's ignorant. We refuse to really address the issue of difference. You know  there's a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen  the American historian. And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures. But it's not. In many ways  it's the most parochial  because for     years  the West has been so dominant in the world that it's not really needed to understand other cultures  other civilizations. Because  at the end of the day  it could  if necessary by force  get its own way. Whereas those cultures    virtually the rest of the world  in fact  which have been in a far weaker position  vis a vis the West    have been thereby forced to understand the West  because of the West's presence in those societies. And therefore  they are  as a result  more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. I mean  take the question of East Asia. East Asia  Japan  Korea  China  etc.    a third of the world's population lives there. Now the largest economic region in the world. And I'll tell you now  that East Asianers  people from East Asia  are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia. Now this point is very germane  I'm afraid  to the present. Because what's happening  Back to that chart at the beginning  the Goldman Sachs chart. What is happening is that  very rapidly in historical terms  the world is being driven and shaped  not by the old developed countries  but by the developing world. We've seen this in terms of the G   usurping very rapidly the position of the G   or the G . And there are two consequences of this. First  the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world. There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago    Copenhagen  climate change conference. Europe was not at the final negotiating table. When did that last happen  I would wager it was probably about     years ago. And that is what is going to happen in the future. And the second implication is that the world will inevitably  as a consequence  become increasingly unfamiliar to us  because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with  or conversant with. And at last  I'm afraid    take Europe  America is slightly different    but Europeans by and large  I have to say  are ignorant  are unaware about the way the world is changing. Some people    I've got an English friend in China  and he said   The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.  Well  maybe that's true  maybe that's an exaggeration. But there's another problem which goes along with this    that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world    and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future. I mean  Europe once  of course  once commanded the future in its confidence. Take the   th century  for example. But this  alas  is no longer true. If you want to feel the future  if you want to taste the future  try China    there's old Confucius. This is a railway station the likes of which you've never seen before. It doesn't even look like a railway station. This is the new  Wuhan  railway station for the high speed trains. China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together. Or take this  now this is an idea  but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing. Here you have a megabus  on the upper deck carries about       people. It travels on rails down a suburban road  and the cars travel underneath it. And it does speeds of up to about     miles an hour. Now this is the way things are going to move  because China has a very specific problem  which is different from Europe and different from the United States  China has huge numbers of people and no space. So this is a solution to a situation where China's going to have many  many  many cities over    million people. Okay  so how would I like to finish  Well  what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us  I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it. But I want to argue  above all  a big picture positive for this world. For     years  the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population. That's what Europe and North America represented. The arrival of countries like China and India    between them    percent of the world's population    and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on  represent the most important single act of democratization in the last     years. Civilizations and cultures  which had been ignored  which had no voice  which were not listened to  which were not known about  will have a different sort of representation in this world. As humanists  we must welcome  surely  this transformation  and we will have to learn about these civilizations. This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early   th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea  the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa. The little boat in front of it was the one in which     years later  Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic. Or  look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in     . I think they're playing golf. Christ  the Chinese even invented golf. Welcome to the future. Thank you. I'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care  which is the patient  or  as I like to use the scientific term  people. Because we are all patients  we are all people. Even doctors are patients at some point. So I want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and  in fact  worldwide. If you want to get at the big part    I mean from a public health level  where my training is    you're looking at behavioral issues. You're looking at things where people are actually given information  and they're not following through with it. It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes  obesity  many forms of heart disease  even some forms of cancer    when you think of smoking. Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do. They know what they're supposed to be doing  but they're not doing it. Now behavior change is something that is a long standing problem in medicine. It goes all the way back to Aristotle. And doctors hate it  right  I mean  they complain about it all the time. We talk about it in terms of engagement  or non compliance. When people don't take their pills  when people don't follow doctors' orders    these are behavior problems. But for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change  there's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem. So the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision making    giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them  but actually leads them to make better decisions  better choices in their lives. One part of medicine  though  has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well  and that's dentistry. Dentistry might seem    and I think it is    many dentists would have to acknowledge it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine. Not a lot of cool  sexy stuff happening in dentistry. But they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it. It's the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system. People brush and floss their teeth. They don't do it as much as they should  but they do it. So I'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in Connecticut cooked up about    years ago. So this is an old experiment  but it's a really good one  because it was very simple  so it's an easy story to tell. So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often  and they were going to use one variable  they wanted to scare them. They wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn't brush and floss their teeth. They had a big patient population. They divided them up into two groups. They had a low fear population  where they basically gave them a    minute presentation  all based in science  but told them that  if you didn't brush and floss your teeth  you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease  you will lose your teeth  but you'll get dentures  and it won't be that bad. So that was the low fear group. The high fear group  they laid it on really thick. They showed bloody gums. They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth. They told them that their teeth were going to fall out. They said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies  and ultimately  yes  they would lose their teeth. They would get dentures  and if you got dentures  you weren't going to be able to eat corn on the cob  you weren't going to be able to eat apples  you weren't going to be able to eat steak. You'll eat mush for the rest of your life. So go brush and floss your teeth. That was the message. That was the experiment. Now they measured one other variable. They wanted to capture one other variable  which was the patients' sense of efficacy. This was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth. So they asked them at the beginning   Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program   And the people who said   Yeah  yeah. I'm pretty good about that   they were characterized as high efficacy  and the people who said   Eh  I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should   they were characterized as low efficacy. So the upshot was this. The upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all. The people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen    it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior. So fear showed up as not really the driver. It was the sense of efficacy. So I want to isolate this  because it was a great observation       years ago  right     years ago    and it's one that's laid fallow in research. It was a notion that really came out of Albert Bandura's work  who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment. The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one    that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior. In health care terms  you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health  that they can actually see their way towards getting better health  and that's a very important notion. It's an amazing notion. We don't really know how to manipulate it  though  that well. Except  maybe we do. So fear doesn't work  right  Fear doesn't work. And this is a great example of how we haven't learned that lesson at all. This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association. This is still the way we're communicating messages about health. I mean  I showed my three year old this slide last night  and he's like   Papa  why is an ambulance in these people's homes   And I had to explain   They're trying to scare people.  And I don't know if it works. Now here's what does work  personalized information works. Again  Bandura recognized this years ago  decades ago. When you give people specific information about their health  where they stand  and where they want to get to  where they might get to  that path  that notion of a path    that tends to work for behavior change. So let me just spool it out a little bit. So you start with personalized data  personalized information that comes from an individual  and then you need to connect it to their lives. You need to connect it to their lives  hopefully not in a fear based way  but one that they understand. Okay  I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated. And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers    this overload of health information that we're inundated with. But it actually hits home. It's not just hitting us in our heads  it's hitting us in our hearts. There's an emotional connection to information because it's from us. That information then needs to be connected to choices  needs to be connected to a range of options  directions that we might go to    trade offs  benefits. Finally  we need to be presented with a clear point of action. We need to connect the information always with the action  and then that action feeds back into different information  and it creates  of course  a feedback loop. Now this is a very well observed and well established notion for behavior change. But the problem is that things    in the upper right corner there    personalized data  it's been pretty hard to come by. It's a difficult and expensive commodity  until now. So I'm going to give you an example  a very simple example of how this works. So we've all seen these. These are the  your speed limit  signs. You've seen them all around  especially these days as radars are cheaper. And here's how they work in the feedback loop. So you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is     and  of course  you're going faster than that. We always are. We're always going above the speed limit. The choice in this case is pretty simple. We either keep going fast  or we slow down. We should probably slow down  and that point of action is probably now. We should take our foot off the pedal right now  and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down. They reduce speeds by about five to    percent. They last for about five miles  in which case we put our foot back on the pedal. But it works  and it even has some health repercussions. Your blood pressure might drop a little bit. Maybe there's fewer accidents  so there's public health benefits. But by and large  this is a feedback loop that's so nifty and too rare. Because in health care  most health care  the data is very removed from the action. It's very difficult to line things up so neatly. But we have an opportunity. So I want to talk about  I want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country  how we actually get information. This is a pharmaceutical ad. Actually  it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad. Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet. But it looks completely right. So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information  and it just sounds perfect. And then we turn the page of the magazine  and we see this    now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads  or to follow their ads  and to me  this is one of the most  cynical exercises in medicine. Because we know. Who among us would actually say that people read this  And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it  This is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information. There is no good faith in this. So this is a different approach. This is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School  Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin. And they created this thing called the  drug facts box.  They took inspiration from  of all things  Cap'n Crunch. They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal  works for our food  actually helps people understand what's in their food. God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies. So let me just walk through this quickly. It says very clearly what the drug is for  specifically who it is good for  so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you. You can understand exactly what the benefits are. It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what  but you get the statistics for how effective it is. And finally  you understand what those choices are. You can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects. Every time you take a drug  you're walking into a possible side effect. So it spells those out in very clean terms  and that works. So I love this. I love that drug facts box. And so I was thinking about  what's an opportunity that I could have to help people understand information  What's another latent body of information that's out there that people are really not putting to use  And so I came up with this  lab test results. Blood test results are this great source of information. They're packed with information. They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients. They go right to doctors. And God forbid    I think many doctors  if you really asked them  they don't really understand all this stuff either. This is the worst presented information. You ask Tufte  and he would say   Yes  this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible.  What we did at Wired was we went  and I got our graphic design department to re imagine these lab reports. So that's what I want to walk you through. So this is the general blood work before  and this is the after  this is what we came up with. The after takes what was four pages    that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that's just the general blood work. It goes on and on and on  all these values  all these numbers you don't know. This is our one page summary. We use the notion of color. It's an amazing notion that color could be used. So on the top level you have your overall results  the things that might jump out at you from the fine print. Then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context  and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls. In this case  this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their glucose level. Likewise  you can go over your lipids and  again  understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose. But again  always using color and personalized proximity to that information. All those other values  all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing  we summarize. We tell you that you're okay  you're normal. But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk. And then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop  we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate. And then we go a further step    we tell them what they can do. We give them some insight into what choices they can make  what actions they can take. So that's our general blood work test. Then we went to CRP test. In this case  it's a sin of omission. They have this huge amount of space  and they don't use it for anything  so we do. Now the CRP test is often done following a cholesterol test  or in conjunction with a cholesterol test. So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page  which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it. So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well. It's a protein that shows up when your blood vessels might be inflamed  which might be a risk for heart disease. What you're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language. Then we use the information that's already in the lab report. We use the person's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks. So we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is. The last one I'll show you is a PSA test. Here's the before  and here's the after. Now a lot of our effort on this one    as many of you probably know  a PSA test is a very controversial test. It's used to test for prostate cancer  but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged. And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that. We again personalized the risks. So this patient is in their   s  so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is. In this case it's about    percent  based on that. And then again  the follow up actions. So our cost for this was less than        dollars  all right. That's what Wired magazine spent on this. Why is Wired magazine doing this  Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp  the two largest lab testing companies    last year  they made profits of over     million dollars and over     million dollars respectively. Now this is not a problem of resources  this is a problem of incentives. We need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor  should not be the insurance company. It should be the patient. It's the person who actually  in the end  is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors. This is information that is incredibly powerful. It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change. But we're not using it. It's just sitting there. It's being lost. So I want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask  because I don't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports. But you can create your own feedback loop. Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions  Can I have my results  And the only acceptable answer is    What does this mean  Help me understand what the data is. What are my options  What choices are now on the table  And then  what's next  How do I integrate this information into the longer course of my life  So I want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information. This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people. You do not need to have the education level of people in this room. Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information  if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with. And engagement is essential here  because it's not just giving them information  it's giving them an opportunity to act. That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance. It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today. And this information is out there. I've been talking today about latent information  all this information that exists in the system that we're not putting to use. But there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online  and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people  to help people and to change the course of their lives. Thank you very much. I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now  but I've learned to pretend. I've learned to be flexible. In fact  I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '  s and '  s  when I was growing up  little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft  and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy    really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers  our aunts  our cousins  our sisters  and of course  the ever present media bombarding us with images and words  telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker  but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together  and she didn't buy me pink outfits. Instead  she knew what I needed  and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it up. I drew  and I drew  and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family  I could draw  do what I wanted to do  and not have to perform  not have to speak    I was very shy    and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young  we don't always know. We know there are rules out there  but we don't always know    we don't perform them right  even though we are imprinted at birth with these things  and we're told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed to be in. We're told what to wear       and how to do our hair       and how to behave. Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture. We're being corrected  and the primary policemen are women  because we are the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only that    we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all off these rules  they keep changing. We don't know what's going on half the time  so it puts us in a very tenuous position. Now if you don't like these rules  and many of us don't    I know I didn't  and I still don't  even though I follow them half the time  not quite aware that I'm following them    what better way than to change them  than  with humor  Humor relies on the traditions of a society. It takes what we know  and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress  and it makes it unexpected  and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if you put together women and humor  I think you can get change. Because women are on the ground floor  and we know the traditions so well  we can bring a different voice to the table. Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement  the assassinations  the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement  and I think I was drawing  trying to figure out what was going on. And then also my family was in chaos  and I drew to try to bring my family together       try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced  and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high heels  I didn't have to wear pink  and I could feel like I fit in. Now when I was a little older  in my   s  I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought   Well  maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning   and so I did. I became a cartoonist. And then I thought    in my   s I started thinking   Well  why don't I do something  I always loved political cartoons  so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh   Now my perspective is a particularly       my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here. Even though I've traveled a lot  I still think like an American woman. But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about are universal  of course    that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions  and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently  we have. Women  because we're on the ground  we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae. Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists  which I so enjoy  and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth  to get at the issues quickly and succinctly. And not only that  it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect  but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world    countries such as Saudi Arabia  Iran  Turkey  Argentina  France    and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties. And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions  because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition keepers  that we can have the great potential to be change agents. And I think  I truly believe  that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. Thank you. The maxim   Know thyself  has been around since the ancient Greeks. Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato  others to Pythagoras. But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first  because it's still sage advice  even today.  Know thyself.  It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless  but it rings familiar and true  doesn't it   Know thyself.  I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems  or more exactly the confusions  of consciousness. I've always been fascinated with knowing the self. This fascination led me to submerge myself in art  study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist. Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon  a thought controlled computing company. My goal  quite simply  is to help people become more in tune with themselves. I take it from this little dictum   Know thyself.  If you think about it  this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species  isn't it  I mean  it's self awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind. Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves. Under the deluge of minute to minute text conversations  emails  relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags  we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place  ourselves. Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world. And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves. We've cluttered ourselves up with all this. And we feel like we have to get far  far away to a secluded retreat  leaving it all behind. So we go far away to the top of a mountain  assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter  the chaotic everyday  and find ourselves again. But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind  what are we really achieving  It's really only a successful escape. Think of the term we use   Retreat.  This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle. It means we've got to get out of here. Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world  that in order to get inside ourselves  you have to run for the hills  And the problem with escaping your day to day life is that you have to come home eventually. So when you think about it  we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there. And eventually that vacation's got to come to an end. So my question to you is  can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape  Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek  Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions   Know thyself   I say the answer is yes. And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before    humanizing technology and furthering that age old quest of ours to more fully know the self. It's called thought controlled computing. You may or may not have noticed that I'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead. This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk. These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph. Let me show you what it looks like. That blue line there is my brainwave. It's the direct signal being recorded from my head  rendered in real time. The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency  with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here. You're actually looking inside my head as I speak. These graphs are compelling  they're undulating  but from a human's perspective  they're actually not very useful. That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it. For instance  what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment  Or what if I can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen  The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head. The more relaxed I am  the more the energy's going to fall through it. I may also be interested in knowing how focused I am  so I can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side. And the more focused my brain is  the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy. Ordinarily  I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way. As we know  our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable. We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it  and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier. This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves. We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient  our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever. I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit  but first I want to take a look at how we got here. By the way  feel free to check in on my head at any time. My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught controlled application for almost a decade now. In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind. We were making things activate  light up and work just by thinking. We were transcending the space between the mind and the device. We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind  like thought controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair. We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations  and it was really exciting. And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics. We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver      winter Olympics  were used in Vancouver  got to control the lighting on the C.N. Tower  the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds. Over    days at the Olympics       visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N. Tower  parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country        km away. So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool. But we're always interested in multi tiered levels of human interaction. And so we began looking into inventing thought controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control. And that was responsiveness. We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you. And it could join into the relationship with you. We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state. They followed these little shifts in your mental activity. So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day  on the couch in our office  the music would mellow with you. When you read  the desk lamp would get brighter. If you nod off  the system would know  dimming to darkness as you do. We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you  there's an even more valuable application than that. That you could know something about yourself. We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden. Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here. Here's an application that I created for the iPad. So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form. So you use it with your headset. The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone. In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear. In the original Zen Bound game  you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad. In the game that we created  of course  you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind. As you focus on the wooden form  it rotates. The more you focus  the faster the rotation. This is for real. This is not a fake. What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did. You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing    not just how much rope you used or what your high score is  but what was going on inside of your mind. And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves. I like to call this  intra active.  Normally we think about technology as interactive. This technology is intra active. It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward. So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop. At InteraXon  intra active technology is one of our really defining mandates. It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop. For example  thought controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus. With ADD  children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states. So you can create applications that reward focused brain states. So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it. This can be as effective as Ritalin. Perhaps even more importantly  thought controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states  so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs. The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with. We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us  what once mystified and separated us. Brainwave technology can understand us  anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs. Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan. Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight. It would be like plugging into your own personal Google. On the subject of Google  today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them. You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy  or whatever baby animals are to you  and then you can search that database  navigating with your feelings  rather than the keywords that just hint at them. Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention  just like this. Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it. As it aligns with our human behaviors  it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and  more importantly  why  creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are. With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles. When our productivity starts to slacken  we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play. Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self  what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk  Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest  or what activities brought you joy. Would you make more time for those people  Would you prioritize  Would you get a divorce  What thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives. And with this  we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time. We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on. And from this  we can learn how to change the plot  the outcome and the character of our personal stories. Two millennia ago  those Greeks had some powerful insights. They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase  when you come into contact with yourself. They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing  evolving and growing. But they understood something more fundamental    the sheer joy in discovery  the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it  the richness that we get from seeing  feeling and knowing the lives that we are. My mom's an artist  and as a child I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush. One moment it was all white space  pure possibility. The next  it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions. As I sat easel side  watching her transform canvas after canvas  I learned that you could create your own world. I learned that our own inner worlds    our ideas  emotions and imaginations    were  in fact  not bound by our brains and bodies. If you could think it  if you could discover it  you could bring it to life. To me  thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush    one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us. I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you  easel side  watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves. Thank you. My story actually began when I was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of Savannah  Georgia. And this was the     s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after Confederate war generals. We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard. And when I was five  my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting Ray bicycle. It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan. That's why they were called ape hangers. They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the     s  which I'm sure my mom didn't know. And one day I was exploring this cul de sac hidden away a few streets away. And I came back  and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly  so I decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood  and wham  I was hit by a passing sedan. My mangled body flew in one direction  my mangled bike flew in the other. And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line  and one of my neighbors came running over.  Andy  Andy  how are you doing   she said  using the name of my older brother.  I'm Bruce   I said  and promptly passed out. I broke my left femur that day    it's the largest bone in your body    and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee  and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle. And for the next    years  that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me. In fact  I made a living by walking. I traveled around the world  entered different cultures  wrote a series of books about my travels  including  Walking the Bible.  I hosted a television show by that name on PBS. I was  for all the world  the  walking guy.  Until  in May       a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones. And my doctor  on a whim  sent me to get a full body bone scan  which showed that there was some growth in my left leg. That sent me to an X ray  then to an MRI. And one afternoon  I got a call from my doctor.  The tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor.  I stopped walking  and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative. I have cancer. And to think that the tumor was in the same bone  in the same place in my body as the accident    years earlier    it seemed like too much of a coincidence. So that afternoon  I went back to my house  and my three year old identical twin daughters  Eden and Tybee Feiler  came running to meet me. They'd just turned three  and they were into all things pink and purple. In fact  we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious    although I must say  our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday  April   th. When they were born at      and      on April           our otherwise grim  humorless doctor looked at his watch  and was like   Hmm  April   th    tax day. Early filer and late filer.  The next day I came to see him. I was like   Doctor  that was a really good joke.  And he was like   You're the writer  kid.  Anyway    so they had just turned three  and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground  laughing with all the glee in the world. I crumbled. I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them  the art projects I might not mess up  the boyfriends I might not scowl at  the aisles I might not walk down. Would they wonder who I was  I thought. Would they yearn for my approval  my love  my voice  A few days later  I woke with an idea of how I might give them that voice. I would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters' lives.  I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives   I wrote these men.  They'll have loving families and welcoming homes  but they may not have me. They may not have their dad. Will you help be their dad   And I said to myself I would call this group of men  the Council of Dads.  Now as soon as I had this idea  I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay. She's a very upbeat  naturally excited person. There's this idea in this culture    I don't have to tell you    that you sort of  happy  your way through a problem. We should focus on the positive. My wife  as I said  she grew up outside of Boston. She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality. She's got big hair    although  she told me recently  I can't say she has big hair  because if I say she has big hair  people will think she's from Texas. And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia  but not to have hair from Texas. And actually  in her defense  if she were here right now  she would point out that  when we got married in Georgia  there were three questions on the marriage certificate license  the third of which was   Are you related   I said   Look  in Georgia at least we want to know. In Arkansas they don't even ask.  What I didn't tell her is  if she said   Yes   you could jump. You don't need the    day waiting period. Because you don't need the get to know you session at that point. So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea  but the next day I couldn't control myself  I told her. And she loved the idea  but she quickly started rejecting my nominees. She was like   Well  I love him  but I would never ask him for advice.  So it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends. So we decided that we needed a set of rules  and we came up with a number. And the first one was no family  only friends. We thought our family would already be there. Second  men only. We were trying to fill the dad space in the girls' lives. And then third  sort of a dad for every side. We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing. So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men. And rather than send it  I decided to read it to them in person. Linda  my wife  joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals. I sort of friend married each of these guys. And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin. Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe when I graduated from high school in the early     s. And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle. And I snuck out behind  and there was a moat  a fence and a field of cows. And Jeff came up beside me and said   So  have you ever been cow tipping   I was like   Cow tipping  He was like   Yeah. Cows sleep standing up. So if you approach them from behind  down wind  you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.  So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not  we had jumped the moat  we had climbed the fence  we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor  dozing cow. So a few weeks after my diagnosis  we went up to Vermont  and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads. And we went to this apple orchard  and I read him this letter.  Will you help be their dad   And I got to the end    he was crying and I was crying    and then he looked at me  and he said   Yes.  I was like   Yes   I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter. And frankly  although I keep getting asked this  it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances. And then I asked him a question  which I ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book. And that was   What's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls   And Jeff's advice was   Be a traveller  not a tourist. Get off the bus. Seek out what's different. Approach the cow.   So it's    years from now   I said   and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad  and I'm not here. What would you tell them   He said   I would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle. You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple  or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like  what it smells like.  And as he talked he had that glint in his eye that I first saw back in Holland    the glint that says   Let's go cow tipping   even though we never did tip the cow  even though no one tips the cow  even though cows don't sleep standing up. He said   I want to see you back here girls  at the end of this experience  covered in mud.  Two weeks after my diagnosis  a biopsy confirmed I had a seven inch osteosarcoma in my left femur. Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma. Eighty five percent are under   . Only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases. Twenty years ago  doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped  and there was a    percent survival rate. And then in the     's  they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective  and within weeks I had started that regimen. And since we are in a medical room  I went through four and a half months of chemo. Actually I had Cisplatin  Doxorubicin and very high dose Methotrexate. And then I had a    hour surgery in which my surgeon  Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York  took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium. And if you did see the Sanjay special  you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis. Then he took my fibula from my calf  cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh  where it now lives. And what he actually did was he de vascularized it from my calf and re vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip. And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle. This is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me. And my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo. It was  as we said in my house  a lost year. Because in those opening weeks  we all had nightmares. And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house  sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children sitting on my desk. And I remember a particular one night that  when you told that story of    I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland    of William Sloane Coffin    it made me think of it. Because I was in the hospital after  I think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero  and I had basically no immune system. And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body. And one night I got a call from my mother in law that my daughters  at that time three and a half  were missing me and feeling my absence. And I hung up the phone  and I put my face in my hands  and I screamed this silent scream. And what you said  Dr. Nuland    I don't know where you are    made me think of this today. Because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that I had was like a primal scream. And what was so striking    and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today    is the experience. As I became less and less human    and at this moment in my life  I was probably    pounds less than I am right now. Of course  I had no hair and no immune system. They were actually putting blood inside my body. At that moment I was less and less human  I was also  at the same time  maybe the most human I've ever been. And what was so striking about that time was  instead of repulsing people  I was actually proving to be a magnet for people. People were incredibly drawn. When my wife and I had kids  we thought it would be all hands on deck. Instead  it was everybody running the other way. And when I had cancer  we thought it'd be everybody running the other way. Instead  it was all hands on deck. And when people came to me  rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw    I was like a living ghost    they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives. Cancer  I found  is a passport to intimacy. It is an invitation  maybe even a mandate  to enter the most vital arenas of human life  the most sensitive and the most frightening  the ones that we never want to go to  but when we do go there  we feel incredibly transformed when we do. And this also happened to my girls as they began to see  and  we thought  maybe became an ounce more compassionate. One day  my daughter Tybee  Tybee came to me  and she said   I have so much love for you in my body  daddy  I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses. And when I have no more love left  I just drink milk  because that's where love comes from.  And one night my daughter Eden came to me. And as I lifted my leg out of bed  she reached for my crutches and handed them to me. In fact  if I cling to one memory of this year  it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand. I didn't need the crutch anymore  I was walking on air. And one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people. And it made me think    and I'll just note for the record    one word that I've only heard once actually was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday    the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word  friend.  And yet from everything we've been talking about    compliance  or addiction  or weight loss    we now know that community is important  and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in. And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me. And one of the things that I learned is that over time  particularly men  who used to be non communicative  are becoming more and more communicative. And that particularly happened    there was one in my life    is this Council of Dads that Linda said  what we were talking about  it's like what the moms talk about at school drop off. And no one captures this modern manhood to me more than David Black. Now David is my literary agent. He's about five foot three and a half on a good day  standing fully upright in cowboy boots. And on kind of the manly male front  he answers the phone    I can say this I guess because you've done it here    he answers the phone   Yo  motherfucker.  He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine  and on his   th birthday he bought a convertible sports car    although  like a lot of men  he's impatient  he bought it on his   th. But like a lot of modern men  he hugs  he bakes  he leaves work early to coach Little League. Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads. I was like   David cries when you invite him to take a walk.  But he's a literary agent  which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true. And this is what we wanted him to capture    what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations. And I said   What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer   And he said   A belief in themselves.   But when I came to see you   I said   I didn't believe in myself. I was at a wall.  He said   I don't see the wall   and I'm telling you the same  Don't see the wall. You may encounter one from time to time  but you've got to find a way to get over it  around it  or through it. But whatever you do  don't succumb to it. Don't give in to the wall. My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge  and during the year and a half I was on crutches  it became a sort of symbol to me. So one day near the end of my journey  I said   Come on girls  let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  We set out on crutches. I was on crutches  my wife was next to me  my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead. And because walking was one of the first things I lost  I spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts. Walking upright  we are told  is the threshold of what made us human. And yet  for the four million years humans have been walking upright  the act is essentially unchanged. As my physical therapist likes to say   Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.  You nearly fall with one leg  then you catch yourself with the other. And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches    as I did for a year and a half    is that you walk slower. You hurry  you get where you're going  but you get there alone. You go slow  you get where you're going  but you get there with this community you built along the way. At the risk of admission  I was never nicer than the year I was on crutches.     years ago  a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris. He was called a  flaneur   one who wanders the arcades. And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace. And I just love this ode to slow moving. And it's become my own motto for my girls. Take a walk with a turtle. Behold the world in pause. And this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. There's a quote from Moses on the side of the Liberty Bell  and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus  that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow. And every seven sets of seven years  the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love. That   th year is called the jubilee year  and it's the origin of that term. And though I'm shy of     it captures my own experience. My lost year was my jubilee year. By laying fallow  I planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones I love. Come the one year anniversary of my journey  I went to see my surgeon  Dr. John Healey    and by the way  Healey  great name for a doctor. He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage  which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard. And I said   Dr. Healey  if my daughters come to you one day and say  'What should I learn from my daddy's story ' what would you tell them   He said   I would tell them what I know  and that is everybody dies  but not everybody lives. I want you to live.  I wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book   The Council of Dads   and I listed these lessons  a few of which you've heard here today  Approach the cow  pack your flipflops  don't see the wall  live the questions  harvest miracles. As I looked at this list    to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living    I realized  we may have done it for our girls  but it really changed us. And that is  the secret of the Council of Dads  is that my wife and I did this in an attempt to help our daughters  but it really changed us. So I stand here today as you see now  walking without crutches or a cane. And last week I had my    month scans. And as you all know  anybody with cancer has to get follow up scans. In my case it's quarterly. And all the collective minds in this room  I dare say  can never find a solution for scan xiety. As I was going there  I was wondering  what would I say depending on what happened here. I got good news that day  and I stand here today cancer free  walking without aid and hobbling forward. And I just want to mention briefly in passing    I'm past my time limit    but I just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is  at a similar meeting  back in the spring  Anne Wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly    in a span of three weeks    put the full resources of   andMe  and we announced an initiative in July to get to decode the genome of anybody  a living person with a heart tissue  bone sarcoma. And she told me last night  in the three months since we've done it  we've gotten     people who've contributed to this program. And the epidemiologists here will tell you  that's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the United States. So if you go to   andMe  or if you go to councilofdads.com  you can click on a link. And we encourage anybody to join this effort. But I'll just close what I've been talking about by leaving you with this message  May you find an excuse to reach out to some long lost pal  or to that college roommate  or to some person you may have turned away from. May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace  or find a way to get over  around  or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams. And every now and then  find a friend  find a turtle  and take a long  slow walk. Thank you very much. I am passionate about the American landscape and how the physical form of the land  from the great Central Valley of California to the bedrock of Manhattan  has really shaped our history and our character. But one thing is clear. In the last     years alone  our country    and this is a sprawl map of America    our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet. And so  how I see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re imagine these connections and physically rebuild them. This graph represents what we're dealing with now in the built environment. And it's really a conflux of urban population rising  biodiversity plummeting and also  of course  sea levels rising and climate changing. So when I also think about design  I think about trying to rework and re engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way. And you can see from the arrow here indicating  you are here   I'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology  and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way. So the era of big infrastructure is over. I mean  these sort of top down  mono functional  capital intensive solutions are really not going to cut it. We need new tools and new approaches. Similarly  the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field  devoid of context  is really not the    excuse me  it's fairly blatant    is really not the approach that we need to take. So we need new stories  new heroes and new tools. So now I want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war  and that is the eastern oyster. So  albeit a very small creature and very modest  this creature is incredible  because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures. It can grow  you can grow it  and    did I mention     it's quite tasty. So the oyster was the basis for a manifesto like urban design project that I did about the New York Harbor called  oyster tecture.  And the core idea of oyster tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels  eelgrass and oysters    species that live in the harbor    and  at the same time  harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now. Here's a map of my city  New York City  showing inundation in red. And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about  the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island. If you look here at this map  showing everything in blue is out in the water  and everything in yellow is upland. But you can see  even just intuit  from this map  that the harbor has dredged and flattened  and went from a rich  three dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years. Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself. Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly    I will admit it. There are problems of sewage overflow and contamination  but I would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition  and it's a condition that we're all facing. And here's a map of that condition  showing the contaminants in yellow and green  exacerbated by this new flow of storm surge and sea level rise. So we really had a lot to deal with. When we started this project  one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there. And you can see from this map  there's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement. We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the Gowanus Canal itself. So our concept is really this back to the future concept  harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern. And the idea has two core stages. One is to develop a new artificial ecology  a reef out in the harbor  that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the Gowanus. Because if you have cleaner water and slower water  you can imagine a new way of living with that water. So the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way  I think. Here we are  back to our hero  the oyster. And again  it's this incredibly exciting animal. It accepts algae and detritus in one end  and through this beautiful  glamorous set of stomach organs  out the other end comes cleaner water. And one oyster can filter up to    gallons of water a day. Oyster reefs also covered about a quarter of our harbor and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days. They were key in our culture and our economy. Basically  New York was built on the backs of oystermen  and our streets were literally built over oyster shells. This image is an image of an oyster cart  which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today. So again  we got the short end of the deal there. Finally  oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures. They really become nature's wave attenuators. And they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem. Many  many species depend on them. So we were inspired by the oyster  but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster. It can move from a fertilized egg to a spat  which is when they're floating through the water  and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster  to an adult male oyster or female oyster  in a number of weeks. We reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the Gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus  then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef. And so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive. How does the reef work  Well  it's very  very simple. A core concept here is that climate change isn't something that    the answers won't land down from the Moon. And with a     billion price tag  we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what's in front of us. So this image is simply showing    it's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope. What is fuzzy rope  you ask  It's just that  it's this very inexpensive thing  available practically at your hardware store  and it's very cheap. So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project. So in the studio  rather than drawing  we began to learn how to knit. The concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on. You can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space. And that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change. It also creates this incredibly interesting  I think  new amphibious public space  where you can imagine working  you can imagine recreating in a new way. In the end  what we realized we were making was a new blue green watery park for the next watery century    an amphibious park  if you will. So get your Tevas on. So you can imagine scuba diving here. This is an image of high school students  scuba divers that we worked with on our team. So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water  and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring. Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world  this is the word  flupsy     it's short for  floating upwelling system.  And this glorious  readily available device is basically a floating raft with an oyster nursery below. So the water is churned through this raft. You can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force feed them. So rather than having    oysters  you have        oysters. And then those spat are then seeded. Here's the Gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines    the flupsification of the Gowanus. New word. And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges. And finally  how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef. I get asked two questions about this project. One is  why isn't it happening now  And the second one is  when can we eat the oysters  And the answer is  not yet  they're working. But we imagine  with our calculations  that by       you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. To conclude  this is just one cross section of one piece of city  but my dream is  my hope is  that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable  a more livable and a more delicious future. Thank you.
