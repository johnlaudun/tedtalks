What was the most difficult job you ever did  Was it working in the sun  Was it working to provide food for a family or a community  Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property  Was it working alone or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed  but that might improve human health or save a life  Was it working to build something  create something  make a work of art  Was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood or appreciated  The people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention  our love and our deepest support. But people aren't the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs. These jobs are also done by the plants  the animals and the ecosystems on our planet  including the ecosystems I study  the tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs are farmers. They provide food  income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Coral reefs are security guards. The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves  and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play. Coral reefs are chemists. The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs. And coral reefs are artists. The structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth. And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources. So for all of these reasons  all of these ecosystem services  economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. And yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain  we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that. We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer  sewage  diseases  oil  pollution  sediments. We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats  our fins  our bulldozers  and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea  warmed the waters and made storms worse. And these would all be bad on their own  but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse. I'll give you an example. Where I live and work  in Cura ao  a tropical storm went by a few years ago. And on the eastern end of the island  where the reefs are intact and thriving  you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed. But in town  where corals had died from overfishing  from pollution  the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left. This is a coral that I studied during my PhD    I got to know it quite well. And after this storm took off half of its tissue  it became infested with algae  the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died. This magnification of threats  this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the  slippery slope to slime.  It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime. Now  this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs. But I have a confession to make  that phrase drives me nuts. Whether I see it in a tweet  in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure  that phrase bothers me  because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades. And yet  almost everyone I meet  no matter how educated  is not sure what a coral is or where they come from. How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand  If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from  or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is  why would we expect them to care about saving them  So let's change that. What is a coral and where does it come from  Corals are born in a number of different ways  but most often by mass spawning  all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year  releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column  packaged into bundles with sperm cells. And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart. And hopefully    hopefully    at the surface of the ocean  they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals. And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef    so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface. When they're fertilized  they do what any other animal egg does  divides in half again and again and again. Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year. At the end of all this cell division  they turn into a swimming larva    a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed  but with all of the sensory systems that we have. They can sense color and light  textures  chemicals  pH. They can even feel pressure waves  they can hear sound. And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives. So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. They attach in the place they find most suitable  they build a skeleton underneath themselves  they build a mouth and tentacles  and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs. One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again  leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun. Given hundreds of years and many species  what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases  covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals. Now  there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet  maybe      . But these systems house millions and millions of other species  and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems  and it's where we're finding our new medicines. It's how we find new sources of food. I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura ao  where we still have reefs that look like this. But  indeed  much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this. Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs  and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes. But in my research  I'm not interested in looking backward. My colleagues and I in Cura ao are interested in looking forward at what might be. And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic. Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago  we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway. And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't. They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet. So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura ao  we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage  what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process. I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions. A few years ago we took a  D printer and we made coral choice surveys    different colors and different textures  and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle. And we found that corals  even without the biology involved  still prefer white and pink  the colors of a healthy reef. And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes  where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator. So we can use this knowledge  we can go back and say we need to restore those factors    that pink  that white  those crevices  those hard surfaces    in our conservation projects. We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater  like a sea wall or a pier. We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals. Now in addition to the surfaces  we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs. Starting about six years ago  I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled. And I tried those one by one by one  looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach. And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process. So as we speak  my colleagues in Cura ao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab  and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater. Now in addition to these tools  we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under studied. This is one of my favorite corals  and always has been  dendrogyra cylindrus  the pillar coral. I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape  because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare. Finding one of these on a reef is a treat. In fact  it's so rare  that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list. And this was in part because in over    years of research surveys  scientists had never found a baby pillar coral. We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce  or if they were still reproducing. So four years ago  we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura ao. We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida  who had seen one in       one in       and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura ao and we caught it. Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue  about to release them into the seawater. And here's a male on the right  releasing sperm. We collected this  we got it back to the lab  we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab. Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles  and thanks to the    years of practice we've had in Cura ao at raising other coral species  we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach  and turn into metamorphosed corals. So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw. And I have to say    if you think baby pandas are cute  this is cuter. So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process  the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them. And this is true all around the world  scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos  to get them to settle  maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures  so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often. But this is still so low tech. We are limited by the space on our bench  the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour. Now  compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society. We have advanced medical technology  we have defense technology  we have scientific technology  we even have advanced technology for art. But our technology for conservation is behind. Think back to the most difficult job you ever did. Many of you would say it was being a parent. My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined. I've been trying to help corals become parents for over    years now. And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul. But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents. The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago  and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab. And here you see one embryo dividing  alongside    eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up. They'll be infected with bacteria  they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance. We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef  always suffering from low fertility. Whatever the cause  we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or  yes  maybe save coral reefs. So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi. They're providing us with art and food and medicine. And we almost took out an entire generation of corals. But a few made it anyway  despite our best efforts  and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future  their coral babies. Thank you so much. What does a working mother look like  If you ask the Internet  this is what you'll be told. Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap. But no  this isn't a working mother. You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them. That theme is amazing natural lighting  which  as we all know  is the hallmark of every American workplace. There are thousands of images like these. Just put the term  working mother  into any Google image search engine  stock photo site. They're all over the Internet  they're topping blog posts and news pieces  and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us  that when it comes to new working motherhood in America  everything's fine. But it's not fine. As a country  we are sending millions of women back to work every year  incredibly and kind of horrifically soon after they give birth. That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem. I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images  which look nothing like my life  that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body. I'm just going to show you two of them. Nothing says  Give that girl a promotion  like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation. You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo  because that's not how this works  not for most working mothers. Did you know  and this will ruin your day  that every time a toilet is flushed  its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours  And yet  for many new working mothers  this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies. I put these things  a whole dozen of them  into the world. I wanted to make a point. I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door  because now  total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby. I'm going to share    of their stories with you today. They are totally real  some of them are very raw  and not one of them looks anything like this. Here's the first.  I was an active duty service member at a federal prison. I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C section. A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation ' so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway.  Most of the stories that these women  total strangers  send to me now  are not actually even about breastfeeding. A woman wrote to me to say   I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks. Emotionally  I was a wreck. Physically  I had a severe hemorrhage during labor  and major tearing  so I could barely get up  sit or walk. My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season.  I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye because then we'd be horrified  and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it. So we choose to look at  and believe  this image. I don't really know what's going on in this picture  because I find it weird and slightly creepy. Like  what is she doing  But I know what it tells us. It tells us that everything's fine. This working mother  all working mothers and all of their babies  are fine. There's nothing to see here. And anyway  women have made a choice  so none of it's even our problem. I want to break this choice thing down into two parts. The first choice says that women have chosen to work. So  that's not true. Today in America  women make up    percent of the workforce  and in    percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner. Our paid work is a part  a huge part  of the engine of this economy  and it is essential for the engines of our families. On a national level  our paid work is not optional. Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies  so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices. You know  that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing  can sound correct. I didn't make you have a baby. I certainly wasn't there when that happened. But that stance ignores a fundamental truth  which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional. The babies that women  many of them working women  are having today  will one day fill our workforce  protect our shores  make up our tax base. Our procreation on a national scale is not optional. These aren't choices. We need women to work. We need working women to have babies. So we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable  right  OK  this is pop quiz time  what percentage of working women in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave     percent.    percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby. So now you're thinking about unpaid leave. It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work. Because of the way it's structured  all kinds of exceptions  half of new mothers are ineligible for it. Here's what that looks like.  We adopted our son. When I got the call  the day he was born  I had to take off work. I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA  so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave. When I took time off to meet my newborn son  I lost my job.  These corporate stock photos hide another reality  another layer. Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave  most women can't afford to take much of it at all. A nurse told me   I didn't qualify for short term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks. We just couldn't manage any longer. Physically it was hard  but emotionally it was worse. I struggled for months being away from my son.  So this decision to go back to work so early  it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances  but it's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy. A waitress told me   With my first baby  I was back at work five weeks postpartum. With my second  I had to have major surgery after giving birth  so I waited until six weeks to go back. I had third degree tears.     percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.  I worked as a bartender and cook  average of    hours a week while pregnant. I had to return to work before my baby was a month old  working    hours a week. One of my coworkers was only able to afford    days off with her baby.  Of course  this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications. Childbirth is  and always will be  an enormous psychological event. A teacher told me   I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born. I already suffer from anxiety  but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable.  Statistically speaking  the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby  the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety  and among many potential consequences of those disorders  suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum. Heads up that this next story    I've never met this woman  but I find it hard to get through.  I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential  irreplaceable and formative time with my son. Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken. For months  all I remember is the screaming  colic  they said. On the inside  I was drowning. Every morning  I asked myself how much longer I could do it. I was allowed to bring my baby to work. I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble. I hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed. I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment. Every day  I cried all the way to work and all the way home again. I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day  I'd make up at night from home. I thought  there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this.  So those are the mothers. What of the babies  As a country  do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers  I say we don't  not until they're of working and tax paying and military serving age. We tell them we'll see them in    years  and getting there is kind of on them. One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have    or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year  so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases. But those things are hidden behind images like this. America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies. Whatever time you get together  you should be grateful for it  and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers. That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear. A woman told me   I went back at eight weeks after my C section because my husband was out of work. Without me  my daughter had failure to thrive. She wouldn't take a bottle. She started losing weight. Thankfully  my manager was very understanding. He let my mom bring my baby  who was on oxygen and a monitor  four times a shift so I could nurse her.  There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers. Care to guess who they are  The first eight make up eight million in total population. They are Papua New Guinea  Suriname and the tiny island nations of Micronesia  Marshall Islands  Nauru  Niue  Palau and Tonga. Number nine is the United States of America  with     million people. Oh  that's it. That's the end of the list. Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries  but we say   We couldn't possibly do that.  We say that the market will solve this problem  and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest educated and highest paid among us. Remember that    percent  Those middle  and low income women are not going to participate in that. We know that there are staggering economic  financial  physical and emotional costs to this approach. We have decided    decided  not an accident  to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies. We know the price tag is higher for low income women  therefore disproportionately for women of color. We pass them on anyway. All of this is to America's shame. But it's also to America's risk. Because what would happen if all of these individual so called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies. One woman told me   New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic. When we talk about expanding our family now  we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby. If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first  we might stick with one kid.  The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is  .  live births per woman. In America today  we are at  .  . We need women to have babies  and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that. What would happen to work force  to innovation  to GDP  if one by one  the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can't bear to do this thing more than once  I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading  and you've guessed what it is. It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future. Childbirth is a public good. This leave should be state subsidized. It should have no exceptions for small businesses  length of employment or entrepreneurs. It should be able to be shared between partners. I've talked today a lot about mothers  but co parents matter on so many levels. Not one more woman should have to go back to work while she is hobbling and bleeding. Not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding. Not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the NICU. Not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work  their needed work and their needed parenthood  is their problem alone. The catch is that when this is happening to a new family  it is consuming  and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before  so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf. But all of us have voices. I am done  done having babies  and you might be pre baby  you might be post baby  you might be no baby. It should not matter. We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue  or even a women's issue. This is an American issue. We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. We need to stop being comforted by them. We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world. We need to recognize that this American reality is to our dishonor and to our peril. Because this is not  this is not  and this is not what a working mother looks like. You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see. That's largely true. Actually  I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage. But there is also a lot that I can do. This is me rock climbing for the first time. Actually  I love sports and I can play many sports  like swimming  skiing  skating  scuba diving  running and so on. But there is one limitation  somebody needs to help me. I want to be independent. I lost my sight at the age of    in a swimming pool accident. I was an active  independent teenager  and suddenly I became blind. The hardest thing for me was losing my independence. Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. For example  one of my challenges was textbooks. Back then  there were no personal computers  no Internet  no smartphones. So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks  and I had to create my own books in Braille. Can you imagine  Of course  my brothers were not happy about it  and later  I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them. I think they tried to stay away from me. I don't blame them. I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone. That became my strong desire to ignite innovation. Jump ahead to the mid     s. I got to know cutting edge technologies and I thought to myself  how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille  These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. That's the moment my innovation journey began. I started developing digital book technologies  such as a digital Braille editor  digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. Today  every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks  by using personal computers and mobile devices  in Braille or in voice. This may not surprise you  since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in     . But Braille went digital many years before digital books  already in the late     s  almost    years ago. Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then. And this is actually not the first time this happened  because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation. The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities. Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life. In the '  s  people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing. I remember the first time I went on the web. I was astonished. I could access newspapers at any time and every day. I could even search for any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet  and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice  which dramatically simplified the user interface. This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in       first in Japanese and later  translated into    languages. When I developed the Home Page Reader  I got many comments from users. One that I strongly remember said   For me  the Internet is a small window to the world.  It was a revolutionary moment for the blind. The cyber world became accessible  and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses  way beyond what I imagined. It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking. Today  I am more independent  but it is still not enough. For example  when I approached the stage just now  I needed assistance. My goal is to come up here independently. And not just here. My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you. OK  now let me show you the latest technologies. This is a smartphone app that we are working on. EV  Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right. EV  Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. Chieko Asakawa  Hi  Nick  CA  Where are you going  You look so happy. Nick  Oh    well  my paper just got accepted. CA  That's great  Congratulations. Nick  Thanks. Wait    how'd you know it was me  and that I look happy  Man  Hi. CA  Oh ... hi. EV  He is not talking to you  but on his phone. EV  Potato chips. EV  Dark chocolate with almonds. EV  You gained   pounds since yesterday  take apple instead of chocolate. EV  Approaching. EV  You arrived. CA  Now ... Thank you. So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching  in which mood    we are still working on that part. And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social. So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. We call this cognitive assistance. It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers. Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities    in other words  our five senses. This technology is only in an early stage  but eventually  I'll be able to find a classroom on campus  enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me. It will become my best buddy  and yours. So  this really is a great challenge. It is a challenge that needs collaboration  which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities. Just this morning  we announced the open source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video. The frontier is the real world. The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder. I hope to work with you to explore the new era  and the next time that I'm on this stage  through technology and innovation  I will be able to walk up here all by myself. Thank you so much. Five  four  three  two  one. Official top. Plus one  two  three  four  five six  seven  eight  nine  ten. Guillaume N ry  France. Constant weight      meters  three minutes and    seconds. National record attempt.    meters.      meters  Guillaume N ry  Thank you. Thank you very much  thanks for the warm welcome. That dive you just watched is a journey    a journey between two breaths. A journey that takes place between two breaths    the last one before diving into the water  and the first one  coming back to the surface. That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility  a journey into the unknown. But it's also  and above all  an inner journey  where a number of things happen  physiologically as well as mentally. And that's why I'm here today  to share my journey with you and to take you along with me. So  we start with the last breath. As you noticed  that last breath in is slow  deep and intense. It ends with a special technique called the carp  which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it. When I leave the surface  I have about    liters of air in my lungs. As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in  the diving reflex. The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop. My heart beat will drop from about       per minute to about       beats per minute in a matter of seconds  almost immediately. Next  the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction  which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities to feed the most important organs  the lungs  the heart and the brain. This mechanism is innate. I cannot control it. If you go underwater  even if you've never done it before  you'll experience the exact same effects. All human beings share this characteristic. And what's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals    all marine mammals  dolphins  whales  sea lions  etc. When they dive deep into the ocean  these mechanisms become activated  but to a greater extent. And  of course  it works much better for them. It's absolutely fascinating. Right as I leave the surface  nature gives me a push in the right direction  allowing me to descend with confidence. So as I dive deeper into the blue  the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs. And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float  the farther down I go  the more pressure there is on my lungs  the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall. And at one point  around    or    meters down  I don't even need to swim. My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself  and I enter what's called the free fall phase. The free fall phase is the best part of the dive. It's the reason I still dive. Because it feels like you're being pulled down and you don't need to do anything. I can go from    meters to     meters without making a single movement. I let myself be pulled by the depths  and it feels like I'm flying underwater. It's truly an amazing feeling    an extraordinary feeling of freedom. And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom.    meters down     meters down  and between    and    meters  a second physiological response kicks in. My lungs reach residual volume  below which they're not supposed to be compressed  in theory. And this second response is called blood shift  or  pulmonary erection  in French. I prefer  blood shift.  So blood shift    how does it work  The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood    which is caused by the suction    so the lungs can harden and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed. It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing  from sticking together and caving in. Thanks to this phenomenon  which we also share with marine mammals  I'm able to continue with my dive.        meters down  I keep falling  faster and faster  because the pressure is crushing my body more and more. Below    meters  the pressure becomes a lot stronger  and I start to feel it physically. I really start to feel the suffocation. You can see what it looks like    not pretty at all. The diaphragm is completely collapsed  the rib cage is squeezed in  and mentally  there is something going on as well. You may be thinking   This doesn't look enjoyable. How do you do it   If I relied on my earthly reflexes    what do we do above water when there's a problem  We resist  we go against it. We fight. Underwater  that doesn't work. If you try that underwater  you might tear your lungs  spit up blood  develop an edema and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time. So what you need to do  mentally  is to tell yourself that nature and the elements are stronger than you. And so I let the water crush me. I accept the pressure and go with it. At this point  my body receives this information  and my lungs start relaxing. I relinquish all control  and relax completely. The pressure starts crushing me  and it doesn't feel bad at all. I even feel like I'm in a cocoon  protected. And the dive continues.        meters down         .     meters    the magic number. In every sport  it's a magic number. For swimmers and athletes and also for us  free divers  it's a number everyone dreams of. Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to     meters. And it's a symbolic number for us  because in the     s  doctors and physiologists did their math  and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below     meters. Below that  they said  the human body would implode. And then the Frenchman  Jacques Mayol    you all know him as the hero in  The Big Blue     came along and dived down to     meters. He even reached     meters. At that time  he was doing  no limits.  He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon  just like in the movie. Today  we go down     meters in no limit free diving. I can do     meters by simply using muscle strength. And in a way  it's all thanks to him  because he challenged known facts  and with a sweep of his hand  got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves. He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt. So I carry on with my dive.              . The bottom is getting closer.          meters. I'm at the bottom. And now  I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place. Close your eyes. Imagine you get to     meters. The surface is far  far away. You're alone. There's hardly any light. It's cold    freezing cold. The pressure is crushing you completely       times stronger than on the surface. And I know what you're thinking   This is horrible. What the hell am I doing here  He's insane.  But no. That's not what I think when I'm down there. When I'm at the bottom  I feel good. I get this extraordinary feeling of well being. Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions and let myself go. I feel great  without the need to breathe. Although  you'd agree  I should be worried. I feel like a tiny dot  a little drop of water  floating in the middle of the ocean. And each time  I picture the same image.  The Pale Blue Dot  It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to. Do you know what it is  It's planet Earth. Planet Earth  photographed by the Voyager probe  from   billion kilometers away. And it shows that our home is that small dot over there  floating in the middle of nothing. That's how I feel when I'm at the bottom  at     meters. I feel like a small dot  a speck of dust  stardust  floating in the middle of the cosmos  in the middle of nothing  in the immensity of space. It's a fascinating sensation  because when I look up  down  left  right  in front  behind  I see the same thing  the infinite deep blue. Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this    looking all around you  and seeing the same thing. It's extraordinary. And at that moment  I still get that feeling each time  building up inside of me    the feeling of humility. Looking at this picture  I feel very humble    just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom    because I'm nothing  I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space. And it still is absolutely fascinating. I decide to go back to the surface  because this is not where I belong. I belong up there  on the surface. So I start heading back up. I get something of a shock at the very moment when I decide to go up. First  because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom. It pulled you down on the way in  and will do the same on the way up. You have to swim twice as hard. Then  I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis. I don't know if you've heard of that. It's called nitrogen narcosis. It's something that happens to scuba divers  but it can happen to free divers. It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood  which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind. A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head. You can't control them  and you shouldn't try to    you have to let it happen. The more you try to control it  the harder it is to manage. Then  a third thing happens  the desire to breathe. I'm not a fish  I'm a human being  and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact. Around        meters  you start to feel the need to breathe. And with everything else that's going on  you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic. When that happens  you think   Where's the surface  I want to go up. I want to breathe now.  You should not do that. Never look up to the surface    not with your eyes  or your mind. You should never picture yourself up there. You have to stay in the present. I look at the rope right in front of me  leading me back to the surface. And I focus on that  on the present moment. Because if I think about the surface  I panic. And if I panic  it's over. Time goes faster this way. And at    meters  deliverance. I'm not alone any more. The safety divers  my guardian angels  join me. They leave the surface  we meet at    meters  and they escort me for the final few meters  where potential problems could arise. Every time I see them  I think to myself   It's thanks to you.  It's thanks to them  my team  that I'm here. It brings back the sense of humility. Without my team  without all the people around me  the adventure into the deep would be impossible. A journey into the deep is above all a group effort. So I'm happy to finish my journey with them  because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.    meters     meters  my lungs slowly return to their normal volume. Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface. Five meters below the surface  I start to breathe out  so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in. And so I arrive at the surface. Air floods into my lungs. It's like being born again  a relief. It feels good. Though the journey was extraordinary  I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body. It's an extraordinary sensation  but at the same time it's traumatizing. It's a shock to the system  as you can you imagine. I go from complete darkness to the light of day  from the near silence of the depths to the commotion up top. In terms of touch  I go from the soft  velvety feeling of the water  to air rubbing across my face. In terms of smell  there is air rushing into my lungs. And in return  my lungs open up. They were completely squashed just    seconds ago  and now  they've opened up again. So all of this affects quite a lot of things. I need a few seconds to come back  and to feel  all there  again. But that needs to happen quickly  because the judges are there to verify my performance  I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition. You saw in the video  I was doing a so called exit protocol. Once at the surface  I have    seconds to take off my nose clip  give this signal and say  English   I am OK.  Plus  you need to be bilingual. On top of everything    that's not very nice. Once the protocol is completed  the judges show me a white card  and that's when the joy starts. I can finally celebrate what has just happened. So  the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving. Luckily  it's far from just that. For the past few years  I've been trying to show another side of free diving  because the media mainly talks about competitions and records. But free diving is more than just that. It's about being at ease in the water. It's extremely beautiful  very poetic and artistic. So my wife and I decided to film it and try to show another side of it  mostly to make people want to go into the water. Let me show you some images to finish my story. It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos. I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing  you'll realize that when you stop breathing  you stop thinking  too. It calms your mind. Today  in the   st century  we're under so much pressure. Our minds are overworked  we think at a million miles an hour  we're always stressed. Being able to free dive lets you  just for a moment  relax your mind. Holding your breath underwater means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness. It means being underwater  floating  with your body completely relaxed  letting go of all your tensions. This is our plight in the   st century  our backs hurt  our necks hurt  everything hurts  because we're stressed and tense all the time. But when you're in the water  you let yourself float  as if you were in space. You let yourself go completely. It's an extraordinary feeling. You can finally get in touch with your body  mind and spirit. Everything feels better  all at once. Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly. We breathe with our first breath at birth  up until our last one. Breathing gives rhythm to our lives. Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better. Holding your breath in the sea  not necessarily at     meters  but maybe at two or three  putting on your goggles  a pair of flippers  means you can go see another world  another universe  completely magical. You can see little fish  seaweed  the flora and fauna  you can watch it all discreetly  sliding underwater  looking around  and coming back to the surface  leaving no trace. It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that. And if I may say one more thing  holding your breath  being in the water  finding this underwater world    it's all about connecting with yourself. You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory that dates back millions of years  to our marine origins. The day you get back into the water  when you hold your breath for a few seconds  you will reconnect with those origins. And I guarantee it's absolute magic. I encourage you to try it out. Thank you. Great things happen at intersections. In fact  I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections  in the liminal space  where by liminal I mean the space in between. There's freedom in that in between  freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not quite here  not quite there  a new self definition. Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind  like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris  or Times Square in New York City  both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people. Other intersections  like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma  Alabama  or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson  Missouri  also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings  ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice. Beyond the physical landscape of our planet  some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections. Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust  instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull. Stars die by this same intersection  this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms  intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things. We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us. To be intersectional  then  is to occupy a position at an intersection. I've lived the entirety of my life in the in between  in the liminal space between dreams and reality  race and gender  poverty and plenty  science and society. I am both black and a woman. Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies  this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities. I am also an astrophysicist. I study blazars  supermassive  hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand. I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was    years old. I had no idea that at that time  according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African American women in physics  only    black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics related discipline  and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy related field did so just one year before my birth. As I journeyed along my path  I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection  the tremendous opportunity to self define  the collision of expectation and experience  the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and  sometimes  the explosive pain of regeneration. I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart. Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives. This thrust my mother  my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet. Thus  I was one of roughly    percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals. Thankfully  Norfolk State University provided me with full funding  and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics. After graduation  and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics  I fell through the cracks. It was a poster that saved my dream  and some really incredible people and programs. The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists. It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl  probably around    years old  looking studiously at some physics equations. I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster  which to this day still hangs in my office. I described to them in the email my educational path  and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD. They directed me to the Fisk Vanderbilt University Bridge Program  itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions. After two years out of school  they accepted me into the program  and I found myself again on the path to the PhD. After receiving my master's at Fisk  I went on to Yale to complete my PhD. Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations  I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD. It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space. I was ostracized by many of my classmates  one of whom went so far as to invite me to  do what I really came here to do  as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up. I wish that were an isolated occurrence  but for many women of color in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  or STEM  this is something they have long endured. One hundred percent of the    women of color interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias  including being mistaken for the janitorial staff. This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women interviewed for this study  which comprised     women in total. While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position  and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs  it was a clear attempt to put me in my place. While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter  the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability. Beyond that  though  it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face. That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM  who are inexorably  unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities. STEM itself is an intersectional term  such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines. Science  the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry  physics  biology  cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics. Engineering requires the application of basic science and math to the lived experience. Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math  engineering and science. Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone  decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world. STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece. This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined with other disciplines. The purpose for this talk is twofold  first  to say directly to every black  Latina  indigenous  First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender  that you can be anything you want to be. My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist  but beyond that  anything you want. Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are  you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be. Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine. Secondly  among the most pressing issues of our time  most now find their intersection with STEM. We have as a global society solved most of the single faceted issues of our time. Those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow. Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections. We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity. One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander  a black woman plasma physicist  who passed away this past July after a    year bout with breast cancer. She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission  which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet  and the  .  billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter  two high profile scientific victories for NASA  the United States and the world. Dr. Alexander said it this way   I'm used to walking between two cultures. For me  it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can't do every day.  This shows exactly the power of a liminal person. She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time  and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was. Jessica Matthews  inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products  like soccer balls  that generate renewable energy as you play with them  said it this way   A major part of invention isn't just creating things  it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world.  The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories  the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race  gender and innovation. Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space  I'm proud to report that when I graduated  I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then     year history. I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time  things like educational inequities  police brutality  HIV AIDS  climate change  genetic editing  artificial intelligence and Mars exploration. This is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet. Women of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time. Thus  we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience. This outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people whose experiences  positive and negative  enrich the conversations in ways that outmatch even the best resourced homogenous groups. This is not a request born out of a desire to fit in. It's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity without precisely this collaboration  this bringing together of the liminal  the differently lived  distinctly experienced and disparately impacted. Simply put  we cannot be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear. Thank you. In the past few months  I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. One day  I was invited to an important event  and I wanted to wear something special and new for it. So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear. I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day  and I had access to  D printers. So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer  and I loaded the file on the printer. It just printed the pieces overnight. The next morning  I just took all the pieces  assembled them together in my hotel room  and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now. So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes. For my senior collection at fashion design school  I decided to try and  D print an entire fashion collection from my home. The problem was that I barely knew anything about  D printing  and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks. I always felt most creative when I worked from home. I loved experimenting with new materials  and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects. I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials  and then bring them home to experiment on. As you can probably imagine  my roommates didn't like that at all. So I decided to move on to working with big machines  ones that didn't fit in my living room. I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies  like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing. One summer break  I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. We worked on two incredible dresses that were  D printed. They were amazing    like you can see here. But I had a few issues with them. They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them  and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms. With  D printing  the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted  but still  they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio. Later that year  a friend gave me a  D printed necklace  printed using a home printer. I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship. So I looked at the necklace  and then I thought   If I can print a necklace from home  why not print my clothes from home  too   I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell    I could just design them and print them directly from home. I found a small makerspace  where I learned everything I know about  D printing. Right away  they literally gave me the key to the lab  so I could experiment into the night  every night. The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament  Filament is the material you feed the printer with. And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA  which is a hard and scratchy  breakable material. The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex  which is a new kind of filament. It's strong  yet very flexible. And with it  I was able to print the first garment  the red jacket that had the word  Libert       freedom  in French    embedded into it. I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. And actually  you can easily download this jacket  and easily change the word to something else. For example  your name or your sweetheart's name. So the printer plates are small  so I had to piece the garment together  just like a puzzle. And I wanted to solve another challenge. I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. That's when I found an open source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love. And with it  I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. And it actually even looks a little bit like lace. So I took his file and I modified it  and changed it  played with it    many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print another       more hours to complete printing my collection. So I brought six printers to my home and just printed     . And this is actually a really slow process  but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower    years ago  so  D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours  or even minutes. So you guys  you want to see what it looks like  Audience  Yeah  Danit Peleg  Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits. Almost everything here she's wearing  I printed from my home. Even her shoes are printed. Audience  Wow  Audience  Cool  Danit Peleg  Thank you  Rebecca. So I think in the future  materials will evolve  and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today  like cotton or silk. Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements. Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs  but now you can just download the music    digital music    directly to your phone. Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital  just like this skirt is. Thank you so much.  Thank You  Can I get a show of hands    how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year  That's pretty good. Well  it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year. And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world  sometimes  things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic. I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year. And it turns out that  although Ebola spreads through these more range limited  large droplet routes  there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin. The worst part is  when we take a look at some of the numbers  it's pretty scary. So with H N   there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to    other people. And then there was this other guy with SARS  who managed to go on a three hour flight and spread the disease to    other people. That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower. When we take a look at this  what we also find is that it's very difficult to pre screen for these diseases. So when someone actually goes on a plane  they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms  and they could  in turn  spread the disease to many other people in the cabin. How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin  as you see in blue. And then also  that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate   .   percent of pathogens near the outlets. What happens right now  though  is that we have this mixing airflow pattern. So if someone were to actually sneeze  that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter. So I thought  clearly  this is a pretty serious problem. I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane  so I decided to build a computer instead. It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics  what we're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane. And so how  essentially  this works is you would start out with these  D drawings    these are floating around in technical papers around the Internet. I take that and then I put it into this  D modeling software  really building that  D model. And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces  essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it. And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin  throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation. So what we get  actually  with the conventional cabin is this  you'll notice the middle person sneezing  and we go  Splat      it goes right into people's faces. It's pretty disgusting. From the front  you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time. And when we take a look at that from the side  you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin. The first thing I thought was   This is no good.  So I actually conducted more than    different simulations and ultimately  I came up with this solution right here. This is what I call a    patent pending    Global Inlet Director. With this  we're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about    times  and increase fresh air inhalation by about     percent. So how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material into these existing spots that are already in the plane. So it's very cost effective to install and we can do this directly overnight. All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go. And the results that we get are absolutely amazing. Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns  we can create these walls of air that come down in between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones. So you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again  but this time  we're able to effectively push that down to the filters for elimination. And same thing from the side  you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down. So if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed  you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes  and this time  we're pushing that straight down into the outlet before it gets a chance to infect any other people. So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all. Take a look at that from the side as well  you see a very efficient system. And in short  with this system  we win. When we take a look at what this means  what we see is that this not only works if the middle passenger sneezes  but also if the window seat passenger sneezes or if the aisle seat passenger sneezes. And so with this solution  what does this mean for the world  Well  when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life  we can see with this  D model that I built over here  essentially using  D printing  we can see those same airflow patterns coming down  right to the passengers. In the past  the SARS epidemic actually cost the world about    billion dollars. And in the future  a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars. So before  it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months  spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something. But now  we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away. So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification  flight testing  and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes. But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions. And two years ago  even  this project would not have happened  just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it. But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is  it's really the golden era for innovation. And so the question I ask all of you today is  why wait  Together  we can build the future today. Thanks. Nicole Paris  TEDYouth  make some noise  TEDYouth  make some    Are you ready  Are you ready  Ed Cage  Yeah  yeah  yeah  EC  Y'all like that  Let me show you how we used to do it    NP  Get it pops  go ahead. EC  ... when I was growing up in the '  s. NP  Pops  pops  pops  pops  pops  pops  hold up  hold up  hold up  hold up  Oh my God. OK  he's trying to battle me. Hold on  right now  hold on. Do you remember when you used to beatbox me to sleep  EC  Yeah  yeah  I remember. That's when she was a little baby. We would do something like this. NP  I remember that. NP  All right  pops  pops  pops  chill out  chill out. Hold up  hold up  hold up. EC  Y'all remember the video. This is like a little payback or something for    million people calling me the loser. NP  Hold up  hold up. But a lot of people out there don't really know what beatboxing is  where it started from. EC  Right  right. NP  Where it came from. So why don't you give them a little history    just a tickle    a bit of history of where it comes from. EC  Beatbox started here in New York. That's right  that's right. New York  New York  Everybody like   Yeah   Well  we from St. Louis. NP  Now you can put y'all hands down. EC  But beatbox started here in New York. What you would have is that  when we would go to parties  you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper. But because I don't have electricity coming out of me  we had to emulate what the beats was doing. So when you would see the beatboxer  you would see us over to the side. Then you would see a rapper  and when the rapper began to rap  we would do a simple beat  because back then the beats were simple    or    Those were simple beats. But now  you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now  and they want to humiliate their father  which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you  pay all your tuition   Nicole laughs  especially when you have    million people that just go around and call you  the loser.  Well  I'm taking that to heart. But now we do something different in our house  so we have these jam sessions  and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church. You know  in church  we'll look at each other like  and we'll text the beat to each other. Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking  road trips  airports. NP  Standing right there in the corner   Aw  Dad    listen to that.  Naw  I'm kidding. But you know what  We're talking all about this jam session and everything. EC  Yeah. NP  Why don't we give them a little peek  just a tiny bit of our jam session  NP  Y'all want to hear some jam session  EC  Y'all ready for a jam session  NP  Sorry  I can't hear you. Yeah  Kick it  pops  NP  I'm getting ready to go  EC  Y'all ready  Everybody stand up  Come on  everybody stand up  Get on up  Come on  stretch  NP  That's it. Thank you  Make some noise  EG  Thank you  everybody  NP  Make some noise  Make some noise  Thank you  So when I was a kid ... this was my team. I stunk at sports. I didn't like to play them  I didn't like to watch them. So this is what I did. I went fishing. And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut  and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis. But after I grew up and went to college  and I came home in the early   's  this is what I found. My team had shrunk. It was like literally having your roster devastated. And as I sort of looked into that  from a very personal point of view as a fisherman  I started to kind of figure out  well  what was the rest of the world thinking about it  First place I started to look was fish markets. And when I went to fish markets  in spite of where I was    whether I was in North Carolina  or Paris  or London  or wherever    I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures  again and again    on the menus  on ice    shrimp  tuna  salmon and cod. And I thought this was pretty strange  and as I looked at it  I was wondering  did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market  Well  when I looked into it  I realized that people didn't look at it as their team. Ordinary people  the way they looked at seafood was like this. It's not an unusual human characteristic to reduce the natural world down to very few elements. We did it before         years ago  when we came out of our caves. If you look at fire pits from        years ago  you'll see raccoons  you'll see  you know  wolves  you'll see all kinds of different creatures. But if you telescope to the age of    you know        years ago  you'll see these four mammals  pigs  cows  sheep and goats. It's true of birds  too. You look at the menus in New York City restaurants     years ago      years ago  you'll see snipe  woodcock  grouse  dozens of ducks  dozens of geese. But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry  and you'll see four  turkeys  ducks  chicken and geese. So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction. But how have we headed in this direction  Well ... first it's a very  very new problem. This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last    years. World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish. All of the technology that we perfected during World War II    sonar  lightweight polymers    all these things were redirected towards fish. And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity  quadrupling in the course of time  from the end of World War II to the present time. And right now that means we're taking between    and    million metric tons out of the sea every year. That's the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year. And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world. Well  that's only half the story. The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture  which is now  only in the last year or two  starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce. So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together  you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year. And again  it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example  because China  in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish  is also the biggest farmer of fish. So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now. The first one    by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West  is shrimp. Shrimp in the wild    as a wild product    is a terrible product.           pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market. They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market. In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University  it was found that dragging for shrimp is one of the most carbon intensive ways of fishing that you can find. So you can farm them  and people do farm them  and they farm them a lot in this very area. Problem is ... the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats    in mangrove forests. Now look at those lovely roots coming down. Those are the things that hold soil together  protect coasts  create habitats for all sorts of young fish  young shrimp  all sorts of things that are important to this environment. Well  this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests. We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves over the last    or    years. That rate of destruction has slowed  but we're still in a major mangrove deficit. The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called  Grinding Nemo.  This phenomenon is very  very relevant to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef. Because what's going on right now  we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp  catching a huge amount of bycatch  that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food. And sometimes  many of these vessels    manned by slaves    are catching these so called  trash fish   fish that we would love to see on a reef  grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed    an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp. The next most consumed seafood in America  and also throughout the West  is tuna. So tuna is this ultimate global fish. These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed. Our own management area  called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization  is called ICCAT  the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it   The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas.  Of course we've seen incredible improvement in ICCAT in the last few years  there is total room for improvement  but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish  and to manage it  we have to manage the globe. Well  we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture. Many people don't know this but tuna are warm blooded. They can heat their bodies    degrees above ambient temperature  they can swim at over    miles an hour. So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish  right  A farmed fish is    or a fish is cold blooded  it doesn't move too much. That's a great thing for growing protein. But if you've got this crazy  wild creature that swims at    miles an hour and heats its blood    not a great candidate for aquaculture. The next creature    most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West    is salmon. Now salmon got its plundering  too  but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing. This is my home state of Connecticut. Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon. But if you look at this map of Connecticut  every dot on that map is a dam. There are over       dams in the state of Connecticut. I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight    If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi  I feel that we could have an infinitely better world. But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers  and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me  he says   You know  you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut  cause we here in North Carolina  we got        dams.  So it's a national epidemic  it's an international epidemic. And there are dams everywhere  and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. So as a result  we've turned to aquaculture  and salmon is one the most successful  at least from a numbers point of view. When they first started farming salmon  it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish to make a single pound of salmon. The industry has  to its credit  greatly improved. They've gotten it below two to one  although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced  they're measuring pellets    pounds of pellets per pound of salmon. Those pellets are in turn reduced fish. So the actual    what's called the FIFO  the fish in and the fish out    kind of hard to say. But in any case  credit to the industry  it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon. Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we're producing. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet. It's growing at something like seven percent per year. And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market  we're still killing a lot of these little fish. And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to  we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs. So we've got chickens and they're eating fish  but weirdly  we also have fish that are eating chickens. Because the byproducts of chickens    feathers  blood  bone    get ground up and fed to fish. So I often wonder  is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish  It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway    All together  though  it results in a terrible mess. What you're talking about is something between    and    million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up. That's the equivalent of a third of a China  or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the sea each and every year. The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing. It's what the industry calls  whitefish.  There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story  I think  is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation  the Filet O Fish sandwich. So the Filet O Fish sandwich actually started as halibut. And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday  nobody came. Because it was a Catholic community  they needed fish. So he went to Ray Kroc and he said   I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich  going to be made out of halibut.  Ray Kroc said   I don't think it's going to work. I want to do a Hula Burger  and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun. But let's do this  let's have a bet. Whosever sandwich sells more  that will be the winning sandwich.  Well  it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win. So he made his halibut sandwich. Unfortunately though  the sandwich came in at    cents. Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at    cents  so he turned to Atlantic cod. We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England. So now the Filet O Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock  it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States    to   billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year. If we go through the pollock  the next choice is probably going to be tilapia. Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of    years ago. It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein  and it's been a godsend to the third world. It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution  it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months. The problem is that when you look about the West  it doesn't do what the West wants it to do. It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile. It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega  s that we all think are going to make us live forever. So what do we do  I mean  first of all  what about this poor fish  the clupeids  The fish that represent a huge part of that    to    million metric tons. Well  one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them  Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon  There are arguments for it. They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market  a fraction of the fuel cost of say  shrimp  and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale. They also are omega   rich  a great source for EPA and DHA. So that is a potential. And if we were to go down that route what I would say is  instead of paying a few bucks a pound    or a few bucks a ton  really    and making it into aquafeed  could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish  Other possibility though  which is much more interesting  is looking at bivalves  particularly mussels. Now  mussels are very high in EPA and DHA  they're similar to canned tuna. They're also extremely fuel efficient. To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market. They require no forage fish  they actually get their omega  s by filtering the water of microalgae. In fact  that's where omega  s come from  they don't come from fish. Microalgae make the omega  s  they're only bioconcentrated in fish. Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration. A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day. And this is incredibly important when we look at the world. Right now  nitrification  overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms. Over     new dead zones have been created in the last    years  tremendous sources of marine life death. We also could look at not a fish at all. We could look at a vegetable. We could look at seaweed  the kelps  all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega  s  can be high in proteins  tremendously good things. They filter the water just like mussels do. And weirdly enough  it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows. Now  I'm not a big fan of cattle. But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited  you're growing seaweed in the water  you don't have to water it    major consideration. And the last fish is a question mark. We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us. This creature would have to be vegetarian  it would have to be fast growing  it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile  that EPA  DHA  omega   fatty acid profile that we're looking for. This exists kind of on paper. I have been reporting on these subjects for    years. Every time I do a new story  somebody tells me   We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out. We can produce a fish that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega  s.  Great. It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up. It is time to scale this up. If we do     million metric tons of seafood  a third of the world catch  stays in the water. So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with. We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds. But if we went with this  or some configuration of it  we might have a little more of this. Thank you. We're at a tipping point in human history  a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home. Even in just the past few years  we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe. NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars  indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy. Kepler is a space telescope that measures the subtle dimming of stars as planets pass in front of them  blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us. Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star. Together  this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky  like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System  and also how much light they receive from their parent sun. In turn  this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not. Unfortunately  at the same time as we're discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds  our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity.      was the hottest year on record. Glaciers and sea ice that have been with us for millennia are now disappearing in a matter of decades. These planetary scale environmental  changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course. But I'm not a climate scientist  I'm an astronomer. I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet. You could say that I look for choice alien real estate. Now  as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe  I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth  the more you appreciate our own planet itself. Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best  those of our own Solar System. Consider our neighbor  Mars. Mars is small and rocky  and though it's a bit far from the Sun  it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler. Indeed  it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past  and in part  this is why we study Mars so much. Our rovers  like Curiosity  crawl across its surface  scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it. Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere  trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability. Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars. But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world  places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers  compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live. Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet  places that are lush by comparison with Mars. Even in the driest  highest places on Earth  the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests. I worry    I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long  dark shadow  the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of  the Earth. As much as I love interplanetary exploration  I deeply disagree with this idea. There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars  but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats. Thank you. But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another. No  they're in fact two sides of the same goal  to understand  preserve and improve life into the future. The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas. They're just closer to home. If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile  inhospitable spaces here on Earth  perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it. I leave you with a final thought experiment  Fermi's paradox. Many years ago  the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that  given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it  we should have found evidence for alien life by now. So where are they  Well  one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that  as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars  they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with. It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves  but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together. If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation  then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth. Thank you. So  I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you. Over the past    years in the UK  the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market by a ratio of around three to one. There are private cemeteries being set up with plots for sale to investors  and they start at around       pounds. And they're projected to achieve about    percent growth. The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand. Now  this is a real proposition  and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment  but my interest in it is quite different. I'm an architect and urban designer  and for the past year and a half  I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them. So in the summer  I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice  and it was called  Death in Venice.  And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about  the exhibition was designed to be quite playful  so that people would literally engage with it. So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death. As you wave your hand across the map  the name of the piece of real estate    the building or the cemetery    is revealed. And those white shapes that you can see  they're all of the hospitals and hospices and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city. In fact  the majority are cemeteries. We wanted to show that  even though death and burial are things that we might not think about  they're all around us  and they're important parts of our cities. So about half a million people die in the UK each year  and of those  around a quarter will want to be buried. But the UK  like many Western European countries  is running out of burial space  especially in the major cities. And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while  and the main causes are population growth  the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full. There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever  and there's also development pressure    people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops. So they came up with a few solutions. They were like  well  maybe we can reuse those graves after    years. Or maybe we can bury people  like  four deep  so that four people can be buried in the same plot  and we can make more efficient use of the land that way  and in that way  hopefully London will still have space to bury people in the near future. But  traditionally  cemeteries haven't been taken care of by the local authority. In fact  the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation on anyone in the UK to provide burial space. Traditionally  it's been done by private and religious organizations  like churches and mosques and synagogues. But there's also occasionally been a for profit group who has wanted to get in on the act. And  you know  they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost  and it looks like there's serious money to be made. So  actually  if you want to go out and start your own cemetery  you kind of can. There was this couple in South Wales  and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it  and they wanted to develop the land. They had a load of ideas. They first thought about making a caravan park  but the council said no. And then they wanted to make a fish farm and again the council said no. Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this  they could increase the value of their land from about        pounds to over one million pounds. But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries  like  it's kind of ludicrous  right  The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading. They look like they're expensive  but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot    like  someone has to cut the grass for the next    years. That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries. And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not for profit group. But anyway  the council granted these people permission  and they're now trying to build their cemetery. So just to explain to you kind of how this works  If I want to build something in the UK  like a cemetery for example  then I have to apply for planning permission first. So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or  you know  if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office  I have to do a load of drawings  and I submit them to the council for permission. And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings. So they'll look at what it looks like. But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment  And they'll be thinking about things like  is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that I've built  But also good things. Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use  And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they'll make a decision. So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery. But what if I've got a piece of land and I just want to bury a few people  like five or six  Well  then    actually  I don't need permission from anyone  There's actually almost no regulation in the UK around burial  and the little bit that there is  is about not polluting water courses  like not polluting rivers or groundwater. So actually  if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery  then you can. But I mean  like    really  who does this  Right  Well  if you're an aristocratic family and you have a large estate  then there's a chance that you'll have a mausoleum on it  and you'll bury your family there. But the really weird thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you're allowed to start burying people on it. And so that means that  technically  this applies to  like  the back garden of your house in the suburbs. So what if you wanted to try this yourself at home  Well  there's a few councils that have guidance on their website which can help you. So  the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead    you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio. They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is. But that's pretty much it for formal requirements. Now  they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this  but  legally speaking  there's almost nothing that they can do about it. And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make  they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by    percent. Although  actually  it's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that. So what I find fascinating about this is the fact that it kind of sums up many of our attitudes towards death. In the UK  and I think that the figures across Europe are probably similar  only about    percent of people have ever talked to anyone about their wishes around death  and even for people over     only    percent of people have ever talked about this. And the reasons that people give ... you know  they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it. And you know  to a certain extent  there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us. The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death  for example  and there's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives to this issue. But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities  there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine. So we're not thinking about this  but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it    they're not taking care of it either. Thank you. Pat Mitchell  So I was thinking about female friendship a lot  and by the way  these two women  I'm very honored to say  have been my friends for a very long time  too. Jane Fonda  Yes we have. PM  And one of the things that I read about female friendship is something that Cervantes said. He said   You can tell a lot about someone   in this case a woman   by the company that she keeps.  So let's start with    JF  We're in big trouble. Lily Tomlin  Hand me one of those waters  I'm extremely dry. JF  You're taking up our time. We have a very limited    LT  Just being with her sucks the life out of me. JF  You ain't seen nothing yet. Anyway    sorry. PM  So tell me  what do you look for in a friend  LT  I look for someone who has a sense of fun  who's audacious  who's forthcoming  who has politics  who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet  someone who's decent  has a sense of justice and who thinks I'm worthwhile. JF  You know  I was thinking this morning  I don't even know what I would do without my women friends. I mean it's   I have my friends  therefore I am.  LT   Laughter  JF  No  it's true. I exist because I have my women friends. They    You're one of them. I don't know about you. But anyway    You know  they make me stronger  they make me smarter  they make me braver. They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course correcting. And most of them are a good deal younger than me  too. You know  I mean  it's nice    LT  Thank you. JF  No  I do  I include you in that  because listen  you know    it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end. I'm approaching    I'll be there sooner than you. LT  No  I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me. JF  I'm showing you the way. LT  Well  you are and you have. PM  Well  as we grow older  and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys  what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive  LT  Well you have to use a lot of    JF  She doesn't invite me over much  I'll tell you that. LT  I have to use a lot of social media    You be quiet now. And so    LT  And I look through my emails  I look through my texts to find my friends  so I can answer them as quickly as possible  because I know they need my counsel. They need my support  because most of my friends are writers  or activists  or actors  and you're all three ... and a long string of other descriptive phrases  and I want to get to you as soon as possible  I want you to know that I'm there for you. JF  Do you do emojis  LT  Oh ... JF  No  LT  That's embarrassing. JF  I'm really into emojis. LT  No  I spell out my    I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations  and sadness. JF  You spell it right out    LT  I spell it  every letter. JF  Such a purist. You know  as I've gotten older  I've understood more the importance of friendships  and so  I really make an effort to reach out and make play dates    not let too much time go by. I read a lot so  as Lily knows all too well  my books that I like  I send to my friends. LT  When we knew we would be here today you sent me a lot of books about women  female friendships  and I was so surprised to see how many books  how much research has been done recently    JF  And were you grateful  LT  I was grateful. PM  And    LT  Wait  no  it's really important because this is another example of how women are overlooked  put aside  marginalized. There's been very little research done on us  even though we volunteered lots of times. JF  That's for sure. LT  This is really exciting  and you all will be interested in this. The Harvard Medical School study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments    physical impairments as they age  and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital  exciting    JF  And longer    LT  Joyful lives. JF  We live five years longer than men. LT  I think I'd trade the years for joy. LT  But the most important part is they found    the results were so exciting and so conclusive    the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health  as much as smoking or being overweight. JF  And there's something else  too    LT  I've said my part  so ... JF  OK  well  listen to my part  because there's an additional thing. Because they only    for years  decades    they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress  only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed  and it turns out that when we're stressed    women  our bodies get flooded by oxytocin. Which is a feel good  calming  stress reducing hormone. Which is also increased when we're with our women friends. And I do think that's one reason why we live longer. And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that. Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin. LT  Well  when you and I and Dolly made    to    ... JF  Oh    LT  We laughed  we did  we laughed so much  we found we had so much in common and we're so different. Here she is  like Hollywood royalty  I'm like a tough kid from Detroit   Dolly's  a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee  and we found we were so in sync as women  and we must have    we laughed    we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans. JF  I think    we sure crossed our legs a lot. If you know what I mean. LT  I think we all know what you mean. PM  You're adding decades to our lives right now. So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly  Sister Joan Chittister  who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act  they're a spiritual act. Do you think of your friends as spiritual  Do they add something spiritual to your lives  LT  Spiritual    I absolutely think that. Because    especially people you've known a long time  people you've spent time with    I can see the spiritual essence inside them  the tenderness  the vulnerability. There's actually kind of a love  an element of love in the relationship. I just see deeply into your soul. PM  Do you think that  Jane    LT  But I have special powers. JF  Well  there's all kinds of friends. There's business friends  and party friends  I've got a lot of those. But the oxytocin producing friendships have ... They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening  right  You know  we go deep. And    I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends. Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them. LT  And you know one of you is going to go soon. PM  Well  two of us are sitting here  Lily  which one are you talking about  And I always think  when women talk about their friendships  that men always look a little mystified. What are the differences  in your opinion  between men friendships and women friendships  JF  There's a lot of difference  and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men    that they don't have what we have. Which I think may be why they die sooner. I have a lot of compassion for men  because women  no kidding  we    women's relationships  our friendships are full disclosure  we go deep. They're revelatory. We risk vulnerability    this is something men don't do. I mean how many times have I asked you   Am I doing OK    Did I really screw up there   PM  You're doing great. JF  But I mean  we ask questions like that of our women friends  and men don't. You know  people describe women's relationships as face to face  whereas men's friendships are more side by side. LT  I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions  they want to bury deeper feelings. I mean  that's the general  conventional thought. They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls  or talk about sports  or hunting  or cars or have sex. I mean  it's just the kind of    it's a more manly behavior. JF  You meant    LT  They talk about sex. I meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to    JF  You know something  though  that I find very interesting    and again  psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently    is that men are born every bit as relational as women are. If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls  you'll see the baby boys just like the girls  gazing into their mother's eyes  you know  needing that relational exchange of energy. When the mother looks away  they could see the dismay on the child  even the boy would cry. They need relationship. So the question is why  as they grow older  does that change  And the answer is patriarchal culture  which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship  to be emotional with someone is girly. That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need  they don't go to doctors if they feel bad. They don't ask for help. There's a quote that I really like   Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'.  You know  his sense of self. Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous. But our  we  is our saving grace  it's what makes us strong. It's not that we're better than men  we just don't have our masculinity to prove. LT  And  well    JF  That's a Gloria Steinem quote. So we can express our humanity    LT  I know who Gloria Steinem is. JF  I know you know who she is  but I think it's a    No  but it's a great quote  I think. We're not better than men  we just don't have our masculinity to prove. And that's really important. LT  But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy. And we've got to make something different happen. JF  Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power. LT  Well  that's what's exciting about this subject. It's because our friendships    female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood  and sisterhood can be a very powerful force  to give the world    to make it what it should be    the things that humans desperately need. PM  It is why we're talking about it  because women's friendships are  as you said  Jane  a renewable source of power. So how do we use that power  JF  Well  women are the fastest growing demographic in the world  especially older women. And if we harness our power  we can change the world. And guess what  We need to. And we need to do it soon. And one of the things that we need to do    and we can do it as women    for one thing  we kind of set the consumer standards. We need to consume less. We in the Western world need to consume less and when we buy things  we need to buy things that are made locally  when we buy food  we need to buy food that's grown locally. We are the ones that need to get off the grid. We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels. And the fossil fuel companies    the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys    cause they are    are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age. You know  that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet  and that's not true. There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine. And they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we're going to be back in the Stone Age  and in fact  if we begin to use renewable energy  and not drill in the Arctic  and not drill    LT  Oh  boy. JF  And not drill in the Alberta tar sands    Right. That we will be    there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well being  and it's women that are going to lead the way. LT  Maybe we have the momentum to start a third wave feminist movement with our sisterhood around the world  with women we don't see  women we may never meet  but we join together that way  because    Aristotle said    most people    people would die without male friendships. And the operative word here was  male.  Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal    JF  They didn't think we had souls even  the Greeks. LT  No  exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was. And wait  no  here's the best part. It's like  you know  men do need women now. The planet needs women. The US Constitution needs women. We are not even in the Constitution. JF  You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment. LT  Right. Justice Ginsberg said something like    every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature  but ours does not. So that would be a good place to start. Very  very mild    JF  Right. And gender equality  it's like a tide  it would lift all boats  not just women. PM  Needing new role models on how to do that. How to be friends  how to think about our power in different ways  as consumers  as citizens of the world  and this is what makes Jane and Lily a role model of how women can be friends    for a very long time  and even if they occasionally disagree. Thank you. Thank you both. JF  Thanks. LT  Thank you. JF  Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Commissioner  thank you for coming to TED. Ant nio Guterres  Pleasure. BG  Let's start with a figure. During       almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries  of course  from Syria and Iraq  but also from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere. And there have been reactions of two different kinds  welcoming parties and border fences. But I want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the long term perspective. And the first question is very simple  Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months  AG  Well  I think  basically  what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group. There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa  from Asia  but slowly growing  and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year. Why  I think there are three reasons  two long term ones and the trigger. The long term ones  in relation to Syrians  is that hope is less and less clear for people. I mean  they look at their own country and they don't see much hope to go back home  because there is no political solution  so there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Second  the living conditions of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating. We just had research with the World Bank  and    percent of the Syrians in Jordan and    percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines. Only half of the children go to school  which means that people are living very badly. Not only are they refugees  out of home  not only have they suffered what they have suffered  but they are living in very  very dramatic conditions. And then the trigger was when all of a sudden  international aid decreased. The World Food Programme was forced  for lack of resources  to cut by    percent food support to the Syrian refugees. They're not allowed to work  so they are totally dependent on international support  and they felt   The world is abandoning us.  And that  in my opinion  was the trigger. All of a sudden  there was a rush  and people started to move in large numbers and  to be absolutely honest  if I had been in the same situation and I would have been brave enough to do it  I think I would have done the same. BG  But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden  but it wasn't supposed to be sudden. The war in Syria has been happening for five years. Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria. You have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya  for example  and yet Europe looked totally unprepared. AG  Well  unprepared because divided  and when you are divided  you don't want to recognize the reality. You prefer to postpone decisions  because you do not have the capacity to make them. And the proof is that even when the spike occurred  Europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation. You talk about one million people. It looks enormous  but the population of the European Union is     million people  which means we are talking about one per every       Europeans. Now  in Lebanon  we have one refugee per three Lebanese. And Lebanon  Struggling  of course  but it's managing. So  the question is  is this something that could have been managed if    not mentioning the most important thing  which would have been addressing the root causes  but forgetting about root causes for now  looking at the phenomenon as it is    if Europe were able to come together in solidarity to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points  But for that  the countries at entry points need to be massively supported  and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms  distributing those that are coming into all European countries  according to the possibilities of each country. I mean  if you look at the relocation program that was approved by the Commission  always too little too late  or by the Council  too little too late    BG  It's already breaking down. AG  My country is supposed to receive four thousand. Four thousand in Portugal means nothing. So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed  but in the present circumstances  the pressure is at the point of entry  and then  as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans  then they come to Germany  Sweden  basically  and Austria. They are the three countries that are  in the end  receiving the refugees. The rest of Europe is looking without doing much. BG  Let me try to bring up three questions  playing a bit devil's advocate. I'll try to ask them  make them blunt. But I think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in Europe right now  The first  of course  is about numbers. You say     million versus one million is not much  but realistically  how many people can Europe take  AG  Well  that is a question that has no answer  because refugees have the right to be protected. And there is such a thing as international law  so there is no way you can say   I take        and that's finished.  I remind you of one thing  in Turkey  at the beginning of the crisis  I remember one minister saying   Turkey will be able to receive up to         people.  Turkey has now two million three hundred thousand or something of the sort  if you count all refugees. So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take. What it is fair to say is  how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities  And Europe has not been able to do so  because basically  Europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the European project. And it's not only about refugees  there are many other areas. And let's be honest  this is the moment in which we need more Europe instead of less Europe. But as the public less and less believes in European institutions  it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more Europe to solve these problems. BG  We seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts  particularly domestically. We saw it again this weekend in France  but we have seen it over and over in many countries  in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere  where the mood changes radically because of the numbers  although they are not very significant in absolute numbers. The Prime Minister of    AG  But  if I may  on these  I mean  what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants  What a European sees is  on television  every single day  a few months ago  opening the news every single day  a crowd coming  uncontrolled  moving from border to border  and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving. And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it    this is happening without any kind of management. And so their idea was   They are coming to my village.  So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change  and everything will    And the problem is that if this had been properly managed  if people had been properly received  welcomed  sheltered at point of entry  screened at point of entry  and the moved by plane to different European countries  this would not have scared people. But  unfortunately  we have a lot of people scared  just because Europe was not able to do the job properly. BG  But there are villages in Germany with     inhabitants and       refugees. So  what's your position  How do you imagine these people reacting  AG  If there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over Europe  you would always have the percentage that I mentioned  one per each      . It is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally impossible to live with  and of course if you have a village    in Lebanon  there are many villages that have more Syrians than Lebanese  Lebanon has been living with that. I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe  for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants. What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly  and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past. BG  So  if you look at the global situation not only at Europe    BG  Yes  BG  If you look at the global situation  so  not only at Europe  I know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up  but I'm more interested in the other part    is there somebody who's doing the right thing  AG  Well     percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world. And if you look at countries like Ethiopia    Ethiopia has received more than         refugees. All the borders in Ethiopia are open. And they have  as a policy  they call the  people to people  policy that every refugee should be received. And they have South Sudanese  they have Sudanese  they have Somalis. They have all the neighbors. They have Eritreans. And  in general  African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming  and I would say that in the Middle East and in Asia  we have seen a tendency for borders to be open. Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation  as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis  but the truth is that for a large period  all borders in the Middle East were open. The truth is that for Afghans  the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for  at the time  six million Afghans that came. So I would say that even today  the trend in the developing world has been for borders to be open. The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become more and more complex  especially when there is  in the public opinion  a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions    in my opinion  misinterpreted    on the other side. BG  We'll come back to that too  but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the World Food Programme. That reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues. Now that the world seems to have woken up  are you getting more funding and more support  or it's still the same  AG  We are getting more support. I would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year. We were much worse during the summer. But that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people and address the needs of the countries that are supporting the people. And here we have a basic review of the criteria  the objectives  the priorities of development cooperation that is required. For instance  Lebanon and Jordan are middle income countries. Because they are middle income countries  they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank. Now  today this doesn't make any sense  because they are providing a global public good. They have millions of refugees there  and to be honest  they are pillars of stability in the region  with all the difficulties they face  and the first line of defense of our collective security. So it doesn't make sense that these countries are not a first priority in development cooperation policies. And they are not. And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries  but the local communities themselves are suffering  because salaries went down  because there are more unemployed  because prices and rents went up. And  of course  if you look at today's situation of the indicators in these countries  it is clear that  especially their poor groups of the population  are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing. BG  Who should be providing this support  Country by country  international organizations  the European Union  Who should be coming up with this support  AG  We need to join all efforts. It's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential. It's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest more massively in support to these countries. We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today  in protracted situations  at a certain moment  that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid or development processes. Because you are talking about children in school  you are talking about health  you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded. You are talking about things that require a long term perspective  a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective. BG  I would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning. It is a statement made by the current front runner for the Republican nomination for US President  Donald Trump. Yesterday  he said this. No  listen to this. It's interesting. I quote   I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US  until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on.  How do you react to that  AG  Well  it's not only Donald Trump. We have seen several people around the world with political responsibility saying  for instance  that Muslims refugees should not be received. And the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this  they are protecting the security of their countries. Now  I've been in government. I am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security of their countries and their people. But if you say  like that  in the US or in any European country   We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees   what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations. Because what you are saying    What you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country  and it will pave the way for the recruitment and the mechanisms that  through technology  Daesh and al Nusra  al Qaeda  and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies. And it's just telling them   You are right  we are against you.  So obviously  this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic  multi religious  multicultural  this is creating a situation in which  really  it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed. BG  Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult  AG  Undoubtedly. BG  In what sense  AG  In the sense that  I mean  for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is  close all borders    not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown. We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq  so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in. And I must say  I am convinced that the passport that appeared  I believe  was put by the person who has blown    BG     himself up  yeah. AG   I believe  it was on purpose  because part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees  because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders. And I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react  closing its doors to Muslim refugees and having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe  exactly to facilitate Daesh's work. And my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism. I think  as I said  essentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement in relation to the global situation that we are facing  and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong  by welcoming and integrating effectively those that are coming from that part of the world. And another thing that I believe is that to a large extent  what we are today paying for in Europe is the failures of integration models that didn't work in the '  s  in the '  s  in the '  s  in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people  for instance  of the second generation of communities  a situation of feeling marginalized  having no jobs  having improper education  living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure. And this kind of uneasiness  sometimes even anger  that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies  to the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other. For me it is clear. For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic  multicultural  multi religious in the future. To try to avoid it is  in my opinion  impossible. And for me it's a good thing that they will be like that  but I also recognize that  for that to work properly  you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies. And Europe  to a large extent  failed in that investment in the past few decades. BG  Question  You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year  after    years. If you look back at       when you entered that office for the first time  what do you see  AG  Well  look  In       we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity  because conflicts had ended. Last year  we helped        . In       we had about    million people displaced by conflict in the world. Today  we have more than    million. At that time  we had had  recently  some conflicts that were solved. Now  we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died  Afghanistan  Somalia  Democratic Republic of Congo. It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was. It is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them  is  unfortunately  much worse than what it was    years ago. There are no clear power relations in the world  no global governance mechanisms that work  which means that we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail  and that means that more and more people suffer  namely those that are displaced by conflicts. BG  It's a tradition in American politics that when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time  he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later. If you had to write such a note to your successor  Filippo Grandi  what would you write  AG  Well  I don't think I would write any message. You know  one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver  always telling the new one what to do. So that  I will not do. If I had to say something to him  it would be   Be yourself  and do your best.  BG  Commissioner  thank you for the job you do. Thank you for coming to TED. In       Burhan Hassan  age     boarded a flight from Minneapolis to the Horn of Africa. And while Burhan was the youngest recruit  he was not alone. Al Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men in their late teens and early   s with a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook. With the Internet and other technologies  they've changed our everyday lives  but they've also changed recruitment  radicalization and the front lines of conflict today. What about the links connecting Twitter  Google and protesters fighting for democracy  These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers  effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other  to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening in their own country. Today  conflict is essentially borderless. If there are bounds to conflict today  they're bound by digital  not physical geography. And under all this is a vacuum of power where non state actors  individuals and private organizations have the advantage over slow  outdated military and intelligence agencies. And this is because  in the digital age of conflict  there exists a feedback loop where new technologies  platforms like the ones I mentioned  and more disruptive ones  can be adapted  learned  and deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react. To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this  I like to turn to something aptly named the Worldwide Threat Assessment  where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US looks at the global threat landscape  and he says   These are the threats  these are the details  and this is how we rank them.  In       there was absolutely no mention of cyber security. It took until       when it came at the end  where other things  like West African drug trafficking  took precedence. In       it crept up  still behind things like terrorism and proliferation. In       it became the top threat  in      and for the foreseeable future. What things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict  where conflict can be immaterial  borderless  often wholly untraceable. And conflict isn't just online to offline  as we see with terrorist radicalization  but it goes the other way as well. We all know the horrible events that unfolded in Paris this year with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks. What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in.  JeSuisCharlie. On Facebook  on Twitter  on Google  all sorts of places where millions of people  myself included  were talking about the events and saw images like this  the emotional  poignant image of a baby with  Je suis Charlie  on its wrist. And this turned into a weapon. What the hackers did was weaponize this image  where unsuspecting victims  like all of us in those conversations  saw this image  downloaded it but it was embedded with malware. And so when you downloaded this image  it hacked your system. It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign. The divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist  where we have offline attacks like those in Paris appropriated for online hacks. And it goes the other way as well  with recruitment. We see online radicalization of teens  who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks. With all of this  we see that there's a new   st century battle brewing  and governments don't necessarily take a part. So in another case  Anonymous vs. Los Zetas. In early September      in Mexico  Los Zetas  one of the most powerful drug cartels  hung two bloggers with a sign that said   This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies.  A week later  they beheaded a young girl. They severed her head  put it on top of her computer with a similar note. And taking the digital counteroffensive because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act  Anonymous  a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world  took action  not in cyber attacks  but threatening information to be free. On social media  they said   We will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel.  And escalating that conflict  Los Zetas said   We will kill    people for every bit of information you release.  And so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue. But what was powerful about this was that anonymous individuals  not federal policia  not military  not politicians  could strike fear deep into the heart of one of the most powerful  violent organizations in the world. And so we live in an era that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict  in who we're fighting  in the motivations behind attacks  in the tools and techniques used  and how quickly they evolve. And the question still remains  what can individuals  organizations and governments do  For answers to these questions  it starts with individuals  and I think peer to peer security is the answer. Those people in relationships that bought over teens online  we can do that with peer to peer security. Individuals have more power than ever before to affect national and international security. And we can create those positive peer to peer relationships on and offline  we can support and educate the next generation of hackers  like myself  instead of saying   You can either be a criminal or join the NSA.  That matters today. And it's not just individuals    it's organizations  corporations even. They have an advantage to act across more borders  more effectively and more rapidly than governments can  and there's a set of real incentives there. It's profitable and valuable to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age  and will only be more so in future generations to come. But we still can't ignore government  because that's who we turn to for collective action to keep us safe and secure. But we see where that's gotten us so far  where there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict  where at the highest levels of leadership  the Director of the CIA  Secretary of Defense  they say   Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen.   Cyber      is imminent.  But this only makes us more fearful  not more secure. By banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking  sure  GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you. But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can. Capabilities are cheap  even free. Technical ability is rising around the world  and individuals and small groups have the advantage. So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ  but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor  Or in another generation  some kid in his basement in Estonia  And so I would say that it's not what governments can do  it's that they can't. Governments today need to give up power and control in order to help make us more secure. Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that  yeah  they can't spy on us  but neither can the Chinese or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now. And government support for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin mean giving up control  but it means that developers  translators  anybody with an Internet connection  in countries like Cuba  Iran and China  can sell their skills  their products  in the global marketplace  but more importantly sell their ideas  show us what's happening in their own countries. And so it should be not fearful  it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights  free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century  that today  for the first time in human history  we have a technical opportunity to make billions of people safer around the world that we've never had before in human history. It should be inspiring. Ten years ago  I had my first exhibition here. I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible  but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve  I made my first sculpture  called  The Lost Correspondent.  Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center  I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada  in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan. And then this incredible thing happened. It transformed. One sculpture became two. Two quickly became   . And before I knew it  we had the world's first underwater sculpture park. In       I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman. This grew to a small community  to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea. And then finally  to an underwater museum  with over     living sculptures. Gardening  it seems  is not just for greenhouses. We've since scaled up the designs   Ocean Atlas   in the Bahamas  rising    feet up to the surface and weighing over    tons  to now currently in Lanzarote  where I'm making an underwater botanical garden  the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean. Each project  we use materials and designs that help encourage life  a long lasting pH neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform. It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach. We position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning  there's areas for them to settle. The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale. Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins. So why exhibit my work in the ocean  Because honestly  it's really not easy. When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred foot crane  trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor  you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead. But in the end  the results always blow my mind. The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for. You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour  explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery  a unique timeless quality and the procession of inquisitive visitors  each lending their own special touch to the site. But over the years  I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do  the really humbling thing about the work  is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures  they're not ours anymore  because as soon as we sink them  the sculptures  they belong to the sea. As new reefs form  a new world literally starts to evolve  a world that continuously amazes me. It's a bit of a clich   but nothing man made can ever match the imagination of nature. Sponges look like veins across the faces. Staghorn coral morphs the form. Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed. Tunicates explode from the faces. Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night. Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint. The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater. Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves. Purple sponges breathe water like air. And grey angelfish glide silently overhead. And the amazing response we've had to these works tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal  because it seems that these images translate across the world  and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what I'm trying to achieve. I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean  and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really  really important effect of my work. Because as we all know  our reefs are dying  and our oceans are in trouble. So here's the thing  the most used  searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this. And I think this is for a reason  or at least I hope it is. What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature  that we need to start thinking about our oceans  too. Since building these sites  we've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results. Besides creating over     square meters of new habitats and living reef  visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs  providing significant rest for natural  overstressed areas. Visitors to  Ocean Atlas  in the Bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery. The subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge    million dollars in coastal cleanups. The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot    a marine protected area. Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas. The site was actually listed as a  Wonder of the World  by National Geographic. So why are we all here today in this room  What do we all have in common  I think we all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough. And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred  and we should. When we see incredible places    like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Fam lia  or the Mona Lisa  even    when we see these incredible places and things  we understand their importance. We call them sacred  and we do our best to cherish them  to protect them and to keep them safe. But in order to do that  we are the ones that have to assign that value  otherwise  it will be desecrated by someone who doesn't understand that value. So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things. When we were naming the site in Cancun  we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason  museums are places of preservation  of conservation and of education. They're places where we keep objects of great value to us  where we simply treasure them for them being themselves. If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel  we'd all go crazy. If someone wanted to build a seven star hotel at the bottom of the Grand Canyon  then we would laugh them out of Arizona. Yet every day we dredge  pollute and overfish our oceans. And I think it's easier for us to do that  because when we see the ocean  we don't see the havoc we're wreaking. Because for most people  the ocean is like this. And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous  as fragile. It's simply too massive  too vast  too endless. And what do you see here  I think most people actually look past to the horizon. So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea  and if we don't really see it  if it doesn't have its own iconography  if we miss its majesty  then there's a big danger that we take it for granted. Cancun is famous for spring break  tequila and foam parties. And its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis and banana boats. But because of our work there  there's now a little corner of Cancun that is simply precious for being itself. And we don't want to stop in Grenada  in Cancun or the Bahamas. Just last month  I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Thames River  in central London  right in front of the Houses of Parliament  putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things. Because for me  this is just the beginning of the mission. We want to team up with other inventors  creators  philanthropists  educators  biologists  to see better futures for our oceans. And we want to see beyond sculpture  beyond art  even. Say you're a    year old kid from the city  and you've never seen the ocean. And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium  you get taken out to the ocean  to an underwater Noah's Ark  which you can access through a dry glass viewing tunnel  where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean. Clearly  it would blow your mind. So let's think big and let's think deep. Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us  I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean  that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting  but that we are also giving something back  and by encouraging new environments to thrive  and in some way opening up a new    or maybe it's a really old way of seeing the seas  as delicate  precious places  worthy of our protection. Our oceans are sacred. Thank you. What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life  If you were going to invest now in your future best self  where would you put your time and your energy  There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were  and over    percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. And another    percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. And we're constantly told to lean in to work  to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives  of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them  those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past  and as we know  hindsight is anything but      . We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life  and sometimes memory is downright creative. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time  What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy  We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For    years  we've tracked the lives of     men  year after year  asking about their work  their home lives  their health  and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study  or funding for the research dries up  or the researchers get distracted  or they die  and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers  this study has survived. About    of our original     men are still alive  still participating in the study  most of them in their   s. And we are now beginning to study the more than       children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since       we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II  and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods  boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the     s. Most lived in tenements  many without hot and cold running water. When they entered the study  all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors  one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top  and some made that journey in the opposite direction. The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today     years later  telling you that the study still continues. Every two years  our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. Many of the inner city Boston men ask us   Why do you keep wanting to study me  My life just isn't that interesting.  The Harvard men never ask that question. To get the clearest picture of these lives  we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood  we scan their brains  we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when  about a decade ago  we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study  many of the women said   You know  it's about time.  So what have we learned  What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives  Well  the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this    year study is this  Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period. We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us  and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family  to friends  to community  are happier  they're physically healthier  and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy  their health declines earlier in midlife  their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time  more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage  so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have  and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship  but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High conflict marriages  for example  without much affection  turn out to be very bad for our health  perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good  warm relationships is protective. Once we had followed our men all the way into their   s  we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy  healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age     it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age    were the healthiest at age   . And good  close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported  in their   s  that on the days when they had more physical pain  their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships  on the days when they reported more physical pain  it was magnified by more emotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies  they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your   s is protective  that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need  those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one  those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships  they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out  but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough  those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. So this message  that good  close relationships are good for our health and well being  this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore  Well  we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix  something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends  it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our    year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey  many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over  over these    years  our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships  with family  with friends  with community. So what about you  Let's say you're     or you're     or you're   . What might leaning in to relationships even look like  Well  the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together  long walks or date nights  or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years  because those all too common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago  he was looking back on his life  and he wrote this   There isn't time  so brief is life  for bickerings  apologies  heartburnings  callings to account. There is only time for loving  and but an instant  so to speak  for that.  The good life is built with good relationships. Thank you.
