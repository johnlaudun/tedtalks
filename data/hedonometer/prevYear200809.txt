I am very  very happy to be amidst some of the most    the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses. I am very happy and honored to be amidst very  very innovative and intelligent people. I have listened to the three previous speakers  and guess what happened  Every single thing I planned to say  they have said it here  and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say. But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something  that bud is a young one. So  I will    since I am not young and am very old  I still will say something. We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment  because another conference is taking place in Berlin. It is the G  Summit. The G  Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid  something akin to the Marshall Plan. Unfortunately  I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan. One  because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. Its largest recipients were Germany and France  and it was only  .  percent of their GDP. An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of        percent of its GDP  and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries. But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. How the media covers Africa in the West  and the consequences of that. By displaying despair  helplessness and hopelessness  the media is telling the truth about Africa  and nothing but the truth. However  the media is not telling us the whole truth. Because despair  civil war  hunger and famine  although they're part and parcel of our African reality  they are not the only reality. And secondly  they are the smallest reality. Africa has    nations. We have civil wars only in six countries  which means that the media are covering only six countries. Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience. But the effect of that presentation is  it appeals to sympathy. It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity. And  as a consequence  the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly. The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair. What should we do with it  We should give food to the hungry. We should deliver medicines to those who are ill. We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. And in the process  Africa has been stripped of self initiative. I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses. But equally  it has opportunities and a lot of potential. We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa  from a challenge of despair  which is called poverty reduction  to a challenge of hope. We frame it as a challenge of hope  and that is worth creation. The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty. It should be a challenge of creating wealth. Once we change those two things    if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction  you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent  with what  Medicines for the poor  food relief for those who are hungry  and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war. And in the process  none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms  not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems. Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines  ladies and gentlemen  does not create wealth for them. Wealth is a function of income  and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well paying job. Now  once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa  our second challenge will be  who are the wealth creating agents in any society  They are entrepreneurs.  Unclear  told us they are always about four percent of the population  but    percent are imitators. But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship. So  where should we be putting the money  We need to put money where it can productively grow. Support private investment in Africa  both domestic and foreign. Support research institutions  because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation. But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today  They are throwing large sums of money for primary health  for primary education  for food relief. The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair  in need of charity. Ladies and gentlemen  can any one of you tell me a neighbor  a friend  a relative that you know  who became rich by receiving charity  By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms  Does any one of you in the audience have that person  Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another  Well  since I'm not seeing the hand  it appears that what I'm stating is true. Andrew Mwenda  I can see Bono says he knows the country. Which country is that  AM  Thank you very much. But let me tell you this. External actors can only present to you an opportunity. The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity. Africa has received many opportunities. Many of them we haven't benefited much. Why  Because we lack the internal  institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example. Under the Cotonou Agreement  formerly known as the Lome Convention  African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods  duty free  to the European Union market. My own country  Uganda  has a quota to export        metric tons of sugar to the European Union market. We haven't exported one kilogram yet. We import        metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba. Secondly  under the beef protocol of that agreement  African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty free to the European Union market. None of those countries  including Africa's most successful nation  Botswana  has ever met its quota. So  I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework. And all forms of intervention need support  the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth  the kinds of institutions that increase productivity. How do we begin to do that  and why is aid the bad instrument  Aid is the bad instrument  and do you know why  Because all governments across the world need money to survive. Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order. You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order. And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial  they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers on. Why should people support their government  Well  because it gives them good  paying jobs  or  in many African countries  unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption. The fact is no government in the world  with the exception of a few  like that of Idi Amin  can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule. Many countries in the  unclear   they need legitimacy. To get legitimacy  governments often need to deliver things like primary education  primary health  roads  build hospitals and clinics. If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people  such a government is driven by self interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion. It will sit with those who create wealth. Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them. The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa. The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy  it lies with international donors. Rather than sit with Ugandan    rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs  Ghanaian businessmen  South African enterprising leaders  our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank. I can tell you  even if you have ten Ph.Ds.  you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry. Why  Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business    it requires that you listen to the people  the private sector actors in that industry. Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity  by the international community  to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens  and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank  and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need. In the process  we  the African people  have been sidelined from the policy making  policy orientation  and policy  implementation process in our countries. We have limited input  because he who pays the piper calls the tune. The IMF  the World Bank  and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens  and therefore what our governments are doing  because they depend on aid  is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens. But I want to put a caveat on my argument  and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Some aid may have built a hospital  fed a hungry village. It may have built a road  and that road may have served a very good role. The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success  generalize them  pour billions and trillions of dollars into them  and then spread them across the whole world  ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village  the skills  the practices  the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed    like in Sauri village  in Kenya  where Jeffrey Sachs is working    and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody. Aid increases the resources available to governments  and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have  as a person in Africa seeking a career. By increasing the political attractiveness of the state  especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa  aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie. Ladies and gentlemen  the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business. Governments are not changing it. Why  Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens. They talk to international donors. So  the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government  and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid. I also want to say that it is important for us to note that  over the last    years  Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community  in the form of technical assistance  and financial aid  and all other forms of aid. Between      and       our continent received     billion dollars of aid  and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa. Where has all the aid gone  I want to use the example of my own country  called Uganda  and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there. In the           budget  expected revenue   .  trillion shillings. The expected foreign aid   .  trillion. Uganda's recurrent expenditure    by recurrent what do I mean  Hand to mouth is  .  trillion. Why does the government of Uganda budget spend     percent of its own revenue  It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid  who contributes for it. But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments  but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure. Public administration  which is largely patronage  takes     billion. The military      billion. Agriculture  which employs    percent of our poverty stricken citizens  takes only    billion. Trade and industry takes    billion. And let me show you  what does public expenditure    rather  public administration expenditure    in Uganda constitute  There you go.    cabinet ministers      presidential advisers  by the way  who never see the president  except on television. And when they see him physically  it is at public functions like this  and even there  it is him who advises them. We have    units of local government. Each local government is organized like the central government    a bureaucracy  a cabinet  a parliament  and so many jobs for the political hangers on. There were     and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits  he had to create    new districts  and now there are   . Three hundred thirty three members of parliament. You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament. One hundred thirty four commissions and semi autonomous government bodies  all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing  this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work  he may help us on this. A recent government of Uganda study found that there are       four wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters. Uganda has     sub counties  each of them with a dispensary  none of which has an ambulance. So  the four wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers  the permanent secretaries  the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects  while the poor die without ambulances and medicine. Finally  I want to say that before I came to speak here  I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt. It should be short enough to arouse interest  but long enough to cover the subject. I hope I have achieved that. Thank you very much. I would like to tell you about a project which I started about    years ago. It's about making new forms of life. And these are made of this kind of tube    electricity tube  we call it in Holland. And we can start a film about that  and we can see a little bit backwards in time. Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution. Theo Jansen  I want to put these forms of life on the beaches. And they should survive over there  on their own  in the future. Learning to live on their own    and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own. Narrator  The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food  but from the wind. The wind will move feathers on their back  which will drive their feet. The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach  with its nose pointed into the wind. As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand  it stops  and walks in the opposite direction. Evolution has generated many species. This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa. TJ  This is a herd  and it is built according to genetic codes. And it is a sort of race  and each and every animal is different  and the winning codes will multiply. This is the wave  going from left to right. You can see this one. Yes  and now it goes from left to right. This is a new generation  a new family  which is able to store the wind. So  the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles  which are on top of that. And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away  and the tide is coming up  and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives  because they are drowned very easily. I could show you this animal. Thank you. So  the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking. There are    numbers  which I call The    Holy Numbers. These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way. In fact  it's a new invention of the wheel. It works the same as a wheel. The axis of a wheel stays on the same level  and this hip is staying on the same level as well. In fact  this is better than a wheel  because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach  you will notice it's very hard to do. And the feet just step over the sand  and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between. So       years after the invention of the wheel  we have a new wheel. I will show you  in the next video    can you start it  please     that very heavy loads can be moved. There's a guy pushing there  behind  but it can also walk on the wind very well. It's  .  tons. This is working on the stored wind in the bottles. It has a feeler  where it can feel obstacles and turn around. You see  it's going the other way. Can I have the feeler here  OK. Good. So  they have to survive all the dangers of the beach  and one of the big dangers is the sea. This is the sea. And it must feel the water of the sea. And this is the water feeler  and what's very important is this tube. It sucks in air normally  but when it swallows water  it feels the resistance of it. So  imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea. As soon as it touches the water    you should hear a sound of running air. Yes  So if it doesn't feel  it will be drowned  OK  Here we have the brain of the animal. In fact  it is a step counter  and it counts the steps. It's a binary step counter. So as soon it has been to the sea  it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here. And it always knows where it is on the beach. So it's very simple brain. It says  well  there's the sea  there are dunes  and I'm here. So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal. Thank you. One of the biggest enemies are the storms. This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere. When the nose of the animal is fixed  the whole animal is fixed. So when the storm is coming up  it drives a pin into the ground. Audience member  Wow  The nose is fixed  the whole animal is fixed. The wind may turn  but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind. Now  another couple of years  and these animals will survive on their own. I still have to help them a lot. Thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen. This is a picture of Maurice Druon  the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise  the French Academy. He is splendidly attired in his        dollar uniform  befitting the role of the French Academy as legislating the correct usage in French and perpetuating the language. The French Academy has two main tasks  it compiles a dictionary of official French. They're now working on their ninth edition  which they began in       and they've reached the letter P. They also legislate on correct usage  such as the proper term for what the French call  email   which ought to be  courriel.  The World Wide Web  the French are told  ought to be referred to as  la toile d'araignee mondiale     the Global Spider Web    recommendations that the French gaily ignore. Now  this is one model of how language comes to be  namely  it's legislated by an academy. But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit  that language  rather  emerges from human minds interacting from one another. And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language    the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary  it will already be well out of date. We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon  of the historical change in languages  in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages. So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature  so much as a window onto human nature. In a book that I'm currently working on  I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature  including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction. And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning. Let me start off with a technical problem in language that I've worried about for quite some time    and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used. The problem is  which verbs go in which constructions  The verb is the chassis of the sentence. It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted. Let me give you a quick reminder of something that you've long forgotten. An intransitive verb  such as  dine   for example  can't take a direct object. You have to say   Sam dined   not   Sam dined the pizza.  A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there   Sam devoured the pizza.  You can't just say   Sam devoured.  There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type  each of which shapes its sentence. So  a problem in explaining how children learn language  a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors  and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions. For example  the dative construction in English. You can say   Give a muffin to a mouse   the prepositional dative. Or   Give a mouse a muffin   the double object dative.  Promise anything to her    Promise her anything   and so on. Hundreds of verbs can go both ways. So a tempting generalization for a child  for an adult  for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction   subject verb thing to a recipient  can also be expressed as  subject verb recipient thing.  A handy thing to have  because language is infinite  and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard. You've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences. This would be an example of how to do that. Unfortunately  there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions. You can say   Biff drove the car to Chicago   but not   Biff drove Chicago the car.  You can say   Sal gave Jason a headache   but it's a bit odd to say   Sal gave a headache to Jason.  The solution is that these constructions  despite initial appearance  are not synonymous  that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition  you see that there's a subtle difference in meaning between them. So   give the X to the Y   that construction corresponds to the thought  cause X to go to Y.  Whereas  give the Y the X  corresponds to the thought  cause Y to have X.  Now  many events can be subject to either construal  kind of like the classic figure ground reversal illusions  in which you can either pay attention to the particular object  in which case the space around it recedes from attention  or you can see the faces in the empty space  in which case the object recedes out of consciousness. How are these construals reflected in language  Well  in both cases  the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object  the noun after the verb. So  when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere    where you're doing something to the muffin    you say   Give the muffin to the mouse.  When you construe it as  cause the mouse to have something   you're doing something to the mouse  and therefore you express it as   Give the mouse the muffin.  So which verbs go in which construction    the problem with which I began    depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change. To give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have. To drive the car only causes something to go  because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something. Only humans can possess things. And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache  but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person  and implanting it in them. You may just be loud or obnoxious  or some other way causing them to have the headache. So  that's an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job. So why should anyone care  Well  there are a number of interesting conclusions  I think  from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of English verbs. First  there's a level of fine grained conceptual structure  which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence  that governs our use of language. You can think of this as the language of thought  or  mentalese.  It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts  which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs    not only in English  but in all other languages    fundamental concepts such as space  time  causation and human intention  such as  what is the means and what is the ends  These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that Immanuel Kant argued are the basic framework for human thought  and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these Kantian categories. Doesn't care about perceptual qualities  such as color  texture  weight and speed  which virtually never differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions. An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English are used not only literally  but in a quasi metaphorical way. For example  this construction  the dative  is used not only to transfer things  but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas  as when we say   She told a story to me  or  told me a story    Max taught Spanish to the students  or  taught the students Spanish.  It's exactly the same construction  but no muffins  no mice  nothing moving at all. It evokes the container metaphor of communication  in which we conceive of ideas as objects  sentences as containers  and communication as a kind of sending. As when we say we  gather  our ideas  to  put  them  into  words  and if our words aren't  empty  or  hollow   we might get these ideas  across  to a listener  who can  unpack  our words to  extract  their  content.  And indeed  this kind of verbiage is not the exception  but the rule. It's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor. For example  you can use the verb  go  and the prepositions  to  and  from  in a literal  spatial sense.  The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.  You can also say   Biff went from sick to well.  He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time  but it's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving. Or   The meeting went from three to four   in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line. Likewise  we use  force  to indicate not only physical force  as in   Rose forced the door to open   but also interpersonal force  as in   Rose forced Sadie to go   not necessarily by manhandling her  but by issuing a threat. Or   Rose forced herself to go   as if there were two entities inside Rose's head  engaged in a tug of a war. Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways  such as  cause something to go to someone  and  causing someone to have something   I think is a fundamental feature of human thought  and it's the basis for much human argumentation  in which people don't differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed. Just to give you a few examples   ending a pregnancy  versus  killing a fetus    a ball of cells  versus  an unborn child    invading Iraq  versus  liberating Iraq    redistributing wealth  versus  confiscating earnings.  And I think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts    such as objects  space  time  causation and intention    which are useful in a social  knowledge intensive species  whose evolution you can well imagine  and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content    space  time and force    and apply them to new abstract domains  therefore allowing a species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals  to conceptualize mathematics  physics  law and other abstract domains. Well  I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature    the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world  and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction  again  as reflected in language. And I'll start out with a puzzle  the puzzle of indirect speech acts. Now  I'm sure most of you have seen the movie  Fargo.  And you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer  is asked to show his driver's license and holds his wallet out with a    dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet. And he says   I was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo   which everyone  including the audience  interprets as a veiled bribe. This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language. For example  in polite requests  if someone says   If you could pass the guacamole  that would be awesome   we know exactly what he means  even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed.  Would you like to come up and see my etchings   I think most people understand the intent behind that. And likewise  if someone says   Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it     we understand that as a veiled threat  rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities. So the puzzle is  why are bribes  polite requests  solicitations and threats so often veiled  No one's fooled. Both parties know exactly what the speaker means  and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows  etc.  etc. So what's going on  I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships  and human relationships fall into a number of types. There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske  in which relationships can be categorized  more or less  into communality  which works on the principle  what's mine is thine  what's thine is mine   the kind of mindset that operates within a family  for example  dominance  whose principle is  don't mess with me   reciprocity   you scratch my back  I'll scratch yours   and sexuality  in the immortal words of Cole Porter   Let's do it.  Now  relationship types can be negotiated. Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied  they can be stretched and extended. For example  communality applies most naturally within family or friends  but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it. For example  in brotherhoods  fraternal organizations  sororities  locutions like  the family of man   you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin. Now  mismatches    when one person assumes one relationship type  and another assumes a different one    can be awkward. If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate  for example  that would be an awkward situation. Or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal  that would be rather awkward as well. In less blatant cases  there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on. In the workplace  for example  there's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss  or refer to him or her on a first name basis. If two friends have a reciprocal transaction  like selling a car  it's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness. In dating  the transition from friendship to sex can lead to  notoriously  various forms of awkwardness  and as can sex in the workplace  in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship  sexual harassment.  Well  what does this have to do with language  Well  language  as a social interaction  has to satisfy two conditions. You have to convey the actual content    here we get back to the container metaphor. You want to express the bribe  the command  the promise  the solicitation and so on  but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person. The solution  I think  is that we use language at two levels  the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener  whereas the implicated content    the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform    allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context  which possibly initiates a changed relationship. The simplest example of this is in the polite request. If you express your request as a conditional     if you could open the window  that would be great     even though the content is an imperative  the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance  where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person. On the other hand  you want the damn guacamole. By expressing it as an if then statement  you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around. And in a more subtle way  I think  this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability  the bribes  threats  propositions  solicitations and so on. One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language    where it could only be used literally. And you can think of it in terms of a game theoretic payoff matrix. Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer. There's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer. If you don't bribe the officer  then you will get a traffic ticket    or  as is the case of  Fargo   worse    whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest. Nothing ventured  nothing gained. In that case  the consequences are rather severe. On the other hand  if you extend the bribe  if the officer is dishonest  you get a huge payoff of going free. If the officer is honest  you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery. So this is a rather fraught situation. On the other hand  with indirect language  if you issue a veiled bribe  then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe  in which case you get the payoff of going free. The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe  and therefore  you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket. So you get the best of both worlds. And a similar analysis  I think  can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation  and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset. I think this affirms something that's long been known by diplomats    namely  that the vagueness of language  far from being a bug or an imperfection  actually might be a feature of language  one that we use to our advantage in social interactions. So to sum up  language is a collective human creation  reflecting human nature  how we conceptualize reality  how we relate to one another. And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language  I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick. Thank you very much. Images like this  from the Auschwitz concentration camp  have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are  where we've come from and the times we live in. During the twentieth century  we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin  Hitler  Mao  Pol Pot  Rwanda and other genocides  and even though the twenty first century is only seven years old  we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq. This has led to a common understanding of our situation  namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence  and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from  to our peril. Here is an example from an op ed on Thanksgiving  in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago  where the writer wrote   The Indian life was a difficult one  but there were no employment problems  community harmony was strong  substance abuse unknown  crime nearly non existent  what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter.  Now  you're all familiar with this treacle. We teach it to our children. We hear it on television and in storybooks. Now  the original title of this session was   Everything You Know Is Wrong   and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong  that  in fact  our ancestors were far more violent than we are  that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time  and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. Now  in the decade of Darfur and Iraq  a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia  over centuries  over decades and over years  although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it all over the world  although not homogeneously. It's especially evident in the West  beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment. Let me take you on a journey of several powers of       from the millennium scale to the year scale    to try to persuade you of this. Until        years ago  all humans lived as hunter gatherers  without permanent settlements or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley  looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter gatherers  which is our best source of evidence about this way of life  has shown a rather different conclusion. Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging  or hunting and gathering societies. The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man  as opposed to passing away of natural causes  in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest. And they range from a rate of almost a    percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to  in the case of the Gebusi  only a    percent chance. The tiny  little blue bar in the lower left hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century  and includes all the deaths of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the   th century  there would have been two billion deaths rather than     million. Also at the millennium scale  we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values  one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare  such as the following from Numbers      And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses  and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them  'Have you saved all the women alive  Now  therefore  kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him  but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'  In other words  kill the men  kill the children  if you see any virgins  then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them. You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk. Also in the Bible  one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality  adultery  blasphemy  idolatry  talking back to your parents    Well  let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude  and look at the century scale. Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times  we know just from conventional history    the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence. For example  any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine  in those days would result in your tongue being cut out  your ears being cut off  you being blinded  a hand being chopped off and so on. There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment  burning at the stake  disemboweling  breaking on the wheel  being pulled apart by horses and so on. The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non violent crimes  criticizing the king  stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery  of course  was the preferred labor saving device  and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning  in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire  and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat  howling in pain  was burned to death. What about one on one murder  Well  there  there are good statistics  because many municipalities recorded the cause of death. The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village  hamlet  town  county that he could find  and he supplemented them with national data  when nations started keeping statistics. He plotted on a logarithmic scale  going from     deaths per         people per year  which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per         people per year in seven or eight European countries. Then  there is a slight uptick in the     s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that. But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present  and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century. Let's click down now to the decade scale. According to non governmental organizations that keep such statistics  since       in Europe and the Americas  there has been a steep decline in interstate wars  in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms  and in military coups  even in South America. Worldwide  there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from      to the present. And  as you can see  the death rate goes down from        deaths per conflict per year in the     s to less than       deaths per conflict per year in this decade  as horrific as it is. Even in the year scale  one can see a decline of violence. Since the end of the Cold War  there have been fewer civil wars  fewer genocides    indeed  a    percent reduction since post World War II highs    and even a reversal of the     s uptick in homicide and violent crime. This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '  s and the '  s  then it soared upward for several decades  and began a precipitous decline  starting in the     s  so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in     . President Clinton  if you're here  thank you. So the question is  why are so many people so wrong about something so important  I think there are a number of reasons. One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth century monks were. There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something  the higher the probability that you assign to it. Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets  no one ever attracted observers  advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better. There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life  and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture. And of course  our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time. That's a process that seems to be continuing  but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day  things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards. So today  we get exercised    and rightly so    if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a    year appeal process. We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago  they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted    minutes  and indeed  that that would have been repeated over and over again. Today  we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink  rather than how high our standards have risen. Well  why has violence declined  No one really knows  but I have read four explanations  all of which  I think  have some grain of plausibility. The first is  maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was  solitary  poor  nasty  brutish and short.  Not because  he argued  humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative  but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy  there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively  before they invade you. More recently  Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement. Being a good American  he has a pistol in the nightstand  pulls out his gun  and walks down the stairs. And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand. Now  each one of them is thinking   I don't really want to kill that guy  but he's about to kill me. Maybe I had better shoot him  before he shoots me  especially since  even if he doesn't want to kill me  he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me.  And so on. Hunter gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought  and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first. Now  one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence. You don't strike first  but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded. The only thing is that it's liable to having its bluff called  and therefore can only work if it's credible. To make it credible  you must avenge all insults and settle all scores  which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta. Life becomes an episode of  The Sopranos.  Hobbes' solution  the  Leviathan   was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency    a leviathan    then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack  because any kind of aggression will be punished  leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively  out of fear of them attacking you first. It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore  it would lead to a state of peace. Eisner    the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide    argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states. So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory. Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy  in failed states  collapsed empires  frontier regions  mafias  street gangs and so on. The second explanation is that in many times and places  there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap. In earlier times  when suffering and early death were common in one's own life  one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant  one puts a higher value on life in general. This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne. A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero sum game  and was worked out in the book  Nonzero  by the journalist Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances  cooperation or non violence can benefit both parties in an interaction  such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead  or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time. Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in  by allowing the trade of goods  services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people. The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead  and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it   Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini van.  The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called  The Expanding Circle   by the philosopher Peter Singer  who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy  an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately  by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family. People outside that circle are treated as sub human  and can be exploited with impunity. But  over history  the circle has expanded. One can see  in historical record  it expanding from the village  to the clan  to the tribe  to the nation  to other races  to both sexes  and  in Singer's own arguments  something that we should extend to other sentient species. The question is  if this has happened  what has powered that expansion  And there are a number of possibilities  such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for. The logic of the golden rule    the more you think about and interact with other people  the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs  at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say that my interests are special compared to yours  anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute. It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism  by histories  and journalism  and memoirs  and realistic fiction  and travel  and literacy  which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub human  and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life  the sense that  there but for fortune go I.  Whatever its causes  the decline of violence  I think  has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just  why is there war  But also  why is there peace  Not just  what are we doing wrong  But also  what have we been doing right  Because we have been doing something right  and it sure would be good to find out what it is. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of    that you were talking about  that Peter Singer talks about  is also driven by  just by technology  by greater visibility of the other  and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller. I mean  is that also a grain of truth  Steven Pinker  Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory  that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles. But also  I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages  you think  how could they possibly have done it  how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling  But clearly  as far as they're concerned  this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything  I think  that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person. CA  Well  Steve  I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much. SP  My pleasure. Three years ago  I got a phone call  based on an earlier film I had made  with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard. My idea    and literally  I woke up in the middle of the night  and we've all have those moments. You know  you go to sleep    I was excited  with this phone call. I was thinking  I just finished making another film about World War II vets  and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories  and I realized this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded. So I went to bed that night pretty excited. Not sure of all the details  but excited. It wasn't at four in the morning  but it was closer to midnight. Woke straight up. Wide awake as could be. And I had this idea  what if I could  in effect  virtually embed  and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers  To tell the story from the inside out  versus the outside in  So  I called back Major Heilshorn  who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard. And he knew me  so I was like   Greg   He's like   Yes  Deborah   Told him my idea  and you know  he is one of the bravest men in the world  as is General Blair  who  in the end  gave me permission to try this experiment. Within    days  I was down at Fort Dix. He gave me my pick of units. I picked one unit    Charlie Company  Third of the    nd  they're mountain infantry    for two reasons. One  they're infantry. Number two  they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda  so I knew they would have Internet access. The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer. This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me  I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean. So what that meant was  when I went down to Fort Dix  I had to hop out in front of     guys and tell them of my vision. You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got. The opening one was   What the fuck do you know about the National Guard   I started with the      Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars. Gave them about a nine minute response  and there we went. So  I'd like to show the clip of the film. It's our trailer  because I know  obviously you guys are busy  many of you may not have had a chance to see it. So  I want to show the trailer  and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail. If we could roll  Michael Moriarty  Specialist Michael Moriarty. Zack Bazzi  Do I really want to go  Probably not. Soldier  We're not supposed to talk to the media. SP  I'm not the media  dammit  MM  The day is here. Life will change. Voice  The real deal  man  Narrator  You ready  Soldier  Bring it on  Narrator  You ready  Voice    Iraq  here we come  ZB  Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat. It's natural instinct. SP  If you let fear get to you  then you're not going to be doing your job. MM  Every single time you go out there  there's attacks. It's unbelievable. ZB  Hey  Nestor  your ass crack is right in my face. Soldiers  IV  Are we on fire  IV  Man down  Man down  MM  Keep going  brother.

SP  You don't put         troops in there  and say we're there to create democracy. Soldier  We've got a drive through window at Burger King now. SP  We're here to create money. MM  I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil. Jon Baril  The worst thing in my life. SP  Baril  don't look at it  bud. Michael Moriarty's Wife  He's not the same person anymore. MM  I will not go back. Kevin Shangraw  The Iraqi people are who we are there to help    and we just killed one. Soldiers  Sergeant Smith is down  Sergeant Smith is down  There they are  Right there  Fire  fire  JB  It'll be a better country in    years  'cause we were there. I hope. One of the things I'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about. And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED. I don't know how many of you might imagine it  but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq. Paul  Come on  stand up. This is Paul Anthony. He served     Applause     with the Marines  and I want to tell you a little  brief story. We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software. Right  And we started talking. People will see my tag  and they'll see  The War Tapes   and then we'll start talking about war. We got in a conversation with some other people in the class  and it went on and on. I mean  we were there for an hour  talking. And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with  which is  I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war  and about politics. And really    because maybe we're going to disagree. Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable. How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation  And you know  Paul was talking  and he then turned to Constance and said   You know  I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here  because I know she has my back.  And I want to say  I was nervous. Because I'm used to doing Q As. I really related to what James was saying yesterday  because I'm behind the camera. You know  I can answer questions about my movie  but for me to come up and talk for    minutes is a really long time. So  I wanted to say  Paul  I'm happy you're here  because I know you have my back. This film was not about the Internet  but it could not have been made without it. The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me. In the meantime  the soldiers    we would email and IM. I didn't save all of them  because I didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of. But there were       emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save. The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it. So I wanted to show you a clip  and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together. If we could roll the clip. SP  We like to give these insurgents a fair chance. So  what we do  we ride with the windows down. Because  you know  we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding. We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down. It's not true. Very unsafe. Whoa. Soldier  Right there. SP  All right  let's get over to that site. Be advised  we're leaving Taji right now. We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji  we're heading to that location now. Soldier  That's a fucking car bomb  Soldier  Motherfuckers  Soldiers  Get your vest on  Hey  get over the fucking    yeah  yeah. Any one four elements get to the gate  SP  Sheriff one six  or any one four elements  we need you at the gate of Taji right now  over. Soldier  I'll walk you through it. SP  Stay low. Head over to the right. Get your bag  get your bag  SP  It was mass casualties. Probably    dead  at least    or    wounded Iraqis. SP  It just looked like  you know  someone had thrown a quarter through a guy  and it was just like    there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds. Everything was cauterized  and it was just like there was a void going through the body. This is the scene north. They just removed a burnt body  or half a body from here. I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down. This is blood. And you know  you walk  and you hear the pieces of skin. And that's it  that's all that's left. I remember giving three IVs  bandaging several wounded. Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall  shaking and screaming. Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform. I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji. They can work on the post for pennies  but can't die there. They've got to die outside. If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment  I would've slit his throat right there.       hours  and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads  whether we want to or not. News Anchor  More violence in Iraq. Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad. SP  We made the news. I feel exploited and proud at the same time. I've lost all faith in the media    a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of. I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass. I'll do that  then I'm gonna jerk off. Because these pages smell like Linds  and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow. Another mission at      . DS  Now     Applause     thanks. When I said earlier  to try and tell a story from the inside out  versus the outside in    part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction    is this melding. It's a new way of trying to make a documentary. When I met the guys  and    of them agreed to take cameras    in total     ended up filming. Five soldiers filmed the entire time. There are three featured in the film. The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email  and in it  attached a photo of that burned body out at the car. And the tone from the email was  you know  it had been a very bad day  obviously. And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base. So  I pinged Mike and I said   Mike  can you please go get that interview with Pink   Because the thing that very often is missing is  in the military what they call  hot wash.  It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens  you know. And if you let time go by  it kind of softens and smooths the edges. And for me  I really wanted that. So  in order to get the intimacy  to share that experience with you  the guys    the two most popular mounts    there was a camera on the turret  the gun turret  and then on the dashboard of the Humvee. Most of the Humvees  we ended up mounting two cameras in them. So you get to experience that in real time  right  The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within    hours of that episode happening. Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home. I knew about that journal  but it was very  very private. And you know  you earn someone's trust  especially in doc filmmaking  through your relationship. So  it wasn't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal. Now  the news footage I put in there to try to show    you know  I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have. But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times  American soldiers saying   Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do   OK  this is a perfect example. Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire. They didn't have to go outside the wire. There were not Americans hurt out there. They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives    the Iraqis who work on the post. So  when you may hear soldiers complaining  that's what they're talking about  you know  And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging. And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q As  and people are really opinionated. But it seems like people don't want to hear so much  or listen  or try to have an exchange. And I'm as fiery as the next person  but I really think    you know  different speakers have talked about their concern for the world  and my concern is that we have to have these conversations. And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may  you know  we think we know. But we just have to leave that little bit of openness  to know. There's such a disconnect. And for me  it's trying to bridge that disconnect. I'll share one story. I get    I'm often asked  you know  for me  what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film. And at screenings  inevitably    you know  as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff    usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions. And usually  the first questions are   Oh  what kind of cameras did you use   Or you know  these things. But there's always a few guys  almost always  who are the last ones. And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers. And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone. And for me  one of the most profound stories someone shared with me  that then became my story  was    for those of you who haven't seen the film  and it's not a spoiler    it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents  where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed. In this film  there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed. A soldier came up to me and stood  you know really  pretty close  a foot away from me. He's a big guy. And he looked at me  and I smiled  and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes. And he wasn't going to blink. And he said   My gunner was throwing candy.  And I knew what he was going to say. The gunner was throwing candy. They used to throw candy to the kids. Kids got too close  very often. And he said   I killed a child. And I'm a father. I have children. I haven't been able to tell my wife. I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster.  I hugged him  of course  and I said  you know   It's going to be OK.  And he said   I'm going to bring her to see your film. And then I'm going to tell her.  So when I talk about a disconnect  it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier  which there obviously are. You know  these days  it's not like World War II  where there was a war front and a home front  and everybody seemed involved. You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on. And often  I'll hear people say  who maybe know that I did this film  and they say   Oh  you know  I'm against the war  but I support the soldiers.  And I've started to ask them   Well  that's nice. What are you doing  Are you volunteering at a VA  You go and see anybody  Do you  if you find out your neighbor's been  do you spend some time  Not necessarily ask questions  but see if they want to talk  Do you give money to any of the charities   You know  obviously  like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing  but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers. I think  I challenge us to say    to operationalize those terms  when we say we support someone  you know  Are you a friend to them  Do you really care  And I would just say it's my hope  and I would ask you guys to please  you know  reach out a hand. And really do give them a hug. Thank you. I have    minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years. All right. We all have come from a long way  here in Africa  and converged in this region of Africa  which is a place where    percent of our evolutionary process took place. And I say that not because I am African  but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors  upright walking traces  even the first technologies in the form of stone tools. So we all are Africans  and welcome home. All right. I'm a paleoanthropologist  and my job is to define man's place in nature and explore what makes us human. And today  I will use Selam  the earliest child ever discovered  to tell you a story of all of us. Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who lived and died  .  million years ago. She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis. You don't need to remember that. That's the Lucy species  and was found by my research team in December of      in an area called Dikika. It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia. And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages. We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet. And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance  I think. After I was invited by TED  I did some digging  because that's what we do  to know about my host. You don't just jump into an invitation. And I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools   .  million years ago. First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are        years old. And evidence for first design comes        years old    beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time. And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over    percent of the same genetic material. I think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry. However  DNA analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end  telling us nothing about what happened in the middle. So  for us  paleoanthropologists  our job is to find the hard evidence  the fossil evidence  to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development. Because it's only when you do that  that you can talk about    it's only when you do that   that  you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times  and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time. That then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today. But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor. It's a systematic and scientific approach  which takes you to places that are remote  hot  hostile and often with no access. Just to give you an example  when I went to Dikika  where Selam was found  in '      and it's about     kilometers from Addis Ababa  the capital of Ethiopia. It took us only seven hours to do the first     kilometers of the      but took four  solid hours to do the last only    kilometers. With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks  I made my way. I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot. When you get there  this is what you see  and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable. And once you make it there  the big question is where to start. And you find nothing for years and years. When I go to places like this  which are paleontological sites  it's like going to a game park  an extinct game park. But what you find are not the human remains  such as Selam and Lucy  on a day to day basis. You find elephants  rhinos  monkeys  pigs  etc. But you could ask  how could these large mammals live in this desert environment  Of course  they cannot  but I'm telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today. A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this. Anyway  once we made it there  then it's a game park  as I said  an extinct game park. And our ancestors lived in that game park  but were just the minorities. They were not as successful and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are. To tell you just an example  an anecdote about their rarity  I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here  and the assistants  of course  helped me do the surveys. They would find a bone and tell me   Here is what you're looking for.  I would say   No  that's an elephant.  Again  another one   That's a monkey.   That's a pig   etc. So one of my assistants  who never went to school  said to me   Listen  Zeray. You either don't know what you're looking for  or you're looking in the wrong place   he said. And I said   Why    Because there were elephants and lions  and the people were scared and went somewhere else. Let's go somewhere else.  Well  he was very tired  and it's really tiring. It was then  after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam  and you see the face here covered by sandstone. And here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block  because she was buried by a river. What you have here seems to be nothing  but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human. This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology  an amazing piece of our long  long history. There were these three people and me  and I am taking the pictures  that's why I am not in. How would you feel if you were me  You have something extraordinary in your hand  but you are in the middle of nowhere  The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement  of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility  of making sure everything is safe. Here is a close up of the fossil  after five years of cleaning  preparation and description  which was very long  as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide. It took five years. In a way  this was like the second birth for the child  after  .  million years  but the labor was very long. And here is full scale    it's a tiny bone. And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism  who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there. And you see me worried and trying to protect my child  because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child  even a minister. So then  once you've done that  the next stage is to know what it is. Once that was done  then it was possible to compare. We were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs  the foot  and some features clearly showed that she walked upright  and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity. But in addition  if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here  you see that you have vertical forehead. And you see that in humans  because of the development of the pre frontal cortex  it's called. You don't see that in chimpanzees  and you don't see this very projecting canine. So she belongs to our family tree  but within that  of course  you do detailed analysis  and we know now that she belongs to the Lucy species  known as Australopithecus afarensis. The next exciting question is  girl or boy  And how old was she when she died  You can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth. How  You know  in primates  there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism  which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females. But to do that  you need the permanent dentition  which you don't see here  because what you have here are the baby teeth. But using the CT scanning technology  which is normally used for medical purposes  you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still growing adult teeth here. So when you measure those teeth  it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth. And to know how old she was when she died  what you do is you do an informed estimate  and you say  how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth  and the answer was three. So  this girl died when she was about three   .  million years ago. So  with all that information  the big question is    what do we actually    what does she tell us  To answer this question  we can phrase another question. What do we actually know about our ancestors  We want to know how they looked like  how they behaved  how they walked around  and how they lived and grew up. And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included  first  this skeleton documents  for the first time  how infants looked over three million years ago. And second  she tells us that she walked upright  but had some adaptation for tree climbing. And more interesting  however  is the brain in this child was still growing. At age three  if you have a still growing brain  it's a human behavior. In chimps  by age three  the brain is formed over    percent. That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth    faster than us  anyway. But in humans  we continue to grow our brains. That's why we need care from our parents. But that care means also you learn. You spend more time with your parents. And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood  which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents. So  the still growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood  which requires an incredible social organization  a very complex social organization  emerged over three million years ago. So  by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history  Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human. But not everything was human  and I will give you a very exciting example. This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here. It supports your tongue from behind. It's  in a way  your voice box. It determines the type of voice you produce. It was not known in the fossil record  and we have it in this skeleton. When we did the analysis of this bone  it was clear that it looked very chimp like  chimpanzee like. So if you were there  .  million years ago  to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother  she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human. Maybe you're wondering   So  you see this ape feature  human feature  ape feature. What does that tell us   You know  that is very exciting for us  because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively  and that evolution is in the making. To summarize the significance of this fossil  we can say the following. Up to now  the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils  the baby fossils  were missing. They don't preserve well  as you know. So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors  on how they looked like  how they behaved  was kind of biased toward adults. Imagine somebody coming from Mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet Earth  and you hide all the babies  the children  and he goes back and reports. Can you imagine how much biased his report would be  That's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children  so I think the new fossil fixes this problem. So  I think the most important question at the end is  what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general  Of course  in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human  you know  the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years    and there are more than       they did not have the knowledge  the technology and sophistications that we  Homo sapiens  have today. But if this species  ancient species  would travel in time and see us today  they would very much be very proud of their legacy  because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe. And they were probably not aware of this future legacy  but they did great. Now the question is  we Homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet  possibly more. So the question is  are we up to the challenge  And can we really do better than these primitive  small brained ancestors  Among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa. Needless to list them here  and there are more competent people to talk about this. Still  in my opinion  we have two choices. One is to continue to see a poor  ill  crying Africa  carrying guns  that depends on other people forever  or to promote an Africa which is confident  peaceful  independent  but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time. I am for the second option  and I'm sure many of you are. And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa. That's because we Africans concentrate    I am from Ethiopia  by the way    we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere  or from outside. I think it's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves. That's what I call positive African attitude. So finally  I would like to say  so let's help Africa walk upright and forward  then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species. Thank you. On simplicity. What a great way to start. First of all  I've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such  For Dummies.  Do you know these books  these such and such  For Dummies   My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking  so this is a bit of a problem. But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this. You know  there's also something called the  Complete Idiot's Guide   There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense. We like to have technology make us feel bad  for some strange reason. But I really like that  so I wrote a book called  The Laws of Simplicity.  I was in Milan last week  for the Italian launch. It's kind of a book about questions  questions about simplicity. Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself  what is simplicity  Is it good  Is it bad  Is complexity better  I'm not sure. After I wrote  The Laws of Simplicity   I was very tired of simplicity  as you can imagine. And so in my life  I've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over achiever. Because your companies will always take away your life  but they can never take away your vacation    in theory. So  I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity  and I went to the Gap  because I only have black pants. So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever  and unfortunately  their branding was all about  Keep It Simple.  I opened up a magazine  and Visa's branding was   Business Takes Simplicity.  I develop photographs  and Kodak said   Keep It Simple.  So  I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around. So  I turned on the TV  and I don't watch TV very much  but you know this person  This is Paris Hilton  apparently. And she has this show   The Simple Life.  So I watched this. It's not very simple  a little bit confusing. So  I looked for a different show to watch. So  I opened up this TV Guide thing  and on the E  channel  this  Simple Life  show is very popular. They'll play it over  and over  and over. So it was traumatizing  actually. So  I wanted to escape again  so I went out to my car. And Cape Cod  there are idyllic roads  and all of us can drive in this room. And when you drive  these signs are very important. It's a very simple sign  it says   road  and  road approaching.  So I'm mostly driving along  okay  and then I saw this sign. So  I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly  so I thought   Ah  simplicity. Very important.  But then I thought   Oh  simplicity. What would that be like on a beach  What if the sky was    percent gray  Wouldn't that be the perfect sky   I mean that simplicity sky. But in reality  the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful  complex sky. You know  with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity. We're human beings  we love complex things. We love relationships    very complex. So we love this kind of stuff. I'm at this place called the Media Lab. Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place. It's designed by I. M. Pei  one of the premier modernist architects. Modernism means white box  and it's a perfect white box. And some of you guys are entrepreneurs  etc.  whatever. Last month  I was at Google  and  boy  that cafeteria  man. You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options. See  in academia  we get titles  lots of titles. Last year at TED  these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles. I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters. This year at TED  I'm happy to report that I have new titles  in addition to my previous titles. Another  Associate Director of Research.  And this also happened  so I have five daughters now. That's my baby Reina.  Applause  Thank you. And so  my life is much more complex because of the baby  actually  but that's okay. We will still stay married  I think. But looking way back  when I was a child    you see  I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle. Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu  but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food. It's very hard work to make tofu. As a child  we used to wake up at   a.m. and work till   p.m.  six days a week. My father was kind of like Andy Grove  paranoid of the competition. So often  seven days a week. Family business equals child labor. We were a great model. So  I loved going to school. School was great  and maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place  I'm not sure. Thank you. But the Media Lab is an interesting place  and it's important to me because as a student  I was a computer science undergrad  and I discovered design later on in my life. And there was this person  Muriel Cooper. Who knows Muriel Cooper  Muriel Cooper  Wasn't she amazing  Muriel Cooper. She was wacky. And she was a TEDster  exactly  and she showed us  she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again. And she's very important in my life  because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school. It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school  because of her. She passed away in       and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes  but it's so hard. This amazing person  Muriel Cooper. When I was in Japan    I went to an art school in Japan    I had a nice sort of situation  because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand. Some of you guys know Paul Rand  the greatest graphic designer    I'm sorry    out there. The great graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo  the Westinghouse logo. He basically said   I've designed everything.  And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life    the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan  like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji. When you have mentors    and yesterday  Kareem Abdul Jabbar talked about mentors  these people in your life    the problem with mentors is that they all die. This is a sad thing  but it's actually a happy thing in a way  because you can remember them in their pure form. I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us. When you get older  and you're all freaked out  whatever  the mentors calm us down. And I'm grateful for my mentors  and I'm sure all of you are too. Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT. The T doesn't stand for  human   it stands for  technology.  And because of that  I always wondered about this human thing. So  I've always been Googling this word   human   to find out how many hits I get. And in       I had    million hits  and for  computer   because computers are against humans a bit  I have    million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here. So  if you sort of compare that  like this  you'll see that computer versus human    I've been tracking this for the last year    computer versus human over the last year has changed. It used to be kind of two to one. Now  humans are catching up. Very good  us humans  We're catching up with the computers. In the simplicity realm  it's also interesting. So if you compare complexities to simplicity  it's also catching up in a way  too. So  somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined  I think. I have a confession  I'm not a man of simplicity. I spent my entire early career making complex stuff. Lots of complex stuff. I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this. I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this. And I've always felt bad about it  in a sense. So  I hid in a time dimension. I built things in a time graphics dimension. I did this series of calendars for Shiseido. This is a floral theme calendar in       and this is a firework calendar. So  you launch the number into space  because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks  you're cooler for some reason. This is why they have fireworks in the summer. A very extreme culture. Lastly  this is a fall based calendar  because I have so many leaves in my yard. So this is the leaves in my yard  essentially. And so I made a lot of these types of things. I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things  and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes. I feel kind of bad about that. Tomorrow  Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola. She has this show right now at MoMA  where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA  on the walls. If you're in New York  please go and see that. But I've had a problem  because I make all this flying stuff and people say   Oh  I know your work. You're the guy that makes eye candy.  And when you're told this  you feel kind of weird.  Eye candy     sort of pejorative  don't you think  So  I say   No  I make eye meat   instead. And eye meat is something different  something more fibrous  something more powerful  perhaps. But what could that be  eye meat  I've been interested in computer programs all my life  actually. Computer programs are essentially trees  and when you make art with a computer program  there's kind of a problem. Whenever you make art with a computer program  you're always on the tree  and the paradox is that for excellent art  you want to be off the tree. So  this is sort of a complication I've found. So  to get off the tree  I began to use my old computers. I took these to Tokyo in      to make computer objects. This is a new way to type  on my old  color Classic. You can't type very much on this. I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself  so this is a self drawing machine. And also  one year  the G  Bondi Blue thing    that caddy would come out  like  dangerous  like   whack   like that. But I thought   This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test   So I have a crash test. And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made  just to sort of understand what these things are. Shortly after this       happened  and I was very depressed. I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss  and sort of really sad things  and so I wanted to think about something happy. So I focused on food as my area    these sort of clementine peel things. In Japan  it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece. Who's done that before  One piece clementine  Oh  you guys are missing out  if you haven't done it yet. It was very good  and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this  actually  in different forms. If you dry them quick  you can make  like  elephants and steers and stuff  and my wife didn't like these  because they mold  so I had to stop that. So  I went back to the computer  and I bought five large fries  and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme  and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french fry images. And as a child  I'd hear that song  you know   Oh  beautiful  for spacious skies  for amber waves of grain   so I made this amber waves image. It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. And also  as a child  I was the fattest kid in class  so I used to love Cheetos. Oh  I love Cheetos  yummy. So  I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way. I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint. Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos. I discovered that Cheetos are good  expressive material. And with these Cheetos  I began to think   What can I make with these Cheetos   And so  I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks  and also pretzels. I was looking for some kind of form  and in the end  I made     butter fries. Do you get it  And each butter fry is composed of different pieces. People ask me how they make the antenna. Sometimes  they find a hair in the food. That's my hair. My hair's clean    it's okay. I'm a tenured professor  which means  basically  I don't have to work anymore. It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte. End of story. But I realized that life could be very boring  so I've been thinking about life  and I notice that my camera    my digital camera versus my car  a very strange thing. The car is so big  the camera is so small  yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual. It doesn't make any sense. So  I was in the Cape one time  and I typed the word  simplicity   and I discovered  in this weird  M. Night Shyamalan way  that I discovered  the  letters  M  I  T. You know the word  In the words  simplicity  and  complexity   M  I  T occur in perfect sequence. It's a bit eerie  isn't it  So  I thought  maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something. And I wrote this book   The Laws of Simplicity.  It's a very short  simple book. There are ten laws and three keys. The ten laws and three keys    I won't go over them because that's why I have a book  and also that's why it's on the Web for free. But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way  there are all kinds. In Japan  they say that sushi is challenging. You know the uni is the most challenging  so number ten is challenging. People hate number ten like they hate uni  actually. The three keys are easy to eat  so this is anago  cooked already  so easy to eat. So enjoy your sushi meal later  with the laws of simplicity. Because I want to simplify them for you. Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing. So  if I simplify the laws of simplicity  I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing. Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie  which cookie are they going to take  The big cookie. You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it  but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie. But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold  the small pile or the big pile  which will they choose  Strangely  not the big pile. So  I think it's as simple as this. You know  when you want more  it's because you want to enjoy it. When you want less  it's because it's about work. And so  to boil it all down  simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain. I think this is sort of simple more versus less. Basically  it always depends. This book I wrote because I want to figure out life. I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things. And so life is a big question  I think  in simplicity  because you're trying to simplify your life. And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place. By being at TED  we see so many things at one time. And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world. Like everything you see  every time you wake up. It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world. From everything from a weird hotel lobby  to Saran wrap placed over your window  to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black  and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun. And so  this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here  because life is finite. This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido. He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are    twelve years old  twenty four years old  seventy four  ninety six years old    and this is some medical data. So  brain strength increases up to     and then after     it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way. Also  if you look at your physical strength. You know  I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT  so I tell them   Oh  your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger  but in your late twenties and mid thirties  cells  they die.  OK. It gets them to work harder  sometimes. And if you have your vision  vision is interesting. As you age from infant age  your vision gets better  and maybe in your late teens  early twenties  you're looking for a mate  and your vision goes after that. Your social responsibility is very interesting. So  as you get older  you may  like  have kids  whatever. And then the kids graduate  and you have no responsibility any more    that's very good  too. But if any of you people ask   What actually goes up  Does anything go up  What's the positive part of this  you know   I think wisdom always goes up. I love these eighty year old  ninety year old guys and women. They have so many thoughts  and they have so much wisdom  and I think    you know  this TED thing  I've come here. And this is the fourth time  and I come here for this wisdom  I think. This whole TED effect  it sort of ups your wisdom  somehow. And I'm so glad to be here  and I'm very grateful to be here  Chris. And this is an amazing experience for me as well. The advances that have taken place in astronomy  cosmology and biology  in the last    years  are really extraordinary    to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works than many of you might imagine. But there was something else that I've noticed as those changes were taking place  as people were starting to find out that hmm ... yeah  there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy. The science writers and editors    I shouldn't say science writers  I should say people who write about science    and editors would sit down over a couple of beers  after a hard day of work  and start talking about some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works. And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place  which is ways the world could end very suddenly. And that's what I want to talk about today.  Laughter  Ah  you laugh  you fools.  Laughter  Stephen Petranek  At first  it all seemed a little fantastical to me  but after challenging a lot of these ideas  I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September    happened  and I thought  ah  God  I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end. Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this  And that got me into a discussion with some other people  other scientists  about maybe some other subjects  and one of the guys I talked to  who was a neuroscientist  said   You know  I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up   and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem. So  we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow  and lo and behold  we found them. Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago. Can we run that  Andrew  President George W. Bush  Whatever it costs to defend our security  and whatever it costs to defend our freedom  we must pay it. SP  I agree with the president. He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year  a two trillion dollar federal budget  which will land us back into deficit spending real fast. But terrorists aren't the only threat we face. There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism  and what could've happened on September   . I would propose  therefore  that if we took    billion dollars from that  .   trillion dollar budget    which is two one hundredths of that budget    and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems I'm going to talk to you about  the vast majority could be solved  and the rest we could deal with. So  I hope you find this both fascinating    I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff  I gotta admit    to me these are Richard's cockroaches. But I also hope  because I think the people in this room can literally change the world  I hope you take some of this stuff away with you  and when you have an opportunity to be influential  that you try to get some heavy duty money spent on some of these ideas. So let's start. Number     we lose the will to survive. We live in an incredible age of modern medicine. We are all much healthier than we were    years ago. People around the world are getting better medicine    but mentally  we're falling apart. The World Health Organization now estimates that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed. And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced. Soon  genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine are going to allow us to think of     as a normal lifespan. A female child born tomorrow  on average    median    will live to age   . Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes. Now the problem with all of this  getting older  is that people over    are the most likely people to commit suicide. So  what are the solutions  We don't really have mental health insurance in this country  and it's     Applause     it's really a crime. Something like    percent of all people with depression  and I mean really severe depression    I have a friend with stunningly severe depression    this is a curable disease  with present medicine and present technology. But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills. Pills alone don't do it  especially in clinically depressed people. You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist  and put down your    dollar copay  and get treated  just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous. Secondly  drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological component that can be dealt with. And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we did    years ago. We need a pump push from the federal government  through NIH and National Science    NSF    and places like that to start helping the drug companies develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. Moving on. Number nine    don't laugh    aliens invade Earth. Ten years ago  you couldn't have found an astronomer    well  very few astronomers    in the world who would've told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.       we found three. The count now is up to       we're finding about two or three a month. All of the ones we've found  by the way  are in this little  teeny  tiny corner where we live  in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way  and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years  and was laughed at for it  there must be billions and billions in the universe. In a few years  NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter  where there's less dust  and start looking for Earth like planets  which we cannot see with present technology  nor detect. It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe  and probably fairly close to us  is a fairly remote idea. And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea. Remember  we've only been an advanced civilization    an industrial civilization  if you would    for     years. Although every time I go to Pompeii  I'm amazed that they had the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner  too. So  I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD     but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this  and I don't believe in aliens  and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own. Now  what will happen  What if they come to  you know  suck up our oceans for the hydrogen  And swat us away like flies  the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it. We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said   Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with  even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization.  If the aliens come visiting  we're the primitive civilization. So  what are the solutions to this   Laughter  Thank God you can all read  It may seem ridiculous  but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this and actually being prepared for them. How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species  Secondly    and you're going to hear more from me about this    we have to become an outward looking  space faring nation. We have got to develop the idea that the Earth doesn't last forever  our sun doesn't last forever. If we want humanity to last forever  we have to colonize the Milky Way. And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point. It'll also help us a lot  if we meet an advanced civilization along the way  if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight    SP  You've got it  You've got the job. Number eight  the ecosystem collapses. Last July  in Science  the journal Science     oceanographers published a very  very unusual article. It wasn't really a research report  it was a screed. They said  we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now  and we want to tell you they're not in trouble  they're near collapse. Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real  real danger. We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record by a factor of       . We have lost    percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last    years. California is expected to lose    percent of its species in the next    years. Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree. You cut down that tree  the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem. There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to. And when that ecosystem collapses  it could take a major ecosystem with it  like our atmosphere. So  what do we do about this  What are the solutions  There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now. The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly  that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late. We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble  and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models. And with the kind of computing power we have now  there is  as I say  some of this going on  but it needs money. National Science Foundation needs to say    you know  almost all the money that's spent on science in this country comes from the federal government  one way or another. And they get to prioritize  you know  There are people at the National Science Foundation who get to say  this is the most important thing. This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about. Secondly  we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet  and start moving them around. There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank  or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no take fishing zone. They can't fish there for a radius of     miles. And an amazing thing has happened  almost all the fish have come back  and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this around the globe. We're going to have to have no take zones. We're going to have to say  no more logging in the Amazon for    years. Let it recover  before we start logging again. Number seven  particle accelerator mishap. You all remember Ted Kaczynski  the Unabomber  One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world. A lot of very sober minded physicists  believe it or not  have had exactly the same thought. This spring    there's a collider at Brookhaven  on Long Island    this spring  it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes. They are expecting to create little  tiny black holes. They expect them to evaporate.  Laughter  I hope they're right.  Laughter  Other collider experiments    there's one that's going to take place next summer at CERN    have the possibility of creating something called strangelets  which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter  they destroy it and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets that we need to worry about  and they're probably right. But  all around the world  in Japan  in Canada  there's talk about this  of reviving this in the United States. We shut one down that was going to be big. But there's talk of building very big accelerators. What can we do about this  What are the solutions  We've got the fox watching the henhouse here. We need to    we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics and what should be done in particle physics  but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging of what's going on with these experiments. Secondly  we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth. We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth  and it's constantly bombarded by high energy particles  like protons. And in my opinion  we don't spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth. Number six  biotech disaster. It's one of my favorite ones  because we've done several stories on Bt corn. Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer. You may of heard of it    heard it called StarLink  especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago. This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States  and it got into the human food supply  and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily. But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago  in Mexico  where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal  they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants. Now  corn originated  we think  in Mexico. This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn. This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently  that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world  from biotechnology  that literally could destroy the world's food supply in very short order. So  what do we do about that  We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants. It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field. When the StarLink disaster happened  there was a battle between the EPA and the FDA over who really had authority  and over what parts of this  and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy. Number five  one of my favorites  reversal of the Earth's magnetic field. Believe it or not  this happens every few hundred thousand years  and has happened many times in our history. North Pole goes to the South  South Pole goes to the North  and vice versa. But what happens  as this occurs  is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about     years  and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun  that this field protects us from  are    well  basically  we're gonna fry.  Laughter  SP  So  what can we do about this  Oh  by the way  we're overdue. It's been         years since this happened. So  it should have happened about         years ago. Oh  and here's one other thing. Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent. So  maybe we're in the throes of it. One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is  is that we have    you know  we don't have good weather data from    years ago  much less data on things like the ozone layer. So  there's a fairly simple solution to this. There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply. You know  we can make ozone from car tailpipes. It's not hard  it's just three oxygen atoms. If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth  it would be the thickness of two pennies  at    pounds per square inch. You don't need that much up there. We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer. Number four  giant solar flares. Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun that bombard the Earth with high speed subatomic particles. So far  our atmosphere has done  and our magnetic field has done pretty well protecting us from this. Occasionally  we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth  and electricity. But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying stars that are similar to our Sun  and they've found that a number of them  when they're about the age of our Sun  brighten by a factor of as much as   . Doesn't last for very long. And they think these are super flares  millions of times more powerful than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. Obviously  we don't want one of those.  Laughter  There's a flip side to it. In studying stars like our Sun  we've found that they go through periods of diminishment  when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent. One percent doesn't sound like a lot  but it would cause one hell of an ice age here. So  what can we do about this  I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in     . This is rocket science  but it's not hard rocket science. Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars  and to make a livable planet on Mars  is probably there. And you just  literally  have to send little nuclear factories up there that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen. The problem is it takes     years to terraform Mars  minimum. Really more like     years to do it right. There's no reason why we shouldn't start now.  Laughter  Number three    isn't this stuff cool   Laughter  A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs ever since there have been people  and from time to time  the germs sure get the upper hand. In       we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed    million people. That was back when the population was around     million people. The bubonic plague in Europe  in the Middle Ages  killed one out of four Europeans. AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head with much too much frequency  and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics. We've all learned what    the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head  like anthrax. The worst possibility is that a very simple germ  like staph  for which we have one antibiotic that still works  mutates. And we know staph can do amazing things. A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come  and change and mutate. The danger is that some germ like staph will be    will mutate into something that's really virulent  very contagious  and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it. That's happened before. About        years ago  there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas  and that is thought to have been a virulent disease. So  what can we do about it  It is nuts. We give antibiotics     Applause     every cow  every lamb  every chicken  they get antibiotics every day  all. You know  you go to a restaurant  you eat fish  I got news for you  it's all farmed. You know  you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish  cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code. This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code. We're telling the germs out there how to fight us. We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away. Secondly  our public health system  as we saw with anthrax  is a real disaster. We have a real  major outbreak of disease in the United States  we are not prepared to cope with it. Now  there is money in the federal budget  next year  to build up the public health service. But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done. Number two    my favorite    we meet a rogue black hole. You know     years ago  or    years ago  really  you walk into an astronomy convention  and you say   You know  there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy   and they're going to hoot you off the stage. And now  if you went into one of those conventions and you said   Well  I don't think black holes are out there   they'd hoot you off the stage. Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really    has just gained unbelievably in recent years. We think that there are about    million dead stars in the Milky Way alone  our galaxy. And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like        miles wide  and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them  including light  which is why we can't see them. Most of them should be in orbit around something. But galaxies are very violent places  and things can be spun out of orbit. And also  space is incredibly vast. So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit  the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote. But it only has to get close  about a billion miles away  one of these things. About a billion miles away  here's what happens to Earth's orbit  it becomes elliptical instead of circular. And for three months out of the year  the surface temperatures go up to     to    . For three months out of the year  they go to    below zero. That won't work too well. What can we do about this  And this is my scariest.  Laughter  I don't have a good answer for this one. Again  we gotta think about being a colonizing race. And finally  number one  biggest danger to life as we know it  I think  a really big asteroid heads for Earth. The important thing to remember here    this is not a question of if  this is a question of when  and how big. In       just a     foot piece of a comet exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe     miles. It had the effect of about       Hiroshima bombs. Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years. In       a large asteroid passed         miles away from Earth. Nothing to worry about  right  It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier. A small asteroid  say a half mile wide  would touch off firestorms followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up    Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing. An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions. We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide. Where are they  There's something called the Kuiper belt  which    some people think Pluto's not a planet  that's where Pluto is  it's in the Kuiper belt. There's also something a little farther out  called the Oort cloud. There are about         balls of ice and rock    comets  really    out there  that are    miles in diameter or more  and they regularly take a little spin  in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us. Of more concern  I think  is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter. The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall    they're making the first map of the universe  three dimensional map of the universe    that there are probably         asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that are a half a mile big or bigger. So you say  yeah  well  what are really the chances of this happening  Andrew  can you put that chart up  This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute presented to Congress a few years ago. You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid slash comet impact killing you is about one in         according to the work they've done. Now look at the one right below that. Passenger aircraft crash  one in       . We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents  and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet  this is completely preventable. We finally have  just in the last year  the technology to stop this cold. Could we have the solutions  NASA's spending three million dollars a year  three million bucks    that is like pocket change    to search for asteroids. Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there  and if it might hit Earth  and when it might hit Earth. And they're trying to do that. But it's going to take them    years  at spending three million dollars a year  and even then  they claim they'll only have about    percent of them catalogued. Comets are a tougher act. We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories  or when one with our name on it might arrive. But we would have lots of time  if we see it coming. We really need a dedicated observatory. You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of  amateur astronomers  That's because nobody's looking for them  except amateurs. We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. Part two of the solutions  we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid  or alter its trajectory. Now  a year ago  we did an amazing thing. We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt  called NEAR  Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. And these guys orbited a       or no  about a    mile long asteroid called Eros. And then  of course  you know  they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things  where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything  and then  at the last minute  they landed. When the mission was over  they actually landed on the thing. We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal. Now  the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don't have anything to push against in space  because there's no air. A nuclear explosion is just as hot  but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a    mile long asteroid  or vaporize it  would be more like it. But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it  which would gently  slowly  after a period of time  push it into a different trajectory  which  if we've done our math right  would keep it from hitting Earth. This is just a matter of finding 'em  going there  and doing something about it. I know your head is spinning from all this stuff. Yikes  So many big threats  The thing  I think  to remember  is September   . We don't want to get caught flat footed again. We know about this stuff. Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now. Knowledge is power. The worst thing we can do is say  jeez  I got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid.  Laughter  That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future. Thank you. I am known best for human powered flight  but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that I'm working in now. As a youngster  I was very interested in model airplanes  ornithopters  autogyros  helicopters  gliders  power planes  indoor models  outdoor models  everything  which I just thought was a lot of fun  and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them. And then  navy pilot training  and  after college  I got into sailplane flying  power plane flying  and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun  but got tangled up with some great professor types  who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science. While this was all going on  I was in the field of weather modification  although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics. The weather modification subject was getting started  and as a graduate student  I could go around to the various talks that were being given  on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast  and so on. And everybody would talk to me  but all the professionals in the field hated each other  and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result  I got the absolutely unique background in that field  and started a company  which did more research in weather modification than anybody  and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into. But then       started AeroVironment  with no employees    then one or two  three  and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects. We had AirDynamisis  who  like I  did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big  many year project  and so we did our small projects  and the company slowly grew. The thing that is exciting was  in       I suddenly got interested in the human powered airplane because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of         dollars  or I guaranteed the money at the bank. He needed them    he needed the money for starting a company. The company did not succeed  and he couldn't pay the money back  and I was the guarantor of the note. So  I had a          debt  and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human powered flight  which had then been around for     Laughter        years at the time  was        pounds  which  at the exchange rate  was just about         dollars. So suddenly  I was interested in human powered flight    and did not    the way I approached it  first  thinking about ways to make the planes  was just like they'd been doing in England  and not succeeding  and I gave it up. I figured  nah  there isn't any simple  easy way. But then  got off on a vacation trip  and was studying bird flight  just for the fun of it  and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles  and measure the time  and estimate the bank angle  and immediately  figure out its speed  and the turning radius  and so on  which I could do in the car  as we're driving along on a vacation trip    with my three sons  young sons  helping me  but ridiculing the whole thing very much. But that began thinking about how birds went around  and then how airplanes would  how hang gliders would fly  and then other planes  and the idea of the Gossamer Condor type airplane quickly emerged  was so logical  one should have thought of it in the first place  but one didn't. And it was just  keep the weight down       pounds was all it weighed    but let the size swell up  like a hang glider  but three times the span  three times the cord. You're down to a third of the speed  a third of the power  and a good bicyclist can put out that power  and that worked  and we won the prize a year later. We didn't    a lot of flying  a lot of experiments  a lot of things that didn't work  and ones that did work  and the plane kept getting a little better  a little better. Got a good pilot  Brian Allen  to operate it  and finally  succeeded. But unfortunately  about        dollars was spent on the project. And there was only about    to help retire the debt. But fortunately  Henry Kramer  who put up the prize for    that was a one mile flight    put up a new prize for flying the English Channel     miles. And he thought it would take another    years for somebody to win that. We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit  the power to fly would be decreased a little bit  and if you decrease the power required a little  the pilot can fly a much longer period of time. And Brian Allen was able  in a miraculous flight  to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel  and we won the         pound          dollar prize for that. And when all expenses were paid  the debt was handled  and everything was fine. It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt  so for five years  six years  I only had to pay one third income tax. So  there were good economic reasons for the project  but    that's not  well  the project was done entirely for economic reasons  and we have not been involved in any human powered flight since then    because the prizes are all over. But that sure started me thinking about various things  and immediately  we began making a solar powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world  we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased  which is what the government was trying to do with it. And we thought a solar powered plane wouldn't really make sense  but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field. And that project continued  did succeed  and we then got into other projects in aviation and mechanical things and ground devices. But while this was going on  in       I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation    their annual prize    and I had to prepare a paper on it  which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years. This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I  really  was after  and what was important. And to my surprise  I realized the importance of environmental issues  which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to  and preparing that paper did me a lot of good. I thought back about if I was a space traveler  and came and visited Earth every       years. And for a few thousand visits  I would see the same thing every time  the little differences in the Earth. But this last time  just coming round  right now  suddenly  there'd be huge changes in the environment  in the concentration of people  and it was just unbelievable  the amount of    all the change in it. I wanted to    well  one of the biggest changes is      years ago  we began using coal from underground  which has a lot of pollution  and     years ago  began getting gasoline from underground  with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption  or production  will reach its limit in about ten years  and then go down  and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation. I wanted to show the slide    this slide  I think  is the most important one any of you will see  ever  because    it shows nature versus humans  and goes from      to     . And so  the year       you see there. And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates. Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on  are    the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion. The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion. Humans  livestock and pets are  now     percent of the total world's mass of vertebrates on land and air. And you don't know what the future will hold  but it's not going to get a lower percentage. Ten thousand years ago  the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve. Now they are    percent  and it  I think  shows human domination of the Earth. I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer  and ask them  after they've asked me questions  and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions. What's the population of the Earth  What's the population of the Earth going to be when you're the age of your parents  Which I'd never  really    they had never  really  thought about but  now  they think about it. And then  what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on  and be for                   And they form little groups  all fighting with each other  and when I leave  two hours later  most of them are saying about   billion people  and they don't have any clue about how to get down to   billion  nor do I  but I think they're right and this is a serious problem. Rachel Carson was thinking of these  and came out with  Silent Spring   way back.  Solar Manifesto  by Hermann Scheer  in Germany  claims all energy on Earth can be derived  for every country  from solar energy and water  and so on. You don't need to dig down for these chemicals  and we can do things much more efficiently. Let's have the next slide. So this just summarizes it.  Over billions of years  on a unique sphere  chance has painted a thin covering of life    complex and probable  wonderful and fragile. Suddenly  we humans  a recently arrived species  no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature  have grown in population  technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We  now  wield the paintbrush.  We're in charge. It's frightening. And I do a painting every    or    years. This is the last one. And  it  shows the Earth in a time flag  on the right  in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on  and over the triangle  we now get to civilization and TV and traffic jams and so on. I have no idea of what comes next  so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future  as a little warning. And two weeks after this drawing was done  we actually had our first project contract  at AeroVironment  on robotic cockroaches  which was very frightening to me. Well  that'll be all the slides. As time went on  we stopped our environmental programs. We focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future  and we produced products for the company. And we developed the impact car that General Motors made  the EV   out of    and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars  but they've since come apart. And we've done a lot of things  small drone airplanes and so on. I have a Helios. We have the first video. Her designers' attention to detail and her construction gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere. This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves. Paul MacCready  The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think. Narrator  And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun  to maximize the power from her solar array. As the sky gets darker  and the outside air temperatures drop below minus     degrees Fahrenheit  the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey has gone by without notice  except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors. Approaching a peak radar altitude of        feet  at      p.m.  Helios is standing on top of    percent of the Earth's atmosphere. This is more than        feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR    Blackbird. PM  That plane has many purposes  but it's aimed for communications  and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at        feet. Eventually  it will be able to have to stay up day  night  day  night  for six months at a time  acting like the synchronous satellite  but only ten miles above the Earth. Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum. In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses  a cutting edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry  assemble  and launch by hand. Battery powered  it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high resolution video pictures back to the operator. With on board GPS  it can navigate autonomously  and it is rugged enough to self land without damage. PM  Okay  and let's have the next. That plane is widely used by the military  now  in all their operations. Let's have the next video. Alan Alda  He's got it  he's got it  he's got it on his head. We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus by meeting his son  Tyler  who  with his two brothers  helped build the Gossamer Condor     years ago. Tyler MacCready  You can chase it  like this  for hours. AA  When they got bored with their father's project  they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own. TM  And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing  or on the other. AA  They called it their Walkalong Glider. I've never seen anything like that. How old were you when you invented that  TM  Oh        .  AA  Oh my God.  TM      something like that.  AA  That's amazing.  PM  And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong. TM  All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags  and one of the first things  the production version seemed to dive a little bit  and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it. I'll give you a demonstration of how it works. The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body  like a seagull soaring on a cliff. As the wind comes up  it has to go over the cliff  so as you walk through the air  it goes around your body  some has to go over you. And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current. The launch is the difficult part  you've got to hold it high up  over your head  and you start walking forward  and just let go of it  and you can control it like that. And then also  like it said in the video  you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another. So I can do it    oops  that was going to be a right turn. Okay  this one will be a left turn. Here  but    anyway. And that's it  so you can just control it  wherever you want  and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production  so you have real collector's items. And this  we just wanted to show you    if we can get the video running on this  yeah    just an example of a little video surveillance. This was flying around in the party last night  and    you can see how it just can fly around  and you can spy on anybody you want. And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane  but I was worried about hitting people in here  so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle. And that's it  yeah  just a few inventions. All right. In the next    minutes  I'm going to take you on a journey. And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now  and it began some    years ago  when humans first stepped off our planet. And in those    years  not only did we literally  physically set foot on the moon  but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets    all eight of them    and we have landed on asteroids  we have rendezvoused with comets  and  at this point in time  we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto  the body formerly known as a planet. And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey  a voyage to understand something  to get a sense of our cosmic place  to understand something of our origins  and how Earth  our planet  and we  living on it  came to be. And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this  there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before    we visited Saturn in the early     s    but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft  traveling across interplanetary space for seven years  glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of       and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun. Now  the Saturn system is a rich planetary system. It offers mystery  scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare  and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach. In fact  just studying the rings alone  we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies. And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula  which is our closest  largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. And then  here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy  taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us  and also how humans fit into that picture. And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini. I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years  because I simply don't have the time. So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn  and have been for the past two and a half years. Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons. They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S. Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn  in fact  show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione  and then  here's Saturn showing the rings edge on  showing you just how vertically thin they are  with the moon Enceladus. Now  two of the    moons that Saturn has are standouts. And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon  and  until Cassini had arrived there  was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system. And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets. It has a very large  thick atmosphere  and in fact  its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth  or at least had in the past  than any other body in the solar system. Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen  like you are breathing here in this room  except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane. And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down  and their products join together to make haze particles. This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan. And that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum. But these haze particles  it was surmised  before we got there with Cassini  over billions and billions of years  gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge. So like the equivalent  the Titan equivalent  of tar  or oil  or what    we didn't know what. But this is what we suspected. And these molecules  especially methane and ethane  can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan. And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth. It's a condensable in the atmosphere  and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds  OK  and above those clouds  you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze  which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface. The temperature at the surface is some     degrees below zero Fahrenheit. But despite that cold  you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan. And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth  it carves gullies  it forms rivers and cataracts  it can create canyons  it can pool in large basins and craters. It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills  down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute. Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like. It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth. It's cold  it's eerie  it's misty  it might be raining  and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner.  Laughter  That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini  and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan  though it is not the same in detail  is every bit as fascinating as that story is. And for us  it has been like    the Cassini people    it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true. As I said  it has a thick  extensive atmosphere. This is a picture of Titan  backlit by the Sun  with the rings as a beautiful backdrop. And yet another moon there    I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere. We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere  and my camera system is one of them. And we have taken pictures like this. And what you see is bright and dark regions  and that's about as far as it got for us. It was so mystifying  we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan. When you look closer at this region  you start to see things like sinuous channels    we didn't know. You see a few round things. This  we later found out  is  in fact  a crater  but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan  meaning it's a very young surface. And there are features that look tectonic. They look like they've been pulled apart. Whenever you see anything linear on a planet  it means there's been a fracture  like a fault. And so it's been tectonically altered. But we couldn't make sense of our images  until  six months after we got into orbit  an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan. And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe  the European built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan  it took two and a half hours to descend  and it landed on the surface. And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is. This is a device of human making  and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history. It is so significant that  in my mind  this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe  and sadly  that wasn't the case. It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission  and this event was celebrated in Europe  in Germany  and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents  and American accents  and German accents  and French and Italian and Dutch accents. It was a moving demonstration of what the words  united nations  are supposed to mean  a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good. And  in this case  it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet  and to come to understand a planetary system that  for all of human history  had been unreachable  and now humans had actually touched it. So it was    I mean  I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it. It was a tremendously emotional event  and it's something that I will personally never forget  and you shouldn't either. But anyway  the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down  and it also took panoramic pictures. And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw. And it was a shocker  because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be. It was an unambiguous pattern  a geological pattern. It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids. And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge. And they converge into this channel here  which drains into this region. You are looking at a shoreline. Was this a shoreline of fluids  We didn't know. But this is somewhat of a shoreline. This picture is taken at    kilometers. This is the picture taken at eight kilometers  OK  Again  the shoreline. Okay  now     kilometers  eight kilometers    this is roughly an airline altitude. If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.  you would be flying at these altitudes. So  this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.  Laughter  And then finally  the probe came to rest on the surface  and I'm going to show you  ladies and gentlemen  the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system. And here is the horizon  OK  These are probably water ice pebbles  yes  And obviously  it landed in one of these flat  dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in. What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat. This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane. And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw  and has drained over billions of years to fill in low lying basins. And that is what the Huygens probe landed in. But still  there was no sign in our images  or even in the Huygens' images  of any large  open bodies of fluids. Where were they  It got even more puzzling when we found dunes. OK  so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan  showing these dunes. These are dunes that are     meters tall  separated by a few kilometers  and they go on for miles and miles and miles. There's hundreds  up to a       or       miles of dunes. This is the Saharan desert of Titan. It's obviously a place which is very dry  or you wouldn't get dunes. So again  it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid  until finally  we saw lakes in the polar regions. And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan. It's about the size of Lake Ontario. And then  only a week and a half ago  we flew over the north pole of Titan and found  again  we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea. So it seems that the liquids  for some reason we don't understand  or during at least this season  are apparently at the poles of Titan. And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable  mystical place. It's exotic  it's alien  but yet strangely Earth like  and having Earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity  and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself. And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon  it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England  just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat. And Enceladus is very white  it's very bright  and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures. It is a very geologically active body. But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole    and we're looking at the south pole here    where we found this system of fractures. And they're a different color because they're a different composition. They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials. Moreover  this whole  entire region  the south polar region  has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet  on the body. That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics. And then  when we took additional pictures  we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine  icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space. And when we color code this image  to bring out the faint light levels  we see that these jets feed a plume that  in fact  we see  in other images  goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus. My team and I have examined images like this  and like this one  and have thought about the other results from Cassini. And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus. So we have  possibly  liquid water  organic materials and excess heat. In other words  we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration  or in other words  an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms. And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system  whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere  would have enormous cultural and scientific implications. Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once  but twice  independently  in our solar system  then that means  by inference  it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its   .  billion year history. Right now  Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life. It is precious  it is unique  it is still  so far  the only home we've ever known. And if any of you were alert and coherent during the     s    and we'd forgive you  if you weren't  OK    you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo   astronauts in     . It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space  and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe  and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet. Well  we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first  a picture that no human eye has ever seen before. It is a total eclipse of the Sun  seen from the other side of Saturn. And in this impossibly beautiful picture  you see the main rings backlit by the Sun  you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created  in fact  by the exhalations of Enceladus. But as if that weren't brilliant enough  we can spot  in this beautiful image  sight of our own planet  cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings. Now  there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar  and capturing the sight of our little  blue ocean planet in the skies of other worlds. And that  and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that  may be  in the end  the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago. And thank you very much. Chris Anderson  Welcome to TED. Richard Branson  Thank you very much. The first TED has been great. CA  Have you met anyone interesting  RB  Well  the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting. I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn  because I had an apology to make to her. I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd    she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off. And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big  massive  big wedding ring on my finger. And  anyway  the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off. So     Laughter     so apologies to Goldie. CA  That's pretty good. So  we're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here. You've started one or two in your time. So  you know  Virgin Atlantic  Virgin Records    I guess it all started with a magazine called Student. And then  yes  all these other ones as well. I mean  how do you do this  RB  I read all these sort of TED instructions  you must not talk about your own business  and this  and now you ask me. So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage  since you asked the question. CA  It depends what the answer is though. RB  No  I mean  I think I learned early on that if you can run one company  you can really run any companies. I mean  companies are all about finding the right people  inspiring those people  you know  drawing out the best in people. And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on  you know  the status quo and trying to turn it upside down. So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see    you know  if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one  which it wasn't     years ago  then I'd think  well  you know  maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on. And so  you know  so got one secondhand     from Boeing and gave it a go. CA  Well  that was a bizarre thing  because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy. And in fact  in a way  it almost took down your empire at one point. I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who  at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic  and his view was that you were trading  you know  the world's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind. Why did you do that  RB  Well  I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing  you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line. We had    we were being attacked by British Airways. They were trying to put our airline out of business  and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign. And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip. And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline  and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company  I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline. CA  Post Napster  you're looking like a bit of a genius  actually  for that as well. RB  Yeah  as it turned out  it proved to be the right move. But  yeah  it was sad at the time  but we moved on. CA  Now  you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other. What does the brand stand for in your head  RB  Well  I like to think it stands for quality  that you know  if somebody comes across a Virgin company  they    CA  They are quality  Richard. Come on now  everyone says quality. Spirit  RB  No  but I was going to move on this. We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it. As I say  we go in and shake up other industries  and I think  you know  we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market. CA  I mean  there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well. I mean  Virgin Brides    what happened there  RB  We couldn't find any customers. CA  I was actually also curious why    I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates. I mean  couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well  Ain't virgin no longer  or something. RB  Again  we may have had problems finding customers. I mean  we had    often  when you launch a company and you get customer complaints  you know  you can deal with them. But about three months after the launch of the condom company  I had a letter  a complaint  and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely. But obviously  there wasn't a lot I could do about it. And then six months later  or nine months after the problem had taken  I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I'd be godfather  which I became. So  it all worked out well. CA  Really  You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful. RB  I should have. CA  So  just help us with some of the numbers. I mean  what are the numbers on this  I mean  how big is the group overall  How much    what's the total revenue  RB  It's about    billion dollars now  in total. CA  And how many employees  RB  About       . CA  So  you've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that. What was that  Was that real  RB  Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles  I think. No  I mean  I think    CA  But is that your hair  RB  No. CA  What was that one  RB  Dropping in for tea. CA  OK. RB  Ah  that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car boat in which    CA  Oh  that car that we    actually we    it was a TEDster event there  I think. Is that    could you still pause on that one actually  for a minute  RB  It's a tough job  isn't it  CA  I mean  it is a tough job. When I first came to America  I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of    they have these different rules over here  it's very strange. RB  I know  I have    the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that  but    CA  I mean  speaking of which  tell us about    RB   Pammy  we launched  you know    mistakenly thought we could take on Coca Cola  and we launched a cola bottle called  The Pammy  and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson. But the trouble is  it kept on tipping over  but    CA  Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps  RB  Of course. CA  So  we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice. And  OK  so stop there. This was    you had some award I think  RB  Yeah  well     years earlier  we'd launched the Sex Pistols'  God Save The Queen   and I'd certainly never expected that    years later    that she'd actually knight us. But somehow  she must have had a forgetful memory  I think. CA  Well  God saved her and you got your just reward. Do you like to be called Sir Richard  or how  RB  Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard. Occasionally in America  I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place. But nowhere else anyway. CA  OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ... RB  No. I suppose if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something  that might be worth using it. CA  You know  it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson. RB  I'll go get the secretary to use it. CA  OK. So let's look at the space thing. I think  with us  we've got a video that shows what you're up to  and Virgin Galactic up in the air.  Video  So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship  RB  Yeah  it'll be ready in    well  ready in    months and then we do    months extensive testing. And then    months from now  people will be able to take a ride into space. CA  So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed  RB  Philippe has done the    yeah  quite a bit of it  the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico. And basically  he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye  so when you're in space  you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you. And when you land  you'll be able to go back into this giant eye. But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design. CA  But you didn't have him design the engine  RB  Philippe is quite erratic  so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine  no. CA  He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago. RB  Yeah  No  he is a    CA  Well  some people found it wonderful  some people found it completely bizarre. But  I personally found it wonderful. RB  He's a wonderful enthusiast  which is why I love him. But ... CA  So  now  you've always had this exploration bug in you. Have you ever regretted that  RB  Many times. I mean  I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past. Well  I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters  so    and each time  I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale. So in those moments  you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or    CA  What was the closest you got to    when did you think  this is it  I might be on my way out  RB  Well  I think the balloon adventures were    each one was  each one  actually  I think we came close. And  I mean  first of all we    nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before  so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream  and we weren't quite sure  when a balloon actually got into the jet stream  whether it would actually survive the          miles an hour winds that you can find up there. And so  just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic  as we were pushing into the jet stream  this enormous balloon    the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour  the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour  and it just took off. And it was like holding onto a thousand horses. And we were just crossing every finger  praying that the balloon would hold together  which  fortunately  it did. But the ends of all those balloon trips were  you know    something seemed to go wrong every time  and on that particular occasion  the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped  and left me holding on for dear life. CA  Did he tell you to jump  or he just said   I'm out of here   and ... RB  No  he told me jump  but once his weight had gone  the balloon just shot up to        feet and I ... CA  And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that. RB  Yeah. No  I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon  with my parachute  looking at the swirling clouds below  trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea  which    and it was a very  very  very lonely few moments. But  anyway  we managed to survive it. CA  Did you jump  Or it came down in the end  RB  Well  I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left  and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped  I would only have a couple of minutes of life left. So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision. And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again  looked down at those clouds again  climbed back into the capsule again. And then finally  just thought  there's a better way. I've got  you know  this enormous balloon above me  it's the biggest parachute ever  why not use it  And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds  and about    feet  before I hit the sea  threw myself over. And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to        feet without me. But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and    CA  What did you write to your family  RB  Just what you would do in a situation like that  just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip  which    just in case anything had happened. But fortunately  they never had to use it. CA  Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics. The years    and until I stopped looking at the polls  you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere. And cynics might say  you know  this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing. How much was the PR value part of this  RB  Well  of course  the PR experts said that as an airline owner  the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats  and crashing into the seas. CA  They have a point  Richard. RB  In fact  I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying  you know  come on  Richard  there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic. CA  To do all this  you must have been a genius from the get go  right  RB  Well  I won't contradict that. CA  OK  this isn't exactly hardball. OK. Didn't    weren't you just terrible at school  RB  I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever. I certainly would have failed IQ tests. And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was    years old. And if I    if I'm not interested in something  I don't grasp it. As somebody who's dyslexic  you also have some quite bizarre situations. I mean  for instance  I've had to    you know  I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe  but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross. And so the board meetings have been fascinating. And so  it's like  good news or bad news  And generally  the people would say  oh  well that's bad news. CA  But just to clarify  the    billion dollars is gross  right  That's gross  RB  Well  I hope it's net actually  having    I've got it right. CA  No  trust me  it's gross. RB  So  when I turned     somebody took me outside the boardroom and said   Look Richard  here's a    let me draw on a diagram. Here's a net in the sea  and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net. And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net  everything else is eaten.  And I finally worked it all out. CA  But  I mean  at school    so as well as being  you know  doing pretty miserably academically  but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams. So you were kind of a    you were a natural leader  but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then  or how would you ... RB  Yeah  I think I was a bit of a maverick and    but I ... And I was  yeah  I was fortunately good at sport  and so at least I had something to excel at  at school. CA  And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life. I mean  there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field  aged four  and saying  OK  walk home.  Did this really happen  RB  She was  you know  she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age. So she did things to us  which now she'd be arrested for  such as pushing us out of the car  and telling us to find our own way to Granny's  about five miles before we actually got there. And making us go on wonderful  long bike rides. And we were never allowed to watch television and the like. CA  But is there a risk here  I mean  there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy  and they've got kids  and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up. Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they're too coddled  they don't know what they've got  we're going to raise a generation of privileged ... RB  No  I think if you're bringing up kids  you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm. So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really. CA  You didn't turn out too bad  I have to say  I'm ... Your headmaster said to you    I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school    he said  you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison  and I'm not sure which. Which of those happened first  RB  Well  I've done both. I think I went to prison first. I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K. I was prosecuted under the      Venereal Diseases Act and the      Indecent Advertisements Act. On the first occasion  for mentioning the word venereal disease in public  which    we had a center where we would help young people who had problems. And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease. And there's an ancient law that says you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public. So the police knocked on the door  and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease. We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots  but nobody came with VD any more. So  we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested. And then subsequently   Never Mind the Bollocks  Here's the Sex Pistols   the word bollocks  the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album. And John Mortimer  the playwright  defended us. And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks. And so I rang up Nottingham University  and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics. And he said   Look  bollocks is not a    has nothing to do with balls whatsoever. It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century.  And he went   Furthermore  I'm a priest myself.  And so I said   Would you mind coming to the court   And he said he'd be delighted. And I said    and he said   Would you like me to wear my dog collar   And I said   Yes  definitely. Please.  CA  That's great. RB  So our key witness argued that it was actually  Never Mind the Priest  Here's the Sex Pistols.  And the judge found us    reluctantly found us not guilty  so ... CA  That is outrageous. So seriously  is there a dark side  A lot of people would say there's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back  you know  doing some ugly things. You've been accused of being ruthless. There was a nasty biography written about you by someone. Is any of it true  Is there an element of truth in it  RB  I don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top  generally speaking  works. I think if you treat people well  people will come back and come back for more. And I think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world. And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well  and I like to think that's how we run Virgin. CA  And what about the people who love you and who see you spending    you keep getting caught up in these new projects  but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff. You get excited by an idea and  kapow  I mean  do you think about life balance  How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new  RB  I also believe that being a father's incredibly important  so from the time the kids were very young  you know  when they go on holiday  I go on holiday with them. And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together. Yes  I'll  you know  be in touch. We're very lucky  we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can    so I can take them there and we can bring friends  and we can play together  but I can also keep in touch with what's going on. CA  You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy. What is that  RB  Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works. You know  the alternative  communism  has not worked. But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people  and therefore extreme responsibility  I think  goes with that wealth. And I think it's important that the individuals  who are in that fortunate position  do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats  and bigger and bigger cars  but  you know  use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world. CA  And what are the issues that you worry about most  care most about  want to turn your resources toward  RB  Well  there's    I mean there's a lot of issues. I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into  A  trying to come up with alternative fuels and  B  you know  we just launched this prize  which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels  in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly  and in case we go through the tipping point. We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere. And we just    you know  there weren't really people working on that before  so we wanted people to try to    all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that  and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth's atmosphere as well. And actually  we've had about        people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go. And so we only need one  so we're hopeful. CA  And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects  RB  Yes  I mean  we've got    we're setting up something called the war room  which is maybe the wrong word. We're trying to    maybe we'll change it    but anyway  it's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa  all the different social problems in Africa  and try to look at best practices. So  for instance  there's a doctor in Africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at    weeks  when she's pregnant  that the baby will not have HIV when it's born. And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important. CA  The war room sounds  it sounds powerful and dramatic. And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about    I mean  they're used to having an idea  getting stuff done  and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world. Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say  we've got to fix this problem and we can do it  I've got all these billions of dollars  you know  da  da  da    here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that  RB  Well  first of all  on this particular situation  we're actually    we're working with the government on it. I mean  Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related  but this is a way  I think  of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him  it's a way of working with him  with his government. It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help  they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years. It's got to be consistent. But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know how and help governments approach things slightly differently. For instance  we're setting up clinics in Africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs  free TB treatment and free malaria treatment. But we're also trying to make them self sustaining clinics  so that people pay for some other aspects. CA  I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself  or Bill Gates  or whatever  that this is really being    it's almost driven by some sort of desire again  you know  for the right image  for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct. What would you say to them  RB  Well  I think that everybody    people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that  you know  when I'm on me deathbed  I will want to feel that I've made a difference to other people's lives. And that may be a selfish thing to think  but it's the way I've been brought up. I think if I'm in a position to radically change other people's lives for the better  I should do so. CA  How old are you  RB  I'm   . CA  I mean  the psychologist Erik Erikson says that    as I understand him and I'm a total amateur    but that during   s    s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.   s    s  the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy. I mean  it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases  you're still doing these incredible new plans. How much do you think about legacy  and what would you like your legacy to be  RB  I don't think I think too much about legacy. I mean  I like to    you know  my grandmother lived to      so hopefully I've got another    or    years to go. No  I just want to live life to its full. You know  if I can make a difference  I hope to be able to make a difference. And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got Sergey and Larry from Google  for instance  who are good friends. And  thank God  you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth. If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world  it would be very worrying. And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world. And I think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference. CA  Well  Richard  when I was starting off in business  I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of    I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding. And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you  I thought  well  he's made it. Maybe there is a different way. So I would like to thank you for that inspiration  and for coming to TED today. Thank you. Thank you so much. So  where are the robots  We've been told for    years already that they're coming soon. Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. They'll be cooking  cleaning  buying things  shopping  building. But they aren't here. Meanwhile  we have illegal immigrants doing all the work  but we don't have any robots. So what can we do about that  What can we say  So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way. And this is an x ray picture of a real beetle  and a Swiss watch  back from '  . You look at that    what was true then is certainly true today. We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces. We can make the circuitry of the right computational power  but we can't actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems. So let's try to look at it from a different perspective. Let's summon the best designer  the mother of all designers. Let's see what evolution can do for us. So we threw in    we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots    with bars  with motors  with neurons. Put them all together  and put all this under kind of natural selection  under mutation  and rewarded things for how well they can move forward. A very simple task  and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that. So if you look  you can see a lot of different machines come out of this. They all move around. They all crawl in different ways  and you can see on the right  that we actually made a couple of these things  and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots  but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for  for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation  but we can also do that on a real machine. Here's a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains  competing  or evolving on the machine. It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine  and they get rewarded for how fast or how far they can make the machine move forward. And you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet  but they gradually learn how to move forward  and they do this autonomously. So in these two examples  we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation  and also machines that learned how to walk in reality. But I want to show you a different approach  and this is this robot over here  which has four legs. It has eight motors  four on the knees and four on the hip. It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting. But this machine doesn't know what it looks like. You look at it and you see it has four legs  the machine doesn't know if it's a snake  if it's a tree  it doesn't have any idea what it looks like  but it's going to try to find that out. Initially  it does some random motion  and then it tries to figure out what it might look like. And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds  a lot of self models that try to explain the relationship between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do a second action that creates the most disagreement among predictions of these alternative models  like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that and tries to explain that  and prune out its self models. This is the last cycle  and you can see it's pretty much figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self model  it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion. So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines    a pattern of locomotion. We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil  spidery walk  but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward. But when you look at that  you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward  nor did it have a model of itself. It kind of figured out what it looks like  and how to move forward  and then actually tried that out. So  we'll move forward to a different idea. So that was what happened when we had a couple of    that's what happened when you had a couple of    OK  OK  OK       they don't like each other. So there's a different robot. That's what happened when the robots actually are rewarded for doing something. What happens if you don't reward them for anything  you just throw them in  So we have these cubes  like the diagram showed here. The cube can swivel  or flip on its side  and we just throw       of these cubes into a soup    this is in simulation   and don't reward them for anything  we just let them flip. We pump energy into this and see what happens in a couple of mutations. So  initially nothing happens  they're just flipping around there. But after a very short while  you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over. They begin to self replicate. So in absence of any reward  the intrinsic reward is self replication. And we've actually built a couple of these  and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes. It's an accelerated view  where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process. So you're feeding it with more material    cubes in this case    and more energy  and it can make another robot. So of course  this is a very crude machine  but we're working on a micro scale version of these  and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. OK  so what can we learn  These robots are of course not very useful in themselves  but they might teach us something about how we can build better robots  and perhaps how humans  animals  create self models and learn. And one of the things that I think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually  but actually let them evolve and learn  like children  and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you. What I am always thinking about is what this session is about  which is called simplicity. And almost  I would almost call it being simple minded  but in the best sense of the word. I'm trying to figure out two very simple things  how to live and how to die  period. That's all I'm trying to do  all day long. And I'm also trying to have some meals  and have some snacks  and  you know  and yell at my children  and do all the normal things that keep you grounded. So  I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child. My older sister was busy torturing my parents  and they were busy torturing her. I was lucky enough to be completely ignored  which is a fabulous thing  actually  I want to tell you. So  I was able to completely daydream my way through my life. And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU  at a very good time  in       where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU. And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him. And feminists hated us  and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end. But I kept writing bad poetry  and he didn't blow up the math building  but he went to Cuba. But I gave him the money  because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did. And that was a good thing to help  you know  the cause. But  then he came back  and things happened  and I decided I really hated my writing  that it was awful  awful  purple prose. And I decided that I wanted to tell    but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories. So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be  And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through  you know  sheer whatever  sheer ignorance. And we started a studio. Well  Tibor really started the studio  called M Co. And the premise of M Co was  we don't know anything  but that's all right  we're going to do it anyway. And as a matter of fact  it's better not to know anything  because if you know too much  you're stymied. So  the premise in the studio was  there are no boundaries  there is no fear. And I    and my full time job  I landed the best job on Earth  was to daydream  and to actually come up with absurd ideas that    fortunately  there were enough people there  and it was a team  it was a collective  it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas. But the point was that I was there as myself  as a dreamer. And so some of the things    I mean  it was a long history of M Co  and clearly we also needed to make some money  so we decided we would create a series of products. And some of the watches there  attempting to be beautiful and humorous    maybe not attempting  hopefully succeeding. That to be able to talk about content  to break apart what you normally expect  to use humor and surprise  elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us. It was a very high  it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say  the content is what's important  not the package  not the wrapping. You really have to be journalists  you have to be inventors  you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything. So  the good news is that I have a dog and  though I don't know if I believe in luck    I don't know what I believe in  it's a very complicated question  but I do know that before I go away  I crank his tail seven times. So  whenever he sees a suitcase in the house  because everybody's always  you know  leaving  they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail  and he runs to the other room. But I am able to make the transition from working for children and    from working for adults to children  and back and forth  because  you know  I can say that I'm immature  and in a way  that's true. I don't really    I mean  I could tell you that I didn't understand  I'm not proud of it  but I didn't understand let's say    percent of the talks at this conference. But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell Mann's talk. And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk. So  good things come out of  you know  incomprehension       which I will do a painting of  and then it will end up in my work. So  I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new. So  in writing for children  it seems simple  and it is. You have to condense a story into    pages  usually. And what you have to do is  you really have to edit down to what you want to say. And hopefully  you're not talking down to kids and you're not talking in such a way that you  you know  couldn't stand reading it after one time. So  I hopefully am writing  you know  books that are good for children and for adults. But the painting reflects    I don't think differently for children than I do for adults. I try to use the same kind of imagination  the same kind of whimsy  the same kind of love of language. So  you know  and I have lots of wonderful looking friends. This is Andrew Gatz  and he walked in through the door and I said   You  Sit down there.  You know  I take lots of photos. And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair. So  I get to put in all of the things that I love. Hopefully  a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels  and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve. And the books are really journals of my life. I never    I don't like plots. I don't know what a plot means. I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning  you know  beginning  middle and end. It really scares me  because my life is too random and too confused  and I enjoy it that way. But anyway  so we were in Venice  and this is our room. And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown  and I was looking out the window  and it was really a beautiful thing. And so  I was able to put that into this story  which is an alphabet  and hopefully go on to something else. The letter C had other things in it. I was fortunate also  to meet the man who's sitting on the bed  though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair. Well  he has some hair but    well  he used to have hair. And with him  I was able to do a project that was really fantastic. I work for the New Yorker  and I do covers  and      happened and it was  you know  a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it. And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx  and somebody said Bronxistan  and somebody said Ferreristan  and we came up with this New Yorker cover  which we were able to    we didn't know what we were doing. We weren't trying to be funny  we weren't trying to be    well  we were trying to be funny actually  that's not true. We hoped we'd be funny  but we didn't know it would be a cover  and we didn't know that that image  at the moment that it happened  would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people. And it really became the    I don't know  you know  it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on. And from  you know  Fattushis  to Taxistan to  you know  for the Fashtoonks  Botoxia  Pashmina  Khlintunisia  you know  we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign  who are    what's going on over here  Who are these people  What are these tribes  And David Remnick  who was really wonderful about it  had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers  because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's. But you know  we said   David  who's going to know  They're not.  So it stayed in  and it was  and  you know  it was a good thing. You know  in the course of my life  I never know what's going to happen and that's kind of the beauty part. And we were on Cape Cod  a place  obviously  of great inspiration  and I picked up this book   The Elements of Style   at a yard sale. And I didn't    and I'd never used it in school  because I was too busy writing poems  and flunking out  and I don't know what  sitting in cafes. But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought  this book is amazing. I said  people should know about this book. So I decided it needed a few    it needed a lift  it needed a few illustrations. And basically  I called the  you know  I convinced the White Estate  and what an intersection of like  you know  Polish Jew  you know  main WASP family. Here I am  saying  I'd like to do something to this book. And they said yes  and they left me completely alone  which was a gorgeous  wonderful thing. And I took the examples that they gave  and just did    paintings  basically. So  this is  I don't know if you can read this.  Well  Susan  this is a fine mess you are in.  And when you're dealing with grammar  which is  you know  incredibly dry  E.B. White wrote such wonderful  whimsical    and actually  Strunk    and then you come to the rules and  you know  there are lots of grammar things.  Do you mind me asking a question  Do you mind my asking a question    Would  could  should  or would  should  could.  And  would  is Coco Chanel's lover   should  is Edith Sitwell  and  could  is an August Sander subject. And   He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug.  So  there's a kind of British understatement  murder mystery theme that I really love very much. And then   Be obscure clearly  Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand.  E.B. White wrote us a number of rules  which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time  or you can ignore them  which I do  or you can  I don't know what  you know  eat a sandwich. So  what I did when I was painting was I started singing  because I really adore singing  and I think that music is the highest form of all art. So  I commissioned a wonderful composer  Nico Muhly  who wrote nine songs using the text  and we performed this fantastic evening of    he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals. I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library  where you're supposed to be very  very quiet  and it was a phenomenally wonderful event  which we hopefully will do some more. Who knows  The New York TimesSelect  the op ed page  asked me to do a column  and they said  you can do whatever you want. So  once a month for the last year  I've been doing a column called  The Principles of Uncertainty   which  you know  I don't know who Heisenberg is  but I know I can throw that around now. You know  it's the principles of uncertainty  so  you know. I'm going to read quickly    and probably I'm going to edit some  because I don't have that much time left    a few of the columns. And basically  I was so  you know  it was so amusing  because I said   Well  how much space do I have   And they said   Well  you know  it's the Internet.  And I said   Yes  but how much space do I have   And they said   It's unlimited  it's unlimited.  OK. So  the first one I was very timid  and I'll begin.  How can I tell you everything that is in my heart  Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo.  And I talk about the dodo  and how the dodo became extinct  and then I talk about Spinoza.  As the last dodo was dying  Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything  called eudaemonia. And then he breathed his last  with loved ones around him  and I know that he had chicken soup also  as his last meal.  I happen to know it for a fact. And then he died  and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct. And then  we don't have a stuffed Spinoza  but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog  and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg  in Russia. And there he is  with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic  decrepit palace.  And I think it must have been a very  very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived. Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs  but Stalin was a paranoid man  even more than my father.  You don't even know.  And decided his top people had to be extinctified.  Which I think I made up  which is a good thing. And so  this is a chart of  you know  just a small chart  because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed. So  shot dead  smacked over the head  you know  thrown away.  Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov  sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair  leafing through a book and butterflies  imagine such displacement  such loss   And then I want to tell you that this is a map. So   My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well. Too many pogroms. Leaving the shack  the wild blueberry woods  the geese  the River Sluch  they went to Palestine and then America.  And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America  and that is my DNA over here  because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever. Facts were actually banished from our home. And so  if you see that Texas    you know  Texas and California are under Canada  and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina  this is the home that I grew up in  OK  So  it's a miracle that I'm here today. But actually  it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing. But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin  which is the town they came from  and   Sorry  the rest unknown  thank you.  But in her lexicon   sorry  the rest unknown  thank you  is  sorry  the rest unknown  go to hell   because she couldn't care less.  The Impossibility of February  is that February's a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things. Well  not so awful. I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead. And I say   I hope he's not really dead  just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow  but the caption says he is dead.  And actually  he was. I think he's dead  though I don't know  maybe he's not dead.  And this woman leans over in anguish  not about that man  but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February.  There's consoling. This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase  and basically    you know  I guess onions are a theme here. And he says   It is impossible not to lie. It is February and not lying is impossible.  And I really spend a lot of time wondering  how much truth do we tell  What is it that we're actually    what story are we actually telling  How do we know when we are ourselves  How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories  you know  are real sentences  Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying  I'm going to quickly go through this. A quote by Bertrand Russell   All the labor of all the ages  all the devotion  all the inspiration  all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction. So now  my friends  if that is true  and it is true  what is the point   A complicated question. And so  you know  I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs. Oh my God  you know what  Could we have    no  we don't have time. I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the    you know  could we have it for a second  Do you have that  OK. I taped my    my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about   . So    and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because  you know  we're from Russia. I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart  and she is     and when I brought her a copy of  The Elements of Style   she said she would treasure it. And then I said    oh  and she was talking about Moss Hart  and I said   When you met him  you knew it was him.  And she said   I knew it was he.  So  I was the one who should have kept the book  but it was a really wonderful moment. And she dated George Gershwin  so  you know  get out. Gershwin died at the age of   . He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband. I don't want to talk about that now. I do want to talk    the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby. I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate. And I would like to run it for them. And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise  who's also still working  and I looked at her sink  which is really amazing  and left. And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street. And a woman who lives on our street  Lolita. And then I go and have some tea. And then my Aunt Frances dies  and before she died  she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel. And I wonder what the point is and then I know  and I see that Hy Meyerowitz  Rick Meyerowitz's father  a dry cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx  won the Charlie Chaplin look alike contest in     . That's actually Hy. And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit  and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine. And it says   Ich habe genug   which is a Bach cantata  which I once thought meant  I've had it  I can't take it anymore  give me a break   but I was wrong. It means  I have enough.  And that is utterly true. I happen to be alive  end of discussion. Thank you. I live and work from Tokyo  Japan. And I specialize in human behavioral research  and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways  and to design for that future. And you know  to be honest  I've been doing this for seven years  and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like. But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there. This is my office. It's out there. It's not in the lab  and it's increasingly in places like India  China  Brazil  Africa. We live on a planet     .  billion people. About three billion people  by the end of this year  will have cellular connectivity. And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that. And I mention this because  if we want to design for that future  we need to figure out what those people are about. And that's  kind of  where I see what my job is and what our team's job is. Our research often starts with a very simple question. So I'll give you an example. What do you carry  If you think of everything in your life that you own  when you walk out that door  what do you consider to take with you  When you're looking around  what do you consider  Of that stuff  what do you carry  And of that stuff  what do you actually use  So this is interesting to us  because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual  emotional or functional value. And to put it really bluntly  you know  people are willing to pay for stuff that has value  right  So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry. I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets  purses. I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide  and we follow them around town with video cameras. It's kind of like stalking with permission. And we do all this    and to go back to the original question  what do people carry  And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff. OK  that's fair enough. But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are    across cultures and across gender and across contexts    most people will say keys  money and  if they own one  a mobile phone. And I'm not saying this is a good thing  but this is a thing  right  I mean  I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to. You'd probably kick me out  or something. OK  it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask. But really  the question is  why  Right  So why are these things so important in our lives  And it turns out  from our research  that it boils down to survival    survival for us and survival for our loved ones. So  keys provide an access to shelter and warmth    transport as well  in the U.S. increasingly. Money is useful for buying food  sustenance  among all its other uses. And a mobile phone  it turns out  is a great recovery tool. If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs  those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Yes  they do a whole bunch of other stuff  but they're very good at this. And in particular  it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time. And what I mean by that is  you know  you can transcend space by simply making a voice call  right  And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience  and someone else can pick it up at their convenience. And this is fairly universally appreciated  it turns out  which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected. And they value that connectivity. But actually  you can do this kind of stuff with PCs. And you can do them with phone kiosks. And the mobile phone  in addition  is both personal    and so it also gives you a degree of privacy    and it's convenient. You don't need to ask permission from anyone  you can just go ahead and do it  right  However  for these things to help us survive  it depends on them being carried. But    and it's a pretty big but    we forget. We're human  that's what we do. It's one of our features. I think  quite a nice feature. So we forget  but we're also adaptable  and we adapt to situations around us pretty well. And so we have these strategies to remember  and one of them was mentioned yesterday. And it's  quite simply  the point of reflection. And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space  and you turn around  and quite often you tap your pockets. Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets. And you turn around  and you look back into the space  and some people talk aloud. And pretty much everyone does it at some point. OK  the next thing is    most of you  if you have a stable home life  and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time  and always in hotels  but most people have what we call a center of gravity. And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects. And these things don't stay in the center of gravity  but over time  they gravitate there. It's where you expect to find stuff. And in fact  when you're turning around  and you're looking inside the house  and you're looking for this stuff  this is where you look first  right  OK  so when we did this research  we found the absolutely      percent  guaranteed way to never forget anything ever  ever again. And that is  quite simply  to have nothing to remember. OK  now  that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie  right  But is  in fact  about the art of delegation. And from a design perspective  it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people. And it turns out  delegation    if you want it to be    can be the solution for pretty much everything  apart from things like bodily functions  going to the toilet. You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf. And apart from things like entertainment  you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf  or  at least  not yet. Maybe sometime in the future  we will. So  let me give you an example of delegation in practice  right. So this is    probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate. So  the U.N. estimated    this is      figures    that there are almost     million people who can't read and write  worldwide. So  we've been conducting a lot of research. And one of the things we were looking at is    if you can't read and write  if you want to communicate over distances  you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with. It could be a phone number  it could be an e mail address  it could be a postal address. Simple question  if you can't read and write  how do you manage your contact information  And the fact is that millions of people do it. Just from a design perspective  we didn't really understand how they did it  and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing. And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation. So they delegate that part of the task process to other people  the stuff that they can't do themselves. Let me give you another example of delegation. This one's a little bit more sophisticated  and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices  use those devices. Sente is a word in Uganda that means money. It has a second meaning  which is to send money as airtime. OK  And it works like this. So let's say  June  you're in a village  rural village. I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner. I'm sending money back  and it works like this. So  in your village  there's one person in the village with a phone  and that's the phone kiosk operator. And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk. So what I do is  I buy a prepaid card like this. And instead of using that money to top up my own phone  I call up the local village operator. And I read out that number to them  and they use it to top up their phone. So  they're topping up the value from Kampala  and it's now being topped up in the village. You take a    or    percent commission  and then you    the kiosk operator takes    or    percent commission  and passes the rest over to you in cash. OK  there's two things I like about this. So the first is  it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone    anyone who has a mobile phone    essentially into an ATM machine. It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure. And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure  they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers  because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts. There's a second thing I like about this. And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal  and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication  I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK  And  yes  there are things like Grameen Bank and micro lending. But the difference between this and that is  there's no central authority trying to control this. This is just street up innovation. So  it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us. And OK  if you break one of these things here  you return it to the carrier. They'll give you a new one. They'll probably give you three new ones  right  I mean  that's buy three  get one free. That kind of thing. If you go on the streets of India and China  you see this kind of stuff. And this is where they take the stuff that breaks  and they fix it  and they put it back into circulation. This is from a workbench in Jilin City  in China  and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together. They reverse engineer manuals. This is a kind of hacker's manual  and it's written in Chinese and English. They also write them in Hindi. You can subscribe to these. There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well. But what I like about this is  it boils down to someone on the street with a small  flat surface  a screwdriver  a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads    because they often get dust on the contact heads    and knowledge. And it's all about the social network of the knowledge  floating around. And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff  and build stuff  and potentially distribute stuff. It challenges the norms. OK  for me the street just raises so many different questions. Like  this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China. And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes. And I know what you're asking    did I test it  I'm not going to answer that  OK. But I look at something like this  and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process. And we look at this and we think  well  how does that apply  for example  for the design of    the lessons from this    apply to the design of online services  future services in these markets  This is a pair of underpants from    from Tibet. And I look at something like this  and honestly  you know  why would someone design underpants with a pocket  right  And I look at something like this and it makes me question  if we were to take all the functionality in things like this  and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network  how would we prioritize where to put stuff  And yes  this is quite trivial  but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks. And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda. This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers. So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile  When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile  it isn't fixed  Your notion of identity is out of date already  OK  for those extra three billion people. This is how it's shifting. And then I go to this picture here  which is the one that I started with. And this is from Delhi. It's from a study we did into illiteracy  and it's a guy in a teashop. You can see the chai being poured in the background. And he's a  you know  incredibly poor teashop worker  on the lowest rungs in the society. And he  somehow  has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong. And it's not necessarily the same values  but some kind of values of Livestrong  to actually go out and purchase them  and actually display them. For me  this kind of personifies this connected world  where everything is intertwined  and the dots are    it's all about the dots joining together. OK  the title of this presentation is  Connections and Consequences   and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner  right  When everyone's connected. And there are four things. So  the first thing is the immediacy of ideas  the speed at which ideas go around. And I know TED is about big ideas  but actually  the benchmark for a big idea is changing. If you want a big idea  you need to embrace everyone on the planet  that's the first thing. The second thing is the immediacy of objects. And what I mean by that is  as these become smaller  as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater    things like banking  identity    these things quite simply move very quickly around the world. And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid  in a way that we just totally cannot conceive  when you get it to  .  billion and the growth in the world's population. The next thing is that  however we design this stuff    carefully design this stuff    the street will take it  and will figure out ways to innovate  as long as it meets base needs    the ability to transcend space and time  for example. And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate. In ways that  despite our resources  they can do it better than us. That's my feeling. And if we're smart  we'll look at this stuff that's going on  and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design. And the last thing is that    actually  the direction of the conversation. With another three billion people connected  they want to be part of the conversation. And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen  essentially. And we need to learn how to listen. So thank you very  very much. Well  as Chris pointed out  I study the human brain  the functions and structure of the human brain. And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails. Here is this mass of jelly  three pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand  and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity. And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self awareness  which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience  of neurology  and hopefully  someday  we'll understand how that happens. OK  so how do you study this mysterious organ  I mean  you have     billion nerve cells  little wisps of protoplasm  interacting with each other  and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness. How does this happen  Well  there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain. One approach  the one we use mainly  is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain  where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain. What then happens is not an across the board reduction in all your mental capacities  a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability. What you get is a highly selective loss of one function  with other functions being preserved intact  and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function. So you can then map function onto structure  and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function. So that's what we're trying to do. So let me give you a few striking examples of this. In fact  I'm giving you three examples  six minutes each  during this talk. The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome. If you look at the first slide there  that's the temporal lobes  frontal lobes  parietal lobes  OK    the lobes that constitute the brain. And if you look  tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes    you can't see it there    is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And that's been called the face area in the brain  because when it's damaged  you can no longer recognize people's faces. You can still recognize them from their voice and say   Oh yeah  that's Joe   but you can't look at their face and know who it is  right  You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror. I mean  you know it's you because you wink and it winks  and you know it's a mirror  but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus. But there's another rare syndrome  so rare  in fact  that very few physicians have heard about it  not even neurologists. This is called the Capgras delusion  and that is a patient  who's otherwise completely normal  has had a head injury  comes out of coma  otherwise completely normal  he looks at his mother and says   This looks exactly like my mother  this woman  but she's an impostor. She's some other woman pretending to be my mother.  Now  why does this happen  Why would somebody    and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects  but when he sees his mother  his delusion kicks in and says  it's not mother. Now  the most common interpretation of this  which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks  is a Freudian view  and that is that this chap    and the same argument applies to women  by the way  but I'll just talk about guys. When you're a little baby  a young baby  you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother. This is the so called Oedipus complex of Freud. I'm not saying I believe this  but this is the standard Freudian view. And then  as you grow up  the cortex develops  and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother. Thank God  or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother. And then what happens is  there's a blow to your head  damaging the cortex  allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge  flaming to the surface  and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother. And you say   My God  if this is my mom  how come I'm being sexually turned on  She's some other woman. She's an impostor.  It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain. This has never made much sense to me  this argument. It's very ingenious  as all Freudian arguments are       but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion  a patient having the same delusion  about his pet poodle. He'll say   Doctor  this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi  but it's some other dog.  Right  Now  you try using the Freudian explanation there. You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans  or some such thing  which is quite absurd  of course. Now  what's really going on  So  to explain this curious disorder  we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain. Normally  visual signals come in  into the eyeballs  go to the visual areas in the brain. There are  in fact     areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision  and after processing all that  the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus  where you perceive faces. There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces. You can call it the face area of the brain  right  I talked about that earlier. Now  when that area's damaged  you lose the ability to see faces  right  But from that area  the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  and that structure  called the amygdala  gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at. Is it prey  Is it predator  Is it mate  Or is it something absolutely trivial  like a piece of lint  or a piece of chalk  or a    I don't want to point to that  but    or a shoe  or something like that  OK  Which you can completely ignore. So if the amygdala is excited  and this is something important  the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system. Your heart starts beating faster. You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to create from muscular exertion. And that's fortunate  because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating. So I can determine  when you're looking at something  whether you're excited or whether you're aroused  or not  OK  And I'll get to that in a minute. So my idea was  when this chap looks at an object  when he looks at his    any object for that matter  it goes to the visual areas and  however  and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus  and you recognize it as a pea plant  or a table  or your mother  for that matter  OK  And then the message cascades into the amygdala  and then goes down the autonomic nervous system. But maybe  in this chap  that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system  the emotional core of the brain  is cut by the accident. So because the fusiform is intact  the chap can still recognize his mother  and says   Oh yeah  this looks like my mother.  But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers  he says   But how come  if it's my mother  I don't experience a warmth   Or terror  as the case may be  Right  And therefore  he says   How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions  This can't be my mother. It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother.  How do you test this  Well  what you do is  if you take any one of you here  and put you in front of a screen  and measure your galvanic skin response  and show pictures on the screen  I can measure how you sweat when you see an object  like a table or an umbrella. Of course  you don't sweat. If I show you a picture of a lion  or a tiger  or a pinup  you start sweating  right  And  believe it or not  if I show you a picture of your mother    I'm talking about normal people    you start sweating. You don't even have to be Jewish. Now  what happens if you show this patient  You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response. Tables and chairs and lint  nothing happens  as in normal people  but when you show him a picture of his mother  the galvanic skin response is flat. There's no emotional reaction to his mother  because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut. So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal  his emotions are normal    he'll laugh  he'll cry  so on and so forth    but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor. It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do  take a bizarre  seemingly incomprehensible  neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong  that  in fact  you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain. By the way  if this patient then goes  and mother phones from an adjacent room    phones him    and he picks up the phone  and he says   Wow  mom  how are you  Where are you   There's no delusion through the phone. Then  she approaches him after an hour  he says   Who are you  You look just like my mother.  OK  The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers  and that's not been cut by the accident. So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother  no problem. When he sees her in person  he says it's an impostor. OK  how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain  Is it nature  genes  or is it nurture  And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb. And you all know what a phantom limb is. When an arm is amputated  or a leg is amputated  for gangrene  or you lose it in war    for example  in the Iraq war  it's now a serious problem    you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm  and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg. In fact  you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body. Believe it or not  even with internal viscera. I've had patients with the uterus removed    hysterectomy    who have a phantom uterus  including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month. And in fact  one student asked me the other day   Do they get phantom PMS   A subject ripe for scientific enquiry  but we haven't pursued that. OK  now the next question is  what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments  One of the things we've found was  about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom. It'll pat his brother on the shoulder  it'll answer the phone when it rings  it'll wave goodbye. These are very compelling  vivid sensations. The patient's not delusional. He knows that the arm is not there  but  nevertheless  it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient. But however  about half the patients  this doesn't happen. The phantom limb    they'll say   But doctor  the phantom limb is paralyzed. It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful. If only I could move it  maybe the pain will be relieved.  Now  why would a phantom limb be paralyzed  It sounds like an oxymoron. But when we were looking at the case sheets  what we found was  these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs  the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury. The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed  was cut  by say  a motorcycle accident. So the patient had an actual arm  which is painful  in a sling for a few months or a year  and then  in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm  the surgeon amputates the arm  and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains  right  And this is a serious clinical problem. Patients become depressed. Some of them are driven to suicide  OK  So  how do you treat this syndrome  Now  why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb  When I looked at the case sheet  I found that they had an actual arm  and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut  and the actual arm had been paralyzed  and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation  and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself. Why does this happen  When the arm was intact  but paralyzed  the brain sends commands to the arm  the front of the brain  saying   Move   but it's getting visual feedback saying   No.  Move. No. Move. No. Move. No. And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain  and we call this learned paralysis  OK  The brain learns  because of this Hebbian  associative link  that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm. And then  when you've amputated the arm  this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom  OK  Now  how do you help these patients  How do you unlearn the learned paralysis  so you can relieve him of this excruciating  clenching spasm of the phantom arm  Well  we said  what if you now send the command to the phantom  but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command  right  Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain  the phantom cramp. How do you do that  Well  virtual reality. But that costs millions of dollars. So  I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars  but don't tell my funding agencies. OK  What you do is you create what I call a mirror box. You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle  and then you put the phantom    so my first patient  Derek  came in. He had his arm amputated    years ago. He had a brachial avulsion  so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed  lying in a sling for a year  and then the arm was amputated. He had a phantom arm  excruciatingly painful  and he couldn't move it. It was a paralyzed phantom arm. So he came there  and I gave him a mirror like that  in a box  which I call a mirror box  right  And the patient puts his phantom left arm  which is clenched and in spasm  on the left side of the mirror  and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror  and makes the same posture  the clenched posture  and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience  He looks at the phantom being resurrected  because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror  and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.  Now   I said   now  look  wiggle your phantom    your real fingers  or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror.  He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving  right  That's obvious  but the astonishing thing is  the patient then says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again  and the pain  the clenching spasm  is relieved.  And remember  my first patient who came in       thank you.  Applause  My first patient came in  and he looked in the mirror  and I said   Look at your reflection of your phantom.  And he started giggling  he says   I can see my phantom.  But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real. He knows it's a mirror reflection  but it's a vivid sensory experience. Now  I said   Move your normal hand and phantom.  He said   Oh  I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful.  I said   Move your normal hand.  And he says   Oh my God  my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this  And my pain is being relieved.  OK  And then I said   Close your eyes.  He closes his eyes.  And move your normal hand.   Oh  nothing. It's clenched again.   OK  open your eyes.   Oh my God  oh my God  it's moving again   So  he was like a kid in a candy store. So  I said  OK  this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input  but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb. It's a completely useless ability  if you think about it. But then I started realizing  maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology  like stroke  focal dystonias    there may be a learned component to this  which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. So  I said   Look  Derek     well  first of all  the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain    I said   Look  Derek  take it home and practice with it for a week or two. Maybe  after a period of practice  you can dispense with the mirror  unlearn the paralysis  and start moving your paralyzed arm  and then  relieve yourself of pain.  So he said OK  and he took it home. I said   Look  it's  after all  two dollars. Take it home.  So  he took it home  and after two weeks  he phones me  and he said   Doctor  you're not going to believe this.  I said   What   He said   It's gone.  I said   What's gone   I thought maybe the mirror box was gone. He said   No  no  no  you know this phantom I've had for the last    years  It's disappeared.  And I said    I got worried  I said  my God  I mean I've changed this guy's body image  what about human subjects  ethics and all of that  And I said   Derek  does this bother you   He said   No  last three days  I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain  no clenching  no phantom forearm pain  all those pains are gone away. But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder  and your box doesn't reach.   So  can you change the design and put it on my forehead  so I can  you know  do this and eliminate my phantom fingers   He thought I was some kind of magician. Now  why does this happen  It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict. It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back. On the other hand  there's no proprioception  muscle signals saying that there is no arm  right  And your motor command saying there is an arm  and  because of this conflict  the brain says  to hell with it  there is no phantom  there is no arm  right  It goes into a sort of denial    it gates the signals. And when the arm disappears  the bonus is  the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there  in space. So  that's the bonus. Now  this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki  so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain  and indeed  people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation. Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers  nothing you can do about it. But  it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis  and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors. This has also gone through clinical trials  helping lots and lots of patients. OK  let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk  which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia. This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century. He was a cousin of Charles Darwin. He pointed out that certain people in the population  who are otherwise completely normal  had the following peculiarity  every time they see a number  it's colored. Five is blue  seven is yellow  eight is chartreuse  nine is indigo  OK  Bear in mind  these people are completely normal in other respects. Or C sharp    sometimes  tones evoke color. C sharp is blue  F sharp is green  another tone might be yellow  right  Why does this happen  This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia  a mingling of the senses. In us  all the senses are distinct. These people muddle up their senses. Why does this happen  One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing. Synesthesia runs in families  so Galton said this is a hereditary basis  a genetic basis. Secondly  synesthesia is about    and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture  which is about creativity    synesthesia is eight times more common among artists  poets  novelists and other creative people than in the general population. Why would that be  I'm going to answer that question. It's never been answered before. OK  what is synesthesia  What causes it  Well  there are many theories. One theory is they're just crazy. Now  that's not really a scientific theory  so we can forget about it. Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads  right  Now  there may be some truth to this  because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego. OK. Now  the third theory is that    well  let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right  So  we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain  in the fusiform gyrus. So we said  there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain. So  every time you see a number  you see a corresponding color  and that's why you get synesthesia. Now remember    why does this happen  Why would there be crossed wires in some people  Remember I said it runs in families  That gives you the clue. And that is  there is an abnormal gene  a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring. In all of us  it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else. So  every brain region is wired to every other region  and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain. So  if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates  then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas. And if it's between number and color  you get number color synesthesia. If it's between tone and color  you get tone color synesthesia. So far  so good. Now  what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain  so everything is cross connected  Well  think about what artists  novelists and poets have in common  the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking  linking seemingly unrelated ideas  such as   It is the east  and Juliet is the Sun.  Well  you don't say  Juliet is the sun  does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire  I mean  schizophrenics do that  but it's a different story  right  Normal people say  she's warm like the sun  she's radiant like the sun  she's nurturing like the sun. Instantly  you've found the links. Now  if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain  then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia. And  hence  the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets  artists and novelists. OK  it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia. The last demonstration    can I take one minute  OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes  but you're in denial about it. Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet  A is A  B is B  C is C. Different shapes for different phonemes  right  Here  you've got Martian alphabet. One of them is Kiki  one of them is Buba. Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba  How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba  Raise your hands. Well  it's one or two mutants. How many of you think that's Buba  that's Kiki  Raise your hands. Ninety nine percent of you. Now  none of you is a Martian. How did you do that  It's because you're all doing a cross model synesthetic abstraction  meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection    ki ki  in your auditory cortex  the hair cells being excited    Kiki  mimics the visual inflection  sudden inflection of that jagged shape. Now  this is very important  because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive    it's just    it looks like a silly illusion  but these photons in your eye are doing this shape  and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern  but the brain is able to extract the common denominator. It's a primitive form of abstraction  and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain  because when that's damaged  these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki  but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor. If you ask this guy  what     all that glitters is not gold   what does that mean   The patient says   Well  if it's metallic and shiny  it doesn't mean it's gold. You have to measure its specific gravity  OK   So  they completely miss the metaphorical meaning. So  this area is about eight times the size in higher    especially in humans    as in lower primates. Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus  because it's the crossroads between hearing  vision and touch  and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on. And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction  metaphor and creativity. All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia  we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging  and by studying patients and asking the right questions. Thank you. Sorry about that. You know  there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains  far from these beautiful mountains  where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different  which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product. And why not  After all  happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few  but a fundamental human right for all. And what is happiness  Happiness is the freedom of choice. The freedom to chose where to live  what to do  what to buy  what to sell  from whom  to whom  when and how. Where does choice come from  And who gets to express it  and how do we express it  Well  one way to express choice is through the market. Well functioning markets provide choices  and ultimately  the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness. The great Indian economist  Amartya Sen  was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply  but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market. In       in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity  nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth  Ethiopia. Not because there was not enough food    because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country    but because in the north  people could not access or entitle themselves to that food. That was a turning point for my life. Most Africans today  by far  are farmers. And most of Africa's farmers are  by and large  small farmers in terms of land that they operate  and very  very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal. African agriculture today is among  or is  the most under capitalized in the world. Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated  compared to    percent in Asia. African farmers only use some    kilograms of fertilizer per hectare  compared to     in Asia. Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa. There are eight times more tractors in Latin America  and three times more tractors in Asia  than in Africa. The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice  and therefore without much freedom. His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty. He comes to the market when prices are lowest  with the meager fruits of his hard labor  just after the harvest  because he has no choice. She comes back to the market some months later  when prices are highest  in what we call the lean season    when food is scarce    because she has to feed her family and has no choice. The real question is  how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists  Another notable economist  Theodore Schultz  in      won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient  but poor. Meaning  in fact  that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else. Well  we don't need  now  any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money  just like everyone else. And one thing is clear  which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business. And that business is agriculture. Over two decades ago  the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized  that economies must be structurally adjusted. This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling    which they did rather inefficiently    and let the private market do its magic. Well  what happened over the last    years  Did Africa feed itself  Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors  I think we're all in this room  probably  because we know that  in fact  Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next    years  where the food import bill is now double what it was    years ago  where food production per capita has stagnated  and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased. So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations  The market reforms prompted by the West    and I've spent some    years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets  and have interviewed traders in    to    countries in this continent  hundreds of traders    trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform. And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water. Like its agriculture  Africa's markets are highly under capitalized and inefficient. We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market  and the risks of transacting in rural  agriculture markets  are extremely high. In fact  only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market. Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications  but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions  such as market information  grades and standards  and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers. Because of this  commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles  in narrow networks of people they know and trust. And because of that  as grain changes hands    and I've measured that it changes hands four  five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer    every time it changes hands    and I've seen this all over rural Africa    it also changes sacks. And I thought that was incredibly peculiar. And really realized that that was because    as traders would tell me over and over    that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality. And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals  and situations where there are deficits  for example. It also has very high cost implications. I have measured that    percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that  because of the absence of grades and standards and market information  sacks have to be constantly changed. And this leads to very high handling costs. For their part  small farmers  who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa  come to the market with virtually no information at all    blind    trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce  and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market  the nearest local market they know    where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk. Speaking of risk  we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world. In Africa  small farmers bear the brunt of this risk. In fact  in my view  there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear. And in my view  there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face. In Ethiopia  for example  the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as    percent annually. This kind of market risk is mind boggling  and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology  such as modern seeds and fertilizers  but also direct implications for food security. To give you an example  between      and       Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest. That in turn  because of the weak marketing system  led to an    percent collapse in maize prices in the country. This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields. And we calculated that some         tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early     . Not six months later  in July       Ethiopia announced a major food crisis  to the same proportions as          million people at risk of starvation. What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains  and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain  farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market  not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by    percent. This is a tragic example of arrested development  or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks. And this is not just specific to Ethiopia  but happens over and over  all over Africa. Well  I'm not here today to lament about the situation  or wring my hands. I am here to tell you that change is in the air. Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions  or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions. Africa has learned  or is learning somewhat slowly  that markets don't happen by themselves. In the     s  it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right. There was a very influential book about that  which was mainly about getting governments out of the market. We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives  but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market. When conditions are right  we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa  just like anywhere else. Nearly three years ago  I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth  Ethiopia  after nearly    years abroad. I did so for a simple reason. After having spent more than a decade understanding  studying  and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets  I decided it was time to do something about it. I currently lead  in Ethiopia  an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange  or ECX. Now  the commodity exchange itself  that concept  is not new to the world. In fact  in          grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves. That was  of course  the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade  which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world. The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange. In the American Midwest  farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market. But once it arrived  if no buyer was to be found  or if prices suddenly dropped  farmers would incur tremendous losses. And in fact  would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan  rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms. Well  the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market  and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting    issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done. From there  the greatest innovation of all came about in this market  which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain. That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances  and even across time    as far forward as    months into the future. This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture  and the rise of Chicago to a global market  agricultural market  superpower from where it was  a small regional town. Now  over the last century  we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries  and that the reference prices for cotton  coffee  cocoa    products produced mainly in the south    are actually a reference price  or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries. But that is actually changing. And we're seeing a shift    powered mainly because of information technology    a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets. And over the last decade  you see that the share of Western exchanges    and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world    has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade. Similarly  there's been explosive growth in India  for example  where rural farmers are using exchanges    growing here over the last three years by     percent a year. This is powered by low cost VSAT technology  aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market. China's Dalian Commodity Exchange  three years ago        overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world. Now  in Ethiopia  we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange. We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model  but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities  Ethiopia's small farmers. So  the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia. We're creating a system that serves all market actors  that creates integrity  trust  efficiency  transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described. In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia  we've done something rather unique  which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective  or what we call the ECX Edge. The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself. And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work. You've got one donor trying to develop market information  another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards  another ICT  and yet another on warehousing  or warehouse receipts. In our approach in Ethiopia  we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem  or environment  in which trade takes place. That means that the exchange will operate a trading system  which will initially start as an open outcry  because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading. But at the same time  we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done  which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas. So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center    what we call the remote access terminal centers    and actually  without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things  simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor. At the same time  what's very fundamental to this market is that    and again  an innovation that we've designed for our exchange    is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country  in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done. And in turn  we'll operate an in house clearing system  to assure that payment is done appropriately  in the right amount and at the right time  so that basically  we create trust and integrity in the system. Obviously  we work with exchange actors  and as we're developing the exchange market itself  we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework  the overarching legal framework for making this market work. So  in fact  our proclamation is going to parliament next month. What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country  using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers. What this does is transforms  fundamentally  the farmers' relationship to the market. Whereas before the farmer used to think local    meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market  eight to    kilometers away on average  and sell whatever they happened to have  without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was    now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market. And they start to think national  and even global. They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions  but also planting decisions  on the basis of information coming from the futures price market. And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium. So all of this will transform farmers. It will also transform the way traders do business. It will stop them from doing simple  back to back  limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from  surplus regions  to  deficit areas . Can Ethiopia do this  It seems very ambitious. But it will create new opportunities. We believe that this initiative requires great political will  and we'll have to align the financial sector  as well as the ICT sector  and really even the underlying legal framework. We believe that the winds of change are here  and that we can do it. ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium  which starts in about eight months. The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today. We believe that the stakes are high  but that the returns will be even greater. ECX  moreover  can become a trading platform for a pan African market in agricultural commodities. Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value. And we feel that over the next five years  if Ethiopia can capture even    percent  just    percent  of the domestic market  and add just    percent value to that market  the value of the market doubles. Ethiopia's agricultural market is    percent higher than South Africa's grain production  and  in fact  Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa. So the potential is there. The will is there. The commitment is there. So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices  to grow our agriculture  and to change Africa. So  we are in the business of finding our happiness. Thank you very much. I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time  which is to choose a light hearted theme. Last time  I talked about death and dying. This time  I'm going to talk about mental illness. But it has to be technological  so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.  Laughter  You know  ever since man had any notion that some of his other people  his colleagues  could be different  could be strange  could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia  he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body. So  the way of treating these diseases in early times was to  in some way or other  exorcise those evil spirits  and this is still going on  as you know. But it wasn't enough to use the priests. When medicine became somewhat scientific  in about     BC  with Hippocrates and those boys  they tried to look for herbs  plants that would literally shake the bad spirits out. So  they found certain plants that could cause convulsions. And the herbals  the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages  the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out. Finally  in about the sixteenth century  a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim  called Paracelsus  a name probably familiar to some people here    found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion. Can you imagine going to your closet  pulling out a mothball  and chewing on it if you're feeling depressed  It's better than Prozac  but I wouldn't recommend it. So what we see in the seventeenth  eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick. Well  along comes Benjamin Franklin  and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite. And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions. And then  we fast forward to about       when three Italian psychiatrists  who were largely treating depression  began to notice among their patients  who were also epileptics  that if they had an epileptic    a series of epileptic fits  a lot of them in a row    the depression would very frequently lift. Not only would it lift  but it might never return. So they got very interested in producing convulsions  measured types of convulsions. And they thought   Well  we've got electricity  we'll plug somebody into the wall. That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot.  So  they tried it on a few pigs  and none of the pigs were killed. So  they went to the police and they said   We know that at the Rome railroad station  there are all these lost souls wandering around  muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us   Someone who is  as the Italians say   cagoots.  So they found this  cagoots  guy  a    year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic  who was known  had been known for months  to be literally defecating on himself  talking nothing that made any sense  and they brought him into the hospital. So these three psychiatrists  after about two or three weeks of observation  laid him down on a table  connected his temples to a very small source of current. They thought   Well  we'll try    volts  two tenths of a second. That's not going to do anything terrible to him.  So they did that. Well  I have the following from a firsthand observer  who told me this about    years ago  when I was thinking about these things for some research project of mine. He said   This fellow     remember  he wasn't even put to sleep     after this major grand mal convulsion  sat right up  looked at these three fellas and said  'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do '   If I could only say that in Italian. Well  they were happy as could be  because he hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation. So they plugged him in again  and this time they used     volts for half a second. And to their amazement  after it was over  he began speaking like he was perfectly well. He relapsed a little bit  they gave him a series of treatments  and he was essentially cured. But of course  having schizophrenia  within a few months  it returned. But they wrote a paper about this  and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed. It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics  but it was pretty clear in the '  s and by the middle of the '  s that electroconvulsive therapy was very  very effective in the treatment of depression. And of course  in those days  there were no antidepressant drugs  and it became very  very popular. They would anesthetize people  convulse them  but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles. So people would have a real grand mal seizure. Bones were broken. Especially in old  fragile people  you couldn't use it. And then in the     s  late     s  the so called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists  and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion  an electroencephalographic convulsion    you could see it on the brain waves    without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes. So again  it was very  very popular and very  very useful. Well  you know  in the middle '  s  the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first. In the late '  s  early '  s  there were others  and they were very effective. And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness. And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive  electroshock therapy disappeared  but has had a renaissance in the last    years. And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about    percent of the people  severe depressives  do not respond  regardless of what is done for them. Now  why am I telling you this story at this meeting  I'm telling you this story  because actually ever since Richard called me and asked me to talk about    as he asked all of his speakers    to talk about something that would be new to this audience  that we had never talked about  never written about  I've been planning this moment. This reason really is that I am a man who  almost    years ago  had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy. And let me tell you this story. I was  in the     s  in a marriage. To use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year. It was dreadful. There are  I'm sure  enough divorced people in this room to know about the hostility  the anger  who knows what. Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood  a very difficult adolescence    it had to do with not quite poverty but close. It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English  no one could read or write English. It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things. I was a little prone to depression. So  as things got worse  as we really began to hate each other  I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years  trying to save this marriage  which was inevitably not to be saved. Finally  I would schedule    all my major surgical cases  I was scheduling them for     one o'clock in the afternoon  because I couldn't get out of bed before about    o'clock. And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like. I couldn't even pull the covers off myself. Well  you're in a university medical center  where everybody knows everybody  and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues  so my referrals began to decrease. As my referrals began to decrease  I clearly became increasingly depressed until I thought  my God  I can't work anymore. And  in fact  it didn't make any difference because I didn't have any patients anymore. So  with the advice of my physician  I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital. And my colleagues  who had known me since medical school in that place  said   Don't worry  chap. Six weeks  you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great.  Well  you know what bovine stercus is  That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus. I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that. So I was one of their failures. But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time I got out of that unit  I was not functional at all. I could hardly see five feet in front of myself. I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over. I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful. And it was clear    not to me  because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore    that I would need long term hospitalization in that awful place called a mental hospital. So I was admitted  in       in the spring of       to the Institute of Living  which used to be called the Hartford Retreat. It was founded in the eighteenth century  the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of Connecticut  other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time. And they tried everything they had. They tried the usual psychotherapy. They tried every medication available in those days. And they did have Tofranil and other things    Mellaril  who knows what. Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things. And finally  because I was well known in Connecticut  they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff. All the senior staff got together  and I later found out what happened. They put all their heads together and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world  who by that time had become so overwhelmed  not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy  but with obsessional thinking  obsessional thinking about coincidences. And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them  just got me dreadfully upset    all kinds of ritualistic observances  just awful  awful stuff. Remember when you were a kid  and you had to step on every line  Well  I was a grown man who had all of these rituals  and it got so there was a throbbing  there was a ferocious fear in my head. You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch  The Scream. Every moment was a scream. It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy  there was no treatment. But there was one treatment  which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early     s  and you can imagine what it was. It was pre frontal lobotomy. So they decided    I didn't know this  again  I found this out later    that the only thing that could be done was for this    year old man to have a pre frontal lobotomy. Well  as in all hospitals  there was a resident assigned to my case. He was    years old  and he would meet with me two or three times a week. And of course  I had been there  what  three or four months at the time. And he asked to meet with the senior staff  and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place. They thought he had a really extraordinary future. And he dug in his heels and said   No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again. You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth. I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression  and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it. And you know  of course  what'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy. Any of the results along the spectrum  from pretty bad to terrible  terrible  terrible is going to happen. If he does the best he can  he will have no further obsessions  probably no depression  but his affect will be dulled  he will never go back to surgery  he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children  his life will be changed. If he has the usual result  he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' And you know about that  just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life.  Well  he said   Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy   And you know why they agreed  They agreed to humor him. They just thought   Well  we'll give a course of   . And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference.  So they gave the course of     and the first    the usual course  incidentally  was six to eight and still is six to eight. Plugged me into the wires  put me to sleep  gave me the muscle relaxant. Six didn't work. Seven didn't work. Eight didn't work. At nine  I noticed    and it's wonderful that I could notice anything    I noticed a change. And at     I noticed a real change. And he went back to them  and they agreed to do another   . Again  not a single one of them    I think there are about seven or eight of them    thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change. But  lo and behold  by     by     there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt. By    and     I was sleeping through the night. And by     I had the sense  I really had the sense that I could overcome this  that I was now strong enough that by an act of will  I could blow the obsessional thinking away. I could blow the depression away. And I've never forgotten    I never will forget    standing in the kitchen of the unit  it was a Sunday morning in January of       standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking   I've got the strength now to do this.  It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and I could think clearly. But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself when I begin thinking obsessionally  obsessively. Well  the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room will remember  Ruddigore   and they will remember Mad Margaret  and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd. And she used to go nuts  every five minutes or so in the play  and he said to her   We must have a word to bring you back to reality  and the word  my dear  will be 'Basingstoke.'  So every time she got a little nuts  he would say   Basingstoke   And she would say   Basingstoke  it is.  And she would be fine for a little while. Well  you know  I'm from the Bronx. I can't say  Basingstoke.  But I had something better. And it was very simple. It was   Ah  fuck it   at least for me. And it worked    my God  it worked. Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally    again  once more  after    shock treatments    I would say   Ah  fuck it.  And things got better and better  and within three or four months  I was discharged from that hospital  and I joined a group of surgeons where I could work with other people in the community  not in New Haven  but fairly close by. I stayed there for three years. At the end of three years  I went back to New Haven  had remarried by that time. I brought my wife with me  actually  to make sure I could get through this. My children came back to live with us. We had two more children after that. Resuscitated the career  even better than it had been before. Went right back into the university and began to write books. Well  you know  it's been a wonderful life. It's been  as I said  close to    years. I stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full time writer  as many people know. But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy. Every once in a while  I have to say   Ah  fuck it.  Every once in a while  I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional. So  I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked. Why have I chosen  after never  ever talking about this  to talk about it now  Well  those of you who know some of these books know that one is about death and dying  one is about the human body and the human spirit  one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds  and they have always to do with my own personal experiences. One might think reading these books    and I've gotten thousands of letters about them by people who do think this    that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books  my early life's history  I am someone who has overcome adversity. That I am someone who has drunk  drank  drunk of the bitter dregs of near disaster in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened. I really have it figured out  so that I can advise people about death and dying  so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit. And I've always felt guilty about that. I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor because my readers don't know what I have just told you. It's known by some people in New Haven  obviously  but it is not generally known. So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today is to    frankly  selfishly    unburden myself and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books. But more importantly  I think  is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under     and there are many  of course  who are well over   . For people under     and it looks to me like almost all of you    I would say all of you    are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent and exciting career  anything can happen to you. Things change. Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you. You can be thrown off the track. I hope it happens to none of you  but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you. To those to whom it doesn't happen  there will be adversities. If I  with the bleakness of spirit  with no spirit  that I had in the     s and no possibility of recovery  as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought  if I can find my way back from this  believe me  anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives. And for those who are older  who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this  but who have lived through difficult times  perhaps where they lost everything  as I did  and started out all over again  some of these things will seem very familiar. There is recovery. There is redemption. And there is resurrection. There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied  and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery  but it actually happens. And it happens a lot. Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme  outside of specifically religious ones  is the one about the phoenix  the ancient story of the phoenix  who  every     years  resurrects itself from its own ashes to go on to live a life that is even more beautiful than it was before. Richard  thanks very much. So  I guess it is a result of globalization that you can find Coca Cola tins on top of Everest and a Buddhist monk in Monterey. And so I just came  two days ago  from the Himalayas to your kind invitation. So I would like to invite you  also  for a while  to the Himalayas themselves. And to show the place where meditators  like me  who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute  and found their way to the mountains. So these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there. There's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet    wonderful setting. This is from Marlboro country. This is a turquoise lake. A meditator. This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet  on August  . And the night before  we camped  and my Tibetan friends said   We are going to sleep outside.  And I said   Why  We have enough space in the tent.  They said   Yes  but it's summertime.  So now  we are going to speak of happiness. As a Frenchman  I must say that there are a lot of French intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting. I just wrote an essay on happiness  and there was a controversy. And someone wrote an article saying   Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness.   We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion. We like the ups and downs of life. We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while.  This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas. It's about two meters by three  and you are all welcome any time. Now  let's come to happiness or well being. And first of all  you know  despite what the French intellectuals say  it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking   May I suffer the whole day   Which means that somehow  consciously or not  directly or indirectly  in the short or the long term  whatever we do  whatever we hope  whatever we dream    somehow  is related to a deep  profound desire for well being or happiness. As Pascal said  even the one who hangs himself  somehow  is looking for cessation of suffering. He finds no other way. But then  if you look in the literature  East and West  you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness. Some people say  I only believed in remembering the past  imagining the future  never the present. Some people say happiness is right now  it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment. And that led Henri Bergson  the French philosopher  to say   All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that each of them could define their own terms.  Well  that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life. But now  if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life  then we better know what it is  have some clearer idea. And probably  the fact that we don't know that is why  so often  although we seek happiness  it seems we turn our back to it. Although we want to avoid suffering  it seems we are running somewhat towards it. And that can also come from some kind of confusions. One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure. But if you look at the characteristics of those two  pleasure is contingent upon time  upon its object  upon the place. It is something that    changes of nature. Beautiful chocolate cake  first serving is delicious  second one not so much  then we feel disgust. That's the nature of things. We get tired. I used to be a fan of Bach. I used to play it on the guitar  you know. I can hear it two  three  five times. If I had to hear it    hours  non stop  it might be very tiring. If you are feeling very cold  you come near a fire  it's so wonderful. After some moments  you just go a little back  and then it starts burning. It sort of uses itself as you experience it. And also  again  it can    also  it's something that you    it is not something that is radiating outside. Like  you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot. Now  what  then  will be happiness  And happiness  of course  is such a vague word  so let's say well being. And so  I think the best definition  according to the Buddhist view  is that well being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation. It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment. A state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states  and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way. For you  that might be surprising. Can we have this kind of well being while being sad  In a way  why not  Because we are speaking of a different level. Look at the waves coming near the shore. When you are at the bottom of the wave  you hit the bottom. You hit the solid rock. When you are surfing on the top  you are all elated. So you go from elation to depression    there's no depth. Now  if you look at the high sea  there might be beautiful  calm ocean  like a mirror. There might be storms  but the depth of the ocean is still there  unchanged. So now  how is that  It can only be a state of being  not just a fleeting emotion  sensation. Even joy    that can be the spring of happiness. But there's also wicked joy  you can rejoice in someone's suffering. So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness  Very often  we look outside. We think that if we could gather this and that  all the conditions  something that we say   Everything to be happy    to have everything to be happy.  That very sentence already reveals the doom  destruction of happiness. To have everything. If we miss something  it collapses. And also  when things go wrong  we try to fix the outside so much  but our control of the outer world is limited  temporary  and often  illusory. So now  look at inner conditions. Aren't they stronger  Isn't it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering  And isn't that stronger  We know  by experience  that we can be what we call  a little paradise   and yet  be completely unhappy within. The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal  and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere. So one evening  he said   Look  you are doing all these things  but isn't it nice  also  to build something within   And he said    Without  that    even if you get a high tech flat on the    th floor of a super modern and comfortable building  if you are deeply unhappy within  all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump.  So now  at the opposite  we know a lot of people who  in very difficult circumstances  manage to keep serenity  inner strength  inner freedom  confidence. So now  if the inner conditions are stronger    of course  the outer conditions do influence  and it's wonderful to live longer  healthier  to have access to information  education  to be able to travel  to have freedom. It's highly desirable. However  this is not enough. Those are just auxiliary  help conditions. The experience that translates everything is within the mind. So then  when we ask oneself how to nurture the condition for happiness  the inner conditions  and which are those which will undermine happiness. So then  this just needs to have some experience. We have to know from ourselves  there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing  to this well being  what the Greeks called eudaimonia  flourishing. There are some which are adverse to this well being. And so  if we look from our own experience  anger  hatred  jealousy  arrogance  obsessive desire  strong grasping  they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it. And also  they are detrimental to others' happiness. So we may consider that the more those are invading our mind  and  like a chain reaction  the more we feel miserable  we feel tormented. At the opposite  everyone knows deep within that an act of selfless generosity  if from the distance  without anyone knowing anything about it  we could save a child's life  make someone happy. We don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude. Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature. And we would like to be like that all the time. So is that possible  to change our way of being  to transform one's mind  Aren't those negative emotions  or destructive emotions  inherent to the nature of mind  Is change possible in our emotions  in our traits  in our moods  For that we have to ask  what is the nature of mind  And if we look from the experiential point of view  there is a primary quality of consciousness that's just the mere fact to be cognitive  to be aware. Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it. You can have ugly faces  beautiful faces in the mirror. The mirror allows that  but the mirror is not tainted  is not modified  is not altered by those images. Likewise  behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness  pure awareness. This is the nature. It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then  if it was always there    like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth    then it would be found all the time  somewhere. We know we're not always angry  always jealous  always generous. So  because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone  there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting. That is the ground for mind training. Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time. You could go from love to hate. But you cannot  at the same time  toward the same object  the same person  want to harm and want to do good. You cannot  in the same gesture  shake hand and give a blow. So  there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well being. So that's the way to proceed. Rejoicing compared to jealousy. A kind of sense of inner freedom as opposite to intense grasping and obsession. Benevolence  loving kindness against hatred. But  of course  each emotion then would need a particular antidote. Another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions  and that's by looking at the very nature. Usually  when we feel annoyed  hatred or upset with someone  or obsessed with something  the mind goes again and again to that object. Each time it goes to the object  it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance. So then  it's a self perpetuating process. So what we need to look for now is  instead of looking outward  we look inward. Look at anger itself. It looks very menacing  like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm. We think we could sit on the cloud  but if you go there  it's just mist. Likewise  if you look at the thought of anger  it will vanish like frost under the morning sun. If you do this again and again  the propensity  the tendencies for anger to arise again will be less and less each time you dissolve it. And  at the end  although it may rise  it will just cross the mind  like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track. So this is the principal of mind training. Now  it takes time  because it took time for all those faults in our mind  the tendencies  to build up  so it will take time to unfold them as well. But that's the only way to go. Mind transformation    that is the very meaning of meditation. It means familiarization with a new way of being  new way of perceiving things  which is more in adequation with reality  with interdependence  with the stream and continuous transformation  which our being and our consciousness is. So  the interface with cognitive science  since we need to come to that  it was  I suppose  the subject of    we have to deal in such a short time    with brain plasticity. The brain was thought to be more or less fixed. All the nominal connections  in numbers and quantities  were thought  until the last    years  to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age. Now  recently  it has been found that it can change a lot. A violinist  as we heard  who has done        hours of violin practice  some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot  increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections. So can we do that with human qualities  With loving kindness  with patience  with openness  So that's what those great meditators have been doing. Some of them who came to the labs  like in Madison  Wisconsin  or in Berkeley  did    to        hours of meditation. They do  like  three years' retreat  where they do meditate    hours a day. And then  the rest of their life  they will do three or four hours a day. They are real Olympic champions of mind training. This is the place where the meditators    you can see it's kind of inspiring. Now  here with     electrodes. So what did they find  Of course  same thing. The scientific embargo    if it's ever submitted to  Nature   hopefully  it will be accepted. It deals with the state of compassion  unconditional compassion. We asked meditators  who have been doing that for years and years  to put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness  total availability to sentient being. Of course  during the training  we do that with objects. We think of people suffering  of people we love  but at some point  it can be a state which is all pervading. Here is the preliminary result  which I can show because it's already been shown. The bell curve shows     controls  and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe. In very short  people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed  withdrawn. They don't describe a lot of positive affect. It's the opposite on the left side  more tendency to altruism  to happiness  to express  and curiosity and so forth. So there's a basic line for people. And also  it can be changed. If you see a comic movie  you go off to the left side. If you are happy about something  you'll go more to the left side. If you have a bout of depression  you'll go to the right side. Here  the   .  is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion. It's something that is totally out of the bell curve. So  I've no time to go into all the different scientific results. Hopefully  they will come. But they found that    this is after three and a half hours in an fMRI  it's like coming out of a space ship. Also  it has been shown in other labs    for instance  Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley    that some meditators are able  also  to control their emotional response more than it could be thought. Like the startle experiments  for example. If you sit a guy on a chair with all this apparatus measuring your physiology  and there's kind of a bomb that goes off  it's such an instinctive response that  in    years  they never saw anyone who would not jump. Some meditators  without trying to stop it  but simply by being completely open  thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star  they are able not to move at all. So the whole point of that is not  sort of  to make  like  a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump  or whatever. It's more to say that mind training matters. That this is not just a luxury. This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul. This is something that's going to determine the quality of every instant of our lives. We are ready to spend    years achieving education. We love to do jogging  fitness. We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful. Yet  we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most    the way our mind functions    which  again  is the ultimate thing that determines the quality of our experience. Now  compassion is supposed to be put in action. That's what we try to do in different places. Just this one example is worth a lot of work. This lady with bone TB  left alone in a tent  was going to die with her only daughter. One year later  how she is. Different schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet. And just  I leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than I could ever say. And jumping monks of Tibet. Flying monks. Thank you very much. I want to talk to you a little bit about user generated content. I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument that's going to tell you a little bit about how we open user generated content up for business. So  here's the first story.     . This man  John Philip Sousa  traveled to this place  the United States Capitol  to talk about this technology  what he called the  quote   talking machines.  Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines. This is what he had to say.  These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy  in front of every house in the summer evenings  you would find young people together singing the songs of the day  or the old songs. Today  you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left   Sousa said.  The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution as was the tail of man when he came from the ape.  Now  this is the picture I want you to focus on. This is a picture of culture. We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read write culture. It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re creation of their culture. In that sense  it's read write. Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these  quote   infernal machines.  They would take it away. And in its place  we'd have the opposite of read write culture  what we could call read only culture. Culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator. A culture which is top down  owned  where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost. Now  as you look back at the twentieth century  at least in what we think of as the  quote   developed world     hard not to conclude that Sousa was right. Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized  never before as concentrated. Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced  and displaced because of these  quote   infernal machines.  The twentieth century was that century where  at least for those places we know the best  culture moved from this read write to read only existence. So  second. Land is a kind of property    it is property. It's protected by law. As Lord Blackstone described it  land is protected by trespass law  for most of the history of trespass law  by presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward. Now  that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land  until this technology came along  and people began to wonder  were these instruments trespassers as they flew over land without clearing the rights of the farms below as they traveled across the country  Well  in       Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. Two farmers  Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby  who raised chickens  had a significant complaint because of these technologies. The complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land. And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing. Since time immemorial  the law had said  you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner  so this flight must stop. Well  the Supreme Court considered this     years tradition and said  in an opinion written by Justice Douglas  that the Causbys must lose. The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world  otherwise every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense  a rare idea in the law  but here it was. Common sense    Revolts at the idea. Common sense. Finally. Before the Internet  the last great terror to rain down on the content industry was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting  a new way to spread content  and therefore a new battle over the control of the businesses that would spread content. Now  at that time  the entity  the legal cartel  that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ASCAP. They had an exclusive license on the most popular content  and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge. So  between      and       they raised rates by some     percent  until the broadcasters finally got together and said  okay  enough of this. And in       a lawyer  Sydney Kaye  started something called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI. And BMI was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire  including African American music for the first time in the repertoire. But most important was that BMI took public domain works and made arrangements of them  which they gave away for free to their subscribers. So that in       when ASCAP threatened to double their rates  the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI. Now  ASCAP said they didn't care. The people will revolt  they predicted  because the very best music was no longer available  because they had shifted to the second best public domain provided by BMI. Well  they didn't revolt  and in       ASCAP cracked. And the important point to recognize is that even though these broadcasters were broadcasting something you would call second best  that competition was enough to break  at that time  this legal cartel over access to music. Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument. In my view  the most significant thing to recognize about what this Internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read write culture that Sousa romanticized. Digital technology is the opportunity for the revival of these vocal chords that he spoke so passionately to Congress about. User generated content  spreading in businesses in extraordinarily valuable ways like these  celebrating amateur culture. By which I don't mean amateurish culture  I mean culture where people produce for the love of what they're doing and not for the money. I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time. For when you think of what Sousa romanticized in the young people together  singing the songs of the day  of the old songs  you should recognize what your kids are doing right now. Taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different. It's how they understand access to this culture. So  let's have some very few examples to get a sense of what I'm talking about here. Here's something called Anime Music Video  first example  taking anime captured from television re edited to music tracks. This one you should be    confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry. And this is the best. My love ... There's only you in my life ... The only thing that's bright ... My first love ... You're every breath that I take ... You're every step I make ... And I .... I want to share all my love with you ... No one else will do ... And your eyes ... They tell me how much you care ... So  this is remix  right  And it's important to emphasize that what this is not is not what we call  quote   piracy.  I'm not talking about nor justifying people taking other people's content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner. I'm talking about people taking and recreating using other people's content  using digital technologies to say things differently. Now  the importance of this is not the technique that you've seen here. Because  of course  every technique that you've seen here is something that television and film producers have been able to do for the last    years. The importance is that that technique has been democratized. It is now anybody with access to a        computer who can take sounds and images from the culture around us and use it to say things differently. These tools of creativity have become tools of speech. It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak. It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves. Now  in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies  the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense. Instead  the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies  as they interact  have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal. Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies  then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy. Every single use therefore requires permission  without permission  you are a trespasser. You're a trespasser with about as much sense as these people were trespassers. Common sense here  though  has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity. Instead  what we've seen is something much worse than a revolt. There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides in this debate  in response to this conflict between the law and the use of these technologies. One side builds new technologies  such as one recently announced that will enable them to automatically take down from sites like YouTube any content that has any copyrighted content in it  whether or not there's a judgment of fair use that might be applied to the use of that content. And on the other side  among our kids  there's a growing copyright abolitionism  a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do  rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible. The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other  a fact we should have learned many  many times over  and both extremes in this debate are just wrong. Now  the balance that I try to fight for  I  as any good liberal  try to fight for first by looking to the government. Total mistake  right  Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense. It failed partly because the courts are too passive  partly because the legislatures are corrupted  by which I don't mean that there's bribery operating to stop real change  but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it's too late to fix it. So  we need something different  we need a different kind of solution. And the solution here  in my view  is a private solution  a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again  and to realize the economic potential of that  and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant. Because  as BMI demonstrated  competition here can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now. We don't have a public domain to draw upon now  so instead what we need is two types of changes. First  that artists and creators embrace the idea  choose that their work be made available more freely. So  for example  they can say their work is available freely for non commercial  this amateur type of use  but not freely for any commercial use. And second  we need the businesses that are building out this read write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly  to enable it  so that this ecology of free content  or freer content  can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously  so that more free can compete with less free  and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other. Now  I would talk about one particular such plan that I know something about  but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling  so I'm not going to talk about this at all. I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us. That artist choice is the key for new technology having an opportunity to be open for business  and we need to build artist choice here if these new technologies are to have that opportunity. But let me end with something I think much more important    much more important than business. It's the point about how this connects to our kids. We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us  right  We made mixed tapes  they remix music. We watched TV  they make TV. It is technology that has made them different  and as we see what this technology can do  we need to recognize you can't kill the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it. We can't stop our kids from using it. We can only drive it underground. We can't make our kids passive again. We can only make them  quote   pirates.  And is that good  We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions  where in many areas of our life  we live life constantly against the law. Ordinary people live life against the law  and that's what I    we are doing to our kids. They live life knowing they live it against the law. That realization is extraordinarily corrosive  extraordinarily corrupting. And in a democracy  we ought to be able to do better. Do better  at least for them  if not for opening for business. Thank you very much. There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power  that spells exist  and that if we could only pronounce the right words  then    whooosh    you know  an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits  right  So this is a very attractive idea because we're very lazy  like the sorcerer's apprentice  or the world's greatest computer programmer. And so this idea has a lot of traction with us. We love the idea that words  when pronounced    they're just little more than pure information  but they evoke some physical action in the real world that helps us do work. And so  of course  with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture. So how many of you know what I'm talking about  Raise your right hand. OK. How many of you don't know what I'm talking about  Raise your left hand. So that's great. So that was too easy. You guys have very insecure computers  OK  So now  the thing is that this is a different kind of spell. This is a computer program made of zeros and ones. It can be pronounced on a computer. It does something like this. The important thing is we can write it in a high level language. A computer magician can write this thing. It can be compiled into this    into zeros and ones    and pronounced by a computer. And that's what makes computers powerful  these high level languages that can be compiled. And so  I'm here to tell you  you don't need a computer to actually have a spell. In fact  what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information    you encode a spell or program as molecules    then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program. That's what happens in proteins. When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms  these little letters are sticky for each other. It collapses into a three dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA. And the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence  you change the three dimensional folding. You get now a DNA stapler instead. These are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write  but the problem is  we don't know the machine language of proteins. We don't have a compiler for proteins. So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA. We use DNA because it's cheaper. It's easier to handle. It's something that we understand really well. We understand it so well  in fact  that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers. So then  we think we can do that. And my first question doing this    or one of my questions doing this    was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA  And I decided to use a type of DNA origami  where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want. So here's a shape. I actually spent about a year in my home  in my underwear  coding  like Linus  Torvalds   in that picture before. And this program takes a shape  spits out     DNA sequences. These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make. So you send an e mail with these sequences in it to a company  and what it does    the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer. It's a machine about the size of a photocopier. And what happens is  they take your e mail and every letter in your e mail  they replace with    atom cluster    one for each letter  A  T  C  and G in DNA. They string them up in the right sequence  and then they send them back to you via FedEx. So you get     of these in the mail in little tubes. I mix them together  add a little bit of salt water  and then add this long strand I was telling you about  that I've stolen from a virus. And then what happens is  you heat this whole thing up to about boiling. You cool it down to room temperature  and as you do  what happens is those short strands  they do the following thing  each one of them binds that long strand in one place  and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place  and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together. And so the net effect of all     of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for. It'll approximate that shape. We do this for real in the test tube. In each little drop of water you get    billion of these guys. You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface. And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell  you just change the sequence of the staples. You can make a molecule that looks like this  and  you know  he likes to hang out with his buddies  right. And a lot of them are actually pretty good. If you change the spell again  you change the sequence again. You get really nice     nanometer triangles. If you do it again  you can get arbitrary patterns. So on a rectangle you can paint patterns of North and South America  or the words   DNA.  So that's DNA origami. That's one way. There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA. What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self assembly so that we can build anything  right  We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world. We want to learn how to build biological artifacts  like people and whales and trees. And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity  if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good  then that will truly be magic. Thank you very much. You've all seen lots of articles on climate change  and here's yet another New York Times article  just like every other darn one you've seen. It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen. It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen. What's unusual about this one  maybe  is that it's from     . And the reason I'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent. That people have just sort of figured out about it  and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something  we may be on the road to a solution. The fact is    uh uh. We've known about this problem for    years  depending on how you count it. We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so. And we've accomplished close to zip. This is the growth rate of CO  in the atmosphere. You've seen this in various forms  but maybe you haven't seen this one. What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating. And that it's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back. So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible  that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line. But in fact  they're growing faster. Here's some data from actually just    days ago  which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice  and it's the lowest by far. And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models. So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning jet fuel  and politicians signing treaties    in fact  you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative  because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel.  Laughter  No  no  In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on this very high inertial thing    our big economy    we've really hardly started. Really  we're doing this  basically. Really  not very much. I don't want to depress you too much. The problem is absolutely soluble  and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap. Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military  not the cost of medical care. Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP. No  this is really important to have this sense of scale. So the problem is soluble  and the way we should go about solving it is  say  dealing with electricity production  which causes something like    or so percent and rising of CO  emissions. And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation  and wind power  nuclear power and coal to CO  capture  which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment  and work. All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place. Instead  we spend our time talking. But nevertheless  that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight. What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing. And it's this stuff in the middle here  which is what you do if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough. And you need to deal    somehow break the link between human actions that change climate  and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important because  of course  while we can adapt to climate change    and it's important to be honest here  there will be some benefits to climate change. Oh  yes  I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it. But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers    not all losers. But  of course  the natural world  polar bears. I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic. They will completely lose. And there's no adaption. So this problem is absolutely soluble. This geo engineering idea  in it's simplest form  is basically the following. You could put signed particles  say sulfuric acid particles    sulfates    into the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere  where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet. And I know for certain that that will work. Not that there aren't side effects  but I know for certain it will work. And the reason is  it's been done. And it was done not by us  not by me  but by nature. Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '  s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb like cloud. The result of that was pretty dramatic. After that  and some previous volcanoes we have  you see a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere. So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere  and it heats up after these volcanoes. But you'll notice that in the upper bar  which is the lower atmosphere and the surface  it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit. There's no big mystery about it. There's lots of mystery in the details  and there's some bad side effects  like it partially destroys the ozone layer    and I'll get to that in a minute. But it clearly cools down. And one other thing  it's fast. It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do  like slowing emissions  are intrinsically slow  because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions. And not only that  when you cut emissions  you don't cut concentrations  because concentrations  the amount of CO  in the air  is the sum of emissions over time. So you can't step on the brakes very quickly. But if you do this  it's quick. And there are times you might like to do something quick. Another thing you might wonder about is  does it work  Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO   and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally  And the answer seems to be yes. So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before. That's what the world looks like  under one particular climate model's view  with twice the amount of CO  in the air. The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO  and  .  percent less sunlight  and you're back to the original climate. And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came  because Ken    at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid '  s    Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said   Geo engineering won't work.  And to the person who was promoting it said   The atmosphere's much more complicated.  Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation. Ken went and ran his models  and found that it did. This topic is also old. That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old        . That report  in fact  which had all the modern climate science    the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering. It didn't even talk about cutting emissions  which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem. I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions. We should  but it made exactly this point. So  in a sense  there's not much new. The one new thing is this essay. So I should say  I guess  that since the time of that original President Johnson report  and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy                        people always talked about this idea. Not as something that was foolproof  but as an idea to think about. But when climate became  politically  a hot topic    if I may make the pun    in the last    years  this became so un PC  we couldn't talk about it. It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it. But in the last year  Paul Crutzen published this essay saying roughly what's all been said before  that maybe  given our very slow rate of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts  we should think about things like this. He said roughly what's been said before. The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry. And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this  even though there will be some ozone impacts. And in fact  he had some ideas to make them go away. There was all sorts of press coverage  all over the world  going right down to  Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth   from the Economist. And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off  but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night. And I thought about this child's toy    hence  the title of my talk    and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round in the child's radiometer  to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there. One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly. The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer  and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer. And it turns out  I woke up the next morning  and I started to calculate this. It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped. But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere. So it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere  about     kilometers up  that already have this effect. I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works. There are a lot of fun complexities that I'd love to spend the whole evening on  but I won't. But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated. So the side facing the sun is warmer  the side away  cooler. Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm. And so you see a net force away from the sun. That's called the photophoretic force. There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators have thought about how to exploit. And of course  we may be wrong    this hasn't all been peer reviewed  we're in the middle of thinking about it    but so far  it seems good. But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes    much longer than before    because they're levitated. We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere  in principle solving the ozone problem. I'm sure there will be other problems that arise. Finally  we could make the particles migrate to over the poles  so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles. Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet  where we live  and do the maximum job of what we might need to do  which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency  if you like. This is a new idea that's crept up that may be  essentially  a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in. Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right  I think it's almost certain we will eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in. That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this  it's amazing how we can affect the planet. The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage. This improved science and engineering will  whether we like it or not  give us more and more leverage to affect the planet  to control the planet  to give us weather and climate control    not because we plan it  not because we want it  just because science delivers it to us bit by bit  with better knowledge of the way the system works and better engineering tools to effect it. Now  suppose that space aliens arrived. Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here  or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot    but suppose they arrive and they give you a box. And the box has two knobs. One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature. Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO  concentrations. You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box. Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs. We have no global governance. And different people will have different places they want it set. Now  I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely. But we're building that box. The scientists and engineers of the world are building it piece by piece  in their labs. Even when they're doing it for other reasons. Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment. They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet. They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do. And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it    I do not    but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously. Because sooner or later  we'll be confronted with decisions about this  and it's better if we think hard about it  even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning of my thinking about how to think about it. But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this. We need a broader debate. A debate that involves musicians  scientists  philosophers  writers  who get engaged with this question about climate engineering and think seriously about what its implications are. So here's one way to think about it  which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper. I guess the thing I haven't said about this is  it is absurdly cheap. It's conceivable that  say  using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with  you could create an ice age at a cost of .    percent of GDP. It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage. It's not a good idea  but it's just important.  Laughter  I'll tell you how big the lever is  the lever is that big. And that calculation isn't much in dispute. You might argue about the sanity of it  but the leverage is real.  Laughter  So because of this  we could deal with the problem simply by stopping reducing emissions  and just as the concentrations go up  we can increase the amount of geo engineering. I don't think anybody takes that seriously. Because under this scenario  we walk further and further away from the current climate. We have all sorts of other problems  like ocean acidification that come from CO  in the atmosphere  anyway. Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this. But here's a case which is harder to reject. Let's say that we don't do geo engineering  we do what we ought to do  which is get serious about cutting emissions. But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them. There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much. So let's say that we work hard  and we actually don't just tap the brakes  but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions and eventually reduce concentrations. And maybe someday    like       October       we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked and are rolling down the other side. And we have global celebrations  and we've actually started to    you know  we've seen the worst of it. But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet is really melting unacceptably fast  fast enough to put meters of sea level on the oceans in the next     years  and remove some of the biggest cities from the map. That's an absolutely possible scenario. We might decide at that point that even though geo engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy  that it's a lot better than not geo engineering. And that's a very different way to look at the problem. It's using this as risk control  not instead of action. It's saying that you do some geo engineering for a little while to take the worst of the heat off  not that you'd use it as a substitute for action. But there is a problem with that view. And the problem is the following  knowledge that geo engineering is possible makes the climate impacts look less fearsome  and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today. This is what economists call a moral hazard. And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about  and  in general  I think it's the underlying reason that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this. But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer. I'll leave you with three questions  and then one final quote. Should we do serious research on this topic  Should we have a national research program that looks at this  Not just at how you would do it better  but also what all the risks and downsides of it are. Right now  you have a few enthusiasts talking about it  some in a positive side  some in a negative side    but that's a dangerous state to be in because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic. A very small amount of money would get us some. Many of us    maybe now me    think we should do that. But I have a lot of reservations. My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem  and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard. I think there is a serious problem  as you talk about this  people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions. Another thing is  maybe we need a treaty. A treaty that decides who gets to do this. Right now we may think of a big  rich country like the U.S. doing this. But it might well be that  in fact  if China wakes up in      and realizes that the climate impacts are just unacceptable  they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this  and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo engineered world than a non geo engineered world. And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision. So here's one last thought  which was said much  much better    years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today. And I think it really summarizes where we are here. That the CO  problem  the climate problem that we've heard about  is driving lots of things    innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions    but also  I think  inevitably  it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control  whether we like it or not. And it's time to begin thinking about it  even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it. Thank you very much. What is bioenergy  Bioenergy is not ethanol. Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building that bridge to the future  to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way  or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff  is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do that  you really have to look first at agriculture. So we've been planting stuff for        years. And in the measure that we plant stuff  what we learn from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests  you've got to deal with all types of awful things  you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate  then you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile. You're going to be able to power stuff  so irrigation makes a difference. Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it  as opposed to where the rivers flood. You start getting this organic agriculture  you start putting machinery onto this stuff. Machinery  with a whole bunch of water  leads to very large scale agriculture. You put together machines and water  and you get landscapes that look like this. And then you get sales that look like this. It's brute force. So what you've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that's a reasonably natural system. You start taming that natural system. You put a lot of force behind that natural system. You put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides    end up with systems that look like this. And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've been approaching energy. So the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that's based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology. And you move from a discipline of engineering  you move from a discipline of chemistry  into a discipline of biology. And probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me. This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India and China no longer have these massive famines is because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of people have criticized. But of course  those are people who don't realize that China and India  instead of having huge amounts of starving people  are exporting grains. And the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research  which was Mexico  didn't adopt this technology  ignored this technology  talked about why this technology should be thought about  but not really applied. And Mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesn't apply technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in fact  hasn't recognized this man  to the point where there aren't statues of this man all over Mexico. There are in China and India. And the Institute that this guy ran has now moved to India. That is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies. Now  it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world. It's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does  if you understand biology. What happened in agriculture  Well  if you take agriculture over a century  agriculture in about      would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah  the plows look different. The machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules  but the farmer would have understood  this is what the guy's doing  this is why he's doing it  this is where he's going. What really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology  and that's where you get your productivity increases. And as you do that stuff  here's what happens to productivity. Basically  you go from     hours to produce     bushels  to     to     to five. Agricultural labor productivity increased seven times       to       whereas the rest of the economy increased about  .  times. This is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person. The effect of this  of course  is it's not just amber waves of grain  it is mountains of stuff. And    percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced. This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course  by now  you're probably saying to yourself   Self  I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology.  So where's the link between these two things  One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean  literally  it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption  and one of the best guesses in this stuff  is that this stuff comes out of this stuff  that these things absorb sunlight  rot under pressure for millions of years  and you get these black rivers. Now  the interesting thing about that thesis    if that thesis turns out to be true    is that oil  and all hydrocarbons  turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy  bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun  concentrating it in amoebas  concentrating it in plants  and maybe that's why you get these rainbows. And as you're looking at this system  if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight  then bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels. Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas  the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots. This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved  we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn  Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn  Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy. These are the Athabasca tar sands  and there's an enormous amount    first of mining  the largest trucks in the world are working here  and then you've got to pull out this black sludge  which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it  which only works at today's oil prices. Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants  except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure. So you take something like this  you burn it  you put it under pressure  and likely as not  you get this. Although  again  I stress  we don't know. Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But as you think of coal  this is what burned wheat kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. And of course  coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines  you get gas. When that gas blows up  people die. So you're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines  but not in others. Any place you see a differential  there're some interesting questions. There's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff. But again  coal. Maybe the same stuff  maybe the same system  maybe bioenergy  and you're applying exactly the same technology. Here's your brute force approach. Once you get through your brute force approach  then you just rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions  which are coal fired gas plants. That is probably not the best use of bioenergy. As you think of what are the alternatives to this system    it's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in its petroleum reserves  but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves  nor is China. There are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there  and we've got to start thinking of them as biological energy  because if we keep treating them as chemical energy  or engineering energy  we're going to be in deep doo doo. Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological product. And as you think of gas  well  you're familiar with gas. And here's a different way of mining coal. This is called coal bed methane. Why is this picture interesting  Because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life  the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another    the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up    may be because there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas. This is a well known phenomenon.  Laughter  You eat certain things  you produce a lot of gas. It may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process. If that is true  then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off  and it may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture. That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not importing corn into Iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture  from brute force into biological force. And in the measure that you can do that  you can clean some stuff  and you can clean it pretty quickly. We already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff. OK  if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades  you can get a really substantial increase  like an eight fold increase  in your output. This is just the beginning stages of this stuff. And as you think of biomaterials  this guy    who did part of the sequencing of the human genome  who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world    has been thinking about how you structure this. And there's a series of smart people thinking about this. And they've been putting together companies like Synthetic Genomics  like  a Cambria  like Codon  and what those companies are trying to do is to think of  how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force  Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes. Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the genes as a software. And in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable  that can become energy  that can become food  that can become fiber  that can become human beings  that can become a whole series of things  then you've got to shift your approach as to how you're going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way. What are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading  This is one of the gentle giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to cut genes    something called restriction enzymes. He was at Hopkins when he did this  and he's such a modest guy that the day he won  his mother called him and said   I didn't realize there was another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just won the Nobel    Laughter  I mean  that was Mom  but anyway  this guy is just a class act. You find him at the bench every single day  working on a pipette and building stuff. And one of the things this guy just built are these things. What is this  This is the first transplant of naked DNA  where you take an entire DNA operating system out of one cell  insert it into a different cell  and have that cell boot up as a separate species. That's one month old. You will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff. And as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are  we're going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies. We're going to start thinking about biology entering energy. It is very expensive to process this stuff  both in economic terms and in energy terms. This is what accumulates in the tar sands of Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you separate that petroleum from the sand  and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor    steam to separate this stuff    you also have to separate out the sulfur. The difference between light crude and heavy crude    well  it's about    bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way  the scale on these things is pretty large. Now  if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this  you reduce the system  and you really do start applying biological principles to energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind  to the point where you can get to solar  to the point where you can get to nuclear    and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault.  Laughter  Just a thought. But in the meantime  for the next decade at least  the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that oil  be that gas  be that coal  this is what we're dealing with. And before I make this talk too long  here's what's happening in the current energy system.    percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons. That means    percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a role in here for conservation. There's a role in here for alternative stuff  but we've also got to get that other portion right. How we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future. And as we think of this bridge to the future  one of the things you should ponder is  we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there. Which  of course  requires more energy to go out and get energy. The ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output. That is a stupid way of managing this system. Last point  last graph. One of the things that we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This is what oil prices look like  OK  This is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up with really smart ideas for solar panels  or for wind  or for something else  and then guess what  The oil price goes through the floor. That company goes out of business  and then you can bring the oil price back up. So if I had one closing and modest suggestion  let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the United States. How do you do that  Well  let's put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax  and it basically says for the next    years  the price of oil will be    whatever you want     bucks     bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that  we tax it. If the OPEC price goes above that  the tax goes away. What does that do for entrepreneurs  What does it do for companies  It tells people  if you can produce energy for less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel  or less than    bucks a barrel    let's debate it    you will have a business. But let's not put people through this cycle where it doesn't pay to research because your company will go out of business as OPEC drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening. Thank you. I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it  the problems and the opportunities that we face  and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic. And then I'll let you in on a secret  which is why I am an incurable optimist. Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before. Now  you've all seen  Inconvenient Truth.  This is a little more inconvenient. Because  with our present knowledge  we have no idea what would happen. Even now  man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization. Due to our release  through factories and automobiles every year  of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide    which helps air absorb heat from the sun    our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer. This is bad  Well  it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps. And if this happens  an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through     feet of tropical water. For  in weather  we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters  but with life itself. Larry Brilliant  Should we feel good  or should we feel bad that    years of foreknowledge accomplished so little  Well  it depends  really  on what your goals are. And I think  as my goals  I always go back to Gandhi's talisman. When Mahatma Gandhi was asked   How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one   he said   Consider the face of the poorest  most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon  and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person. And if it will be  it's the right thing to do  and if not  rethink it.  For those of us in this room  it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual  it's the community  it's the culture  it's the world itself. And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society  who are the poorest and the most vulnerable  the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism. But there's also a wonderful case for optimism. Let's review them both. First of all  the megatrends. There's two degrees  or three degrees of climate change baked into the system. It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands. It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable  as will the increasing rise of population. Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb  and we will not see    billion people in this decade  as he had forecast  we eat as if we were    billion. And we consume so much that again  a rise of  .  billion to  .  billion in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable. That's why they migrate to cities. That's why in June of this year  we passed  as a species     percent of us living in cities  and bustees  and slums  and shantytowns. The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did. The green revolution never reached Africa. And with desertification  sandstorms  the Gobi Desert  the Ogaden  we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even    years ago. So humans are turning more towards animal consumption. In Africa last year  Africans ate     million wild animals  and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat. And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted  the genomic sequences of which we don't know. Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of  but we are ripe for zoonotic borne  emerging communicable diseases. Increasingly  I would say explosive growth of technology. Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side    in bioweapons  and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger  hatred or feeling of marginalization. And in fact  with increasing globalization    for which there are big winners and even bigger losers    today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history. One percent of us own    percent of all the goods and services. What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next    years  The one percent will own even more than    percent of all the world's goods and services. Not because they've grown richer  but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer. Last week  Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said   This situation is unprecedented  unequal  unfair and unstable.  So there's lots of reason for pessimism. Darfur is  at its origin  a resource war. Last year  there were        riots in China      a day  that required police or military intervention. Most of them were about resources. We are facing an unprecedented number  scale of disasters. Some are weather related  human rights related  epidemics. And the newly emerging diseases may make H N  and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world. And unlike destabilized world in the past  it will be broadcast to you on YouTube  you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones. What will that lead to  For some  it will lead to anger  religious and sectarian violence and terrorism. For others  withdrawal  nihilism  materialism. For us  where does it take us  as social activists and entrepreneurs  As we look at these trends  do we become despondent  or will we become energized  Let's look at one case  the case of Bangladesh. First  even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today  global warming would continue. And even with global warming    if you can see these blue lines  the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today  the next decades will see rising sea levels. A minimum of    to    inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for  and it could be    times that. What will that do to Bangladesh  Let's take a look. So here's Bangladesh.    percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level. Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas. And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down  the deforested areas  here in the Tarai  will be unable to absorb the effluent  because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water. Now we're looking down south  through the Kali Gandaki. Many of you  I think  have probably trekked here. And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north  and in the seas rising from the south. Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh. And now let's look from the south  looking up  and let's see this in relief. A minimum of    to    inches of increase in seas  coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this. As many as     million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China. This is the difficulty that one country faces. But if you look at the globe  all around the earth  wherever there is low lying area  populated areas near the water  you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life. Sub Saharan Africa  and even our own San Francisco Bay Area. We're all in this together. This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know. Global warming is something that happens to all of us  all at once. As are these newly emerging communicable diseases  names that you hadn't heard    years ago  ebola  lhasa fever  monkey pox. With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans  we live in each other's viral environment. Do you remember     years ago  no one had ever heard of West Nile fever  And then we watched  as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year  westwardly. Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it  It's just the beginning  unfortunately. There have been    novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last    years. It's more than enough reason for pessimism. But now let's look at the case for optimism.  Laughter  Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge. You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves. We've been here before  paralyzed by fear  paralyzed into inaction  when some    probably one of you in this room    jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility  which fought against the nuclear threat  Medicins Sans Frontieres  that renewed our commitment to disaster relief  Mohamed ElBaradei  and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us  and our own Muhammad Yunus. We've seen the eradication of smallpox. We may see the eradication of polio this year. Last year  there were only       cases in the world. We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year    there are only        cases left in the world.    years ago  there were three and a half million. And we've seen a new disease  not like the    novel emerging communicable diseases. This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome.  Laughter  It's an amazing phenomenon. All throughout the technology world  we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome. But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did. They're not waiting until they die to create foundations. They're actively guiding their money  their resources  their hearts  their commitments  to make the world a better place. Certainly  nothing can give you more optimism than that. More reasons to be optimistic  in the '  s  and I am a creature of the '  s  there was a movement. We all felt that we were part of it  that a better world was right around the corner  that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice. Today  there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth. It's just beginning. Five weeks ago  a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment. Six months ago  a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB     the most far reaching legislation in environmental history. Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness. Can you imagine   Laughter  We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed  as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming. And now       churches have joined the environmental movement. It is something to be greatly optimistic about. The European          plan is an amazing breakthrough  something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon. And on April   th  there will be Step Up Day  where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation    pushing for legislation to stop global warming. And on July  th  around the world  I learned only yesterday  there will be global Live Earth concerts. And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air. Now  that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most. That means that people are beginning the first step  which is acting out of their own self interest. But I am seeing in the major funders  in CARE  Rockefeller  Rockefeller Brothers Fund  Hewlett  Mercy Corps  you guys  Google  so many other organizations  a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming  but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable. But for me  I have another reason to be an incurable optimist. And you've heard so many inspiring stories here  and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine. My background is not exactly conventional medical training. And I lived in a Himalayan monastery  and I studied with a very wise teacher  who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny    it felt like Yoda    it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox  at a time when there was no smallpox program. It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history. In the last century    that's the one that was seven years ago    half a billion people died from smallpox  more than all the wars in history  more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world. In the Summer of Love  in       two million people  children  died of smallpox. It's not ancient history. When you read the biblical plague of boils  that was smallpox. Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth  whose picture is here  died of smallpox. To eradicate smallpox  we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history. We visited every house in India  searching for smallpox        million houses  once every month  for nearly two years. In a cruel reversal  after we had almost conquered smallpox    and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur  the realm of the final inch. When we had almost eradicated smallpox  it came back again  because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers  who could come there and get employment. And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox  and they went home to die. And when they did  they took smallpox to    other countries and reignited the epidemic. And we had to start all over again. But  in the end  we succeeded  and the last case of smallpox  this little girl  Rahima Banu    Barisal  in Bangladesh    when she coughed or breathed  and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus  thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror. How can that not make you optimistic  A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India  and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India  ended. And most importantly for us here in this room  a bond was created. Doctors  health workers  from    different countries  of every race  every religion  every color  worked together  fought alongside each other  fought against a common enemy  didn't fight against each other. How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future  Thank you very much. I want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab. What I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design. And so here's the challenge  I want you to help me create a fully  D  dynamic  parameterized contact model. The translation of that is  could you help me build a foot  And it is a true challenge  and I do want you to help me. Of course  in the challenge there is a prize. It's not quite the TED Prize  but it is an exclusive t shirt from our lab. So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot. Now if we want to design a foot  what do we have to do  We have to first know what a foot is. If we go to the dictionary  it says   It's the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking  That's the traditional definition. But if you wanted to really do research  what do you have to do  You have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet. So you go to the literature.  Laughter  Maybe you're familiar with this literature. The problem is  there are many  many feet. How do you do this  You need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work. And I want you to help me do that in this next clip. As you see this clip  look for principles  and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works. See any common themes  Principles  What would you do  What experiments would you run  Wow.  Applause  Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot. It's a design inspired by nature  but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at  but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many  many feet. Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere. They can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw    in the probability of contact  the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present. If you want to study how a foot works  we're going to have to simulate those surfaces  or simulate that debris. When we did that  here's a new experiment that we did  we put an animal and had it run    this grass spider    on a surface with    percent of the contact area removed. But it didn't even slow down the animal. It's still running at the human equivalent of     miles per hour. Now how could it do that  Well  look more carefully. When we slow it down    times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris. The leg is acting as a foot. And in fact  the animal contacts other parts of its leg more frequently than the traditionally defined foot. The foot is distributed along the whole leg. You can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot  and you can remove its foot. I'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet. Without a foot  here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down. It can run the same speed without even that segment. No problem for the cockroach    they can grow them back  if you care. How do they do it  Look carefully  this is slowed down     times  and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg. It's acting  again  as a distributed foot    very effective. Now  the question we had is  how general is a distributed foot  And the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it. Journalists  this is off the record  it's embargoed. Take a look at what that is  That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut. It was discovered by Christina Huffard and filmed by Sea Studios  right here from Monterey. We've also described another species of bipedal octopus. This one disguises itself as floating algae. It walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen. And look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain. It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there    truly extraordinary. In       Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy. But we know that art imitates life  and it turns out nature  three million years ago  evolved the next animal. It's a shrimp like animal called the stomatopod  and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama  it actually rolls  and it can even roll uphill. It's the ultimate distributed foot  its whole body in this case is acting like its foot. So  if we want to then  to our blueprint  add the first important feature  we want to add distributed foot contact. Not just with the traditional foot  but also the leg  and even of the body. Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots  We biologically inspired this robot  named RHex  built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years. RHex's foot started off to be quite simple  then it got tuned over time  and ultimately resulted in this half circle. Why is that  The video will show you. Watch where the robot  now  contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain. What you'll see  in fact  is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot. Watch it go over this. You can see it here well on this debris. Extraordinary. No sensing  all the control is built right into the tuned legs. Really simple  but beautiful. Now  you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain. And my assistant's going to help me here. When you touched the cockroach leg    can you get the microphone for him  When you touched the cockroach leg  what did it feel like  Did you notice something  Boy  Spiny. Robert Full  It's spiny  right  It's really spiny  isn't it  It sort of hurts. Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach. Chris Anderson  Did you touch it  RF  So if you look carefully at this  what you see is that they have spines and until a few weeks ago  no one knew what they did. They assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures. We found that they're for something else    here's a segment of that spine. They're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris  but they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface. Now crabs don't miss footholds  because they normally move on sand    until they come to our lab. And where they have a problem with this kind of mesh  because they don't have spines. The crabs are missing spines  so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain. But of course  we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines. We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out. We did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs  as you see here  and then we tested them. Do we really understand that principle of tuning  The answer is  yes  This is slowed down    fold  and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris. A little better than nature. So to our blueprint  we need to add tuned spines. Now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots  Well  here's RHex  RHex has trouble on rails    on smooth rails  as you see here. So why not add a spine  My colleagues did this at U. Penn. Dan Koditschek put some steel nails    very simple version    on the robot  and here's RHex  now  going over those steel    those rails. No problem  How does it do it  Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action. Watch the leg come around  and you'll see it grab on right there. It couldn't do that before  it would just slip and get stuck and tip over. And watch again  right there    successful. Now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces. This is really  really difficult. But look at this animal do it  One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate. It's extraordinary how fast it can do it    but if you slow it down  you see something that's quite extraordinary. It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look    and doing  actually  terribly  with respect to grabbing on the surface. It looks  in fact  like it's swimming up the surface. We can actually model that behavior better as a fluid  if you look at it. The distributed foot  actually  is working more like a paddle. The same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand. Watch its feet. It's actually functioning as a paddle even though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid. This is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself. Can you use this to make a better robot  Martin Buehler did    who's now at Boston Dynamics    he took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex. So here's RHex with paddles  now converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot. For rough surfaces  though  animals add claws. And you probably feel them if you grabbed it. Did you touch it  CA  I did. RF  And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws. Mark Cutkosky at Stanford University  one of my collaborators  is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing  where he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot. And here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit. So to our blueprint  let's attach claws. Now if we look at animals  though  to be really maneuverable in all surfaces  the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws  and spines  and hairs  and pads  and glue  and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things. These are all from different insects. There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface. Let's look at that ant. This is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here. This is when its foot's in the air. Watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich. You see what happens  That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is. Here from underneath is an ant foot  and when the claws don't dig in  that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything. It just extrudes. And this was a hard shot to get    I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings. So it's pretty tough to do. This is what it looks like close up    here's the ant foot  and there's the glue. And we discovered this glue may be an interesting two phase mixture. It certainly helps it to hold on. So to our blueprint  we stick on some sticky pads. Now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here. Now we have something better here. The gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature. These are its feet. They're    almost look alien. And the secret  which they stick on with  involves their hairy toes. They can run up a surface at a meter per second  take    steps in that one second    you can hardly see them. If we slow it down  they attach their feet at eight milliseconds  and detach them in    milliseconds. And when you watch how they detach it  it is bizarre. They peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape. Very strange. How do they stick  If you look at their feet  they have leaf like structures called linalae with millions of hairs. And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible. It has a hundred to a thousand split ends  and that's the secret  because it allows intimate contact. The gecko has a billion of these     nanometer sized split ends. And they don't stick by glue  or they don't work like Velcro  or they don't work with suction. We discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone. So to our blueprint  we split some hairs. This has inspired the design of the first self cleaning dry adhesive    the patent issued  we're happy to say. And here's the simplest version in nature  and here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt at an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane. And here's the first attempt to have it work on some load. There's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields. You could think of a thousand possible uses  I'm sure. Lots of people have  and we're excited about realizing this as a product. We have imagined products  for example  this one  we imagined a bio inspired Band Aid  where we took the glue off the Band Aid. We took some hairs from a molting gecko  put three rolls of them on here  and then made this Band Aid. This is an undergraduate volunteer    we have        undergraduates so we can choose among them    that's actually just a red pen mark. But it makes an incredible Band Aid. It's aerated  it can be peeled off easily  it doesn't cause any irritation  it works underwater. I think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity based research    we just wondered how they climbed up something    can lead to things that you could never imagine. It's just an example of why we need to support curiosity based research. Here you are  pulling off the Band Aid. So we've redefined  now  what a foot is. The question is  can we use these secrets  then  to inspire the design of a better foot  better than one that we see in nature  Here's the new project  we're trying to create the first climbing search and rescue robot    no suction or magnets    that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces. I call the new robot RiSE  for  Robot in Scansorial Environment     that's a climbing environment    and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot. And here is RiSE. It's six legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree. And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline. You have the audio  You can hear it go up. And here it is coming up at you  in its first steps up a wall. Now it's only using its simplest feet here  so this is very new. But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot. Mark Cutkosky  though  is taking it a step further. He's the one able to build this shape deposition manufactured feet and toes. The next step is to make compliant toes  and try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives. So the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right  attempt to make that climb  and ultimately put it on the robot. And that's exactly what he's done. He's built  in fact  a climbing foot bot inspired by nature. And here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design. So these are tuned toes    there are six of them  and they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint. So this is not using any suction  any glue  and it will ultimately  when it's attached to the robot    it's as biologically inspired as the animal    hopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface. Here you see it  next  going up the side of a building at Stanford. It's sped up    again  it's a foot climbing. It's not the whole robot yet  we're working on it    now you can see how it's attaching. These tuned structures allow the spines  friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging  difficult surfaces. And so they were able to get this thing    this is now sped up    times    can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor  OK  You can visualize this now  it's not impossible. It's a very challenging task. But more to come later. To finish  we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built. We've learned we should distribute control to smart parts. Don't put it all in the brain  but put some of the control in tuned feet  legs and even body. That nature uses hybrid solutions  not a single solution  to these problems  and they're integrated and beautifully robust. And third  we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology  and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make    potentially    something better than nature. So there's a clear message  whether you care about a fundamental  basic research of really interesting  bizarre  wonderful animals  or you want to build a search and rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake  or to save someone in a fire  or you care about medicine  we must preserve nature's designs. Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you. I want to start my story in Germany  in       with a mathematician named Georg Cantor. And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line  and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process  a recursive process. So he starts out with one line  and then two  and then four  and then     and so on. And if he does this an infinite number of times  which you can do in mathematics  he ends up with an infinite number of lines  each of which has an infinite number of points in it. So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity. And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium.  Laughter  And when he came out of the sanitarium  he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself. He was a very religious man. He was a mathematician on a mission. And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing. A Swedish mathematician  von Koch  decided that instead of subtracting lines  he would add them. And so he came up with this beautiful curve. And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape  we can use any seed shape we like. And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere    down there  OK    and now upon iteration  that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure. So these all have the property of self similarity  the part looks like the whole. It's the same pattern at many different scales. Now  mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down  you measure a longer and longer length. And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times  as the ruler shrinks down to infinity  the length goes to infinity. This made no sense at all  so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books. They said these are pathological curves  and we don't have to discuss them. And that worked for a hundred years. And then in       Benoit Mandelbrot  a French mathematician  realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals  you get the shapes of nature. You get the human lungs  you get acacia trees  you get ferns  you get these beautiful natural forms. If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet    go ahead and do that now       and relax your hand  you'll see a crinkle  and then a wrinkle within the crinkle  and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right  Your body is covered with fractals. The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes  They were breathing those words with fractal lungs. It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here. Again  we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape. So here's the second iteration  and the third  fourth and so on. So nature has this self similar structure. Nature uses self organizing systems. Now in the     s  I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village  you see fractals. And I thought   This is fabulous  I wonder why   And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why. So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals  which is a great job if you can get it. And so I finally got to this city  and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold    but when I got there  I got to the palace of the chief  and my French is not very good  I said something like   I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof.  But he was really cool about it  and he took me up there  and we talked about fractals. And he said   Oh yeah  yeah  We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle  we know all about that.  And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle  and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here. And as you go through the path  you have to get more and more polite. So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling  it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. This is a village in southern Zambia. The Ba ila built this village about     meters in diameter. You have a huge ring. The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back  and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back and then the chief's immediate family in that ring. So here's a little fractal model for it. Here's one house with the sacred altar  here's the house of houses  the family enclosure  with the humans here where the sacred altar would be  and then here's the village as a whole    a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here  the chief's immediate family here  and here there's a tiny village only this big. Now you might wonder  how can people fit in a tiny village only this big  That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors. And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village  right  So it's just like Georg Cantor said  the recursion continues forever. This is in the Mandara mountains  near the Nigerian border in Cameroon  Mokoulek. I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect  and I thought   Wow  What a beautiful fractal   So I tried to come up with a seed shape  which  upon iteration  would unfold into this thing. I came up with this structure here. Let's see  first iteration  second  third  fourth. Now  after I did the simulation  I realized the whole village kind of spirals around  just like this  and here's that replicating line    a self replicating line that unfolds into the fractal. Well  I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at. So  when I got to the village  I said   Can you take me to the square building  I think something's going on there.  And they said   Well  we can take you there  but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar  where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields.  And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this. And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales. So here's a Nankani village in Mali. And you can see  you go inside the family enclosure    you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace  stacked recursively. Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us  and they're stacked recursively. Now  the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul. And when she dies  they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity. Once again  infinity is important. Now  you might ask yourself three questions at this point. Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture  And that was actually my original hypothesis. When I first saw those African fractals  I thought   Wow  so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society  that sort of hierarchy  must have a kind of bottom up architecture.  But that turns out not to be true. I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture  only the African ones were fractal. And if you think about it  all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry. You can see on the pottery and the baskets. Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins  you can see it's circular at the largest scale  but it's rectangular at the smaller scale  right  It is not the same pattern at two different scales. Second  you might ask   Well  Dr. Eglash  aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures   And three times  the answer is no. First of all  I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book   The Invention of Africa   that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism  and then oppositional movements. No  because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture    and it definitely is not  in the DNA.  And finally  the fractals have self similarity    so they're similar to themselves  but they're not necessarily similar to each other    you see very different uses for fractals. It's a shared technology in Africa. And finally  well  isn't this just intuition  It's not really mathematical knowledge. Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry  right  It wasn't invented until the     s. Well  it's true that some African fractals are  as far as I'm concerned  just pure intuition. So some of these things  I'd wander around the streets of Dakar asking people   What's the algorithm  What's the rule for making this   and they'd say   Well  we just make it that way because it looks pretty  stupid.   Laughter  But sometimes  that's not the case. In some cases  there would actually be algorithms  and very sophisticated algorithms. So in Manghetu sculpture  you'd see this recursive geometry. In Ethiopian crosses  you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape. In Angola  the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand  and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph  we now call it an Eulerian path    you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice. But they do it recursively  and they do it with an age grade system  so the little kids learn this one  and then the older kids learn this one  then the next age grade initiation  you learn this one. And with each iteration of that algorithm  you learn the iterations of the myth. You learn the next level of knowledge. And finally  all over Africa  you see this board game. It's called Owari in Ghana  where I studied it  it's called Mancala here on the East Coast  Bao in Kenya  Sogo elsewhere. Well  you see self organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game. And the folks in Ghana knew about these self organizing patterns and would use them strategically. So this is very conscious knowledge. Here's a wonderful fractal. Anywhere you go in the Sahel  you'll see this windscreen. And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian  all strictly linear. But here in Africa  you've got these nonlinear scaling fences. So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things  this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako  and I asked him   How come you're making fractal fences  Because nobody else is.  And his answer was very interesting. He said   Well  if I lived in the jungle  I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap. It doesn't take much time  doesn't take much straw.  He said   but wind and dust goes through pretty easily. Now  the tight rows up at the very top  they really hold out the wind and dust. But it takes a lot of time  and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight.   Now   he said   we know from experience that the farther up from the ground you go  the stronger the wind blows.  Right  It's just like a cost benefit analysis. And I measured out the lengths of straw  put it on a log log plot  got the scaling exponent  and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook. So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology. The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry  it was in a symbolic code  and this was Bamana sand divination. And the same divination system is found all over Africa. You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast  and often the symbols are very well preserved  so each of these symbols has four bits    it's a four bit binary word    you draw these lines in the sand randomly  and then you count off  and if it's an odd number  you put down one stroke  and if it's an even number  you put down two strokes. And they did this very rapidly  and I couldn't understand where they were getting    they only did the randomness four times    I couldn't understand where they were getting the other    symbols. And they wouldn't tell me. They said   No  no  I can't tell you about this.  And I said   Well look  I'll pay you  you can be my teacher  and I'll come each day and pay you.  They said   It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter.  And finally  out of desperation  I said   Well  let me explain Georg Cantor in     .  And I started explaining why I was there in Africa  and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set. And one of them said   Come here. I think I can help you out here.  And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest. And of course  I was only interested in the math  so the whole time  he kept shaking his head going   You know  I didn't learn it this way.  But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed  buried in sand  and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on. And finally  he revealed the truth of the matter. And it turns out it's a pseudo random number generator using deterministic chaos. When you have a four bit symbol  you then put it together with another one sideways. So even plus odd gives you odd. Odd plus even gives you odd. Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even. It's addition modulo    just like in the parity bit check on your computer. And then you take this symbol  and you put it back in so it's a self generating diversity of symbols. They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this. Now  because it's a binary code  you can actually implement this in hardware    what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools. And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical. In the   th century  Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain. And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy  divination through the earth. This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in     . Leibniz  the German mathematician  talked about geomancy in his dissertation called  De Combinatoria.  And he said   Well  instead of using one stroke and two strokes  let's use a one and a zero  and we can count by powers of two.  Right  Ones and zeros  the binary code. George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra  and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer. So all these little PDAs and laptops    every digital circuit in the world    started in Africa. And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers  but you know  I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno. So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this. And you can go to our website  the applets are all free  they just run in the browser. Anybody in the world can use them. The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools  so hopefully in three years  anybody'll be able to go on the Web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts. We've focused in the U.S. on African American students as well as Native American and Latino. We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software. So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics  that it's not just about singing and dancing. We've started a pilot program in Ghana. We got a small seed grant  just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this  we're very excited about the future possibilities for that. We've also been working in design. I didn't put his name up here    my colleague  Kerry  in Kenya  has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure  because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village  it doesn't quite fit. Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art. David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture in which he's used some of these fractal structures. And finally  I just wanted to point out that this idea of self organization  as we heard earlier  it's in the brain. It's in the    it's in Google's search engine. Actually  the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self organizing properties of the web. It's in ecological sustainability. It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship  the ethical power of democracy. It's also in some bad things. Self organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast. And if you don't think that capitalism  which is self organizing  can have destructive effects  you haven't opened your eyes enough. So we need to think about  as was spoken earlier  the traditional African methods for doing self organization. These are robust algorithms. These are ways of doing self organization    of doing entrepreneurship    that are gentle  that are egalitarian. So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work  we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self organizing algorithms. Thank you. You will understand nothing with my type of English. It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people. I must tell you I am like that  not very comfortable  because usually  in life  I think my job is absolutely useless. I mean  I feel useless. Now after Carolyn  and all the other guys  I feel like shit. And definitively  I don't know why I am here  but    you know the nightmare you can have  like you are an impostor  you arrive at the opera  and they push you   You must sing   I don't know.  Laughter  So  so  because I have nothing to show  nothing to say  we shall try to speak about something else. We can start  if you want  by understanding    it's just to start  it's not interesting  but    how I work. When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known  I mean  yes  lemon squeezer  toilet brush  toothpick  beautiful toilet seats  and why not    a toothbrush  I don't try to design the toothbrush. I don't try to say   Oh  that will be a beautiful object   or something like that. That doesn't interest me. Because there is different types of design. The one  we can call it the cynical design  that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '  s  who said  what is ugly is a bad sale  la laideur se vend mal  which is terrible. It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing  for producer to make product more sexy  like that  they sell more  it's shit  it's obsolete  it's ridiculous. I call that the cynical design. After  there is the narcissistic design  it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers.  Laughter  After  there is people like me  who try to deserve to exist  and who are so ashamed to make this useless job  who try to do it in another way  and they try  I try  to not make the object for the object but for the result  for the profit for the human being  the person who will use it. If we take the toothbrush    I don't think about the toothbrush. I think   What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth   And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth  I must imagine  Who owns this mouth  What is the life of the owner of this mouth  In what society  does  this guy live  What civilization creates this society  What animal species creates this civilization  When I arrive    and I take one minute  I am not so intelligent    when I arrive at the level of animal species  that becomes real interesting. Me  I have strictly no power to change anything. But when I come back  I can understand why I shall not do it  because today to not do it  it's more positive than do it  or how I shall do it. But to come back  where I am at the animal species  there is things to see. There is things to see  there is the big challenge. The big challenge in front of us. Because there is not a human production which exists outside of what I call  the big image.  The big image is our story  our poetry  our romanticism. Our poetry is our mutation  our life. We must remember  and we can see that in any book of my son of    years old  that life appears four billion years ago  around    four billion point two  Voice offstage  Four point five. Yes  point five  OK  OK  OK   Laughter  I'm a designer  that's all  of Christmas gifts. And before  there was this soup  called  soupe primordiale   this first soup    bloop bloop bloop    sort of dirty mud  no life  nothing. So then    pshoo shoo    lightning    pshoo    arrive    pshoo shoo    makes life    bloop bloop    and that dies. Some million years after    pshoo shoo  bloop bloop    ah  wake up  At the end  finally  that succeeds  and life appears. We was so  so stupid. The most stupid bacteria. Even  I think  we copy our way to reproduce  you know what I mean  and something of    oh no  forget it. After  we become a fish  after  we become a frog  after  we become a monkey  after  we become what we are today  a super monkey  and the fun is  the super monkey we are today  is at half of the story. Can you imagine  From that stupid bacteria to us  with a microphone  with a computer  with an iPod  four billion years. And we know  and especially Carolyn knows  that when the sun will implode  the earth will burn  explode  I don't know what  and this is scheduled for four  four billion years  Yes  she said  something like that. OK  that means we are at half of the story. Fantastic  It's a beauty  Can you imagine  It's very symbolic. Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today. And today  we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years. And this territory is fantastic. That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story. It's our romanticism. Mu ta tion. We are mutants. And if we don't deeply understand  if we don't integrate that we are mutants  we completely miss the story. Because every generation thinks we are the final one. We have a way to look at Earth like that  you know   I am the man. The final man. You know  we mutate during four billion years before  but now  because it's me  we stop. Fin.  Laughter  For the end  for the eternity  it is one with a red jacket.  Something like that. I am not sure of that.  Laughter  Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that. There is so many things to do  it's so fresh. And here is something  nobody is obliged to be a genius  but everybody is obliged to participate. And to participate  for a mutant  there is a minimum of exercise  a minimum of sport. We can say that. The first  if you want    there is so many    but one which is very easy to do  is the duty of vision. I can explain you. I shall try. If you walk like that  it's OK  it's OK  you can walk  but perhaps  because you walk with the eyes like that  you will not see  oh  there is a hole. And you will fall  and you will die. Dangerous. That's why  perhaps  you will try to have this angle of vision. OK  I can see  if I found something  up  up  and they continue  up up up. I raise the angle of vision  but it's still very    selfish  selfish  egoiste    yes  selfish. You  you survive. It's OK. If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go   I see you  oh my God you are here  how are you  I can help you  I can design for you a new toothbrush  new toilet brush   something like that. I live in society  I live in community. It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence  we can say. From this level  the more you can raise this angle of view  the more you will be important for the society. The more you will rise  the more you will be important for the civilization. The more you will rise  to see far and high  like that  the more you will be important for the story of our mutation. That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence. From this to here  that  it's genius. Ptolemy  Eratosthenes  Einstein  things like that. Nobody's obliged to be a genius. It's better  but nobody. Take care  in this training  to be a good mutant. There is some danger  there is some trap. One trap  the vertical. Because at the vertical of us  if you look like that   Ah  my God  there is God. Ah  God   God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer. That means  when your brain is not enough big  when you don't understand  you go   Ah  it's God  it's God.  That's ridiculous. That's why    jump  like that  No  don't jump. Come back. Because  after  there is another trap. If you look like that  you look to the past  or you look inside if you are very flexible  inside yourself. It's called schizophrenia  and you are dead also. That's why every morning  now  because you are a good mutant  you will raise your angle of view. Out  more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence. Never forget    like that  like that. It's very  very  very important. What  what else we can say about that  Why do that  It's because we    if we look from far  we see our line of evolution. This line of evolution is clearly positive. From far  this line looks very smooth  like that. But if you take a lens  like that  this line is ack  ack  ack  ack  ack. Like that. It's made of light and shadow. We can say light is civilization  shadow is barbaria. And it's very important to know where we are. Because some cycle  there is a spot in the cycle  and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle. That means  we can imagine    I don't say it was fantastic  but in the '  s  there was not too much war  like that  it was    we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized. In this case  people like me are acceptable. We can say   It's luxurious time.  We have time to think  we have time to I don't know what  speak about art and things like that. It's OK. We are in the light. But sometimes  like today  we fall  we fall so fast  so fast to shadow  we fall so fast to barbaria. With many  many  many  many face of barbaria. Because it's not  the barbaria we have today  it's perhaps not the barbaria we think. There is different type of barbaria. That's why we must adapt. That means  when barbaria is back  forget the beautiful chairs  forget the beautiful hotel  forget design  even    I'm sorry to say    forget art. Forget all that. There is priority  there is urgency. You must go back to politics  you must go back to radicalization  I'm sorry if that's not very English. You must go back to fight  to battle. That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job. That's why I am here  to try to do it the best possible. But I know that even I do it the best possible    that's why I'm the best    it's nothing. Because it's not the right time. That's why I say that. I say that  because  I repeat  nothing exist if it's not in the good reason  the reason of our beautiful dream  of this civilization. And because we must all work to finish this story. Because the scenario of this civilization    about love  progress  and things like that    it's OK  but there is so many different  other scenarios of other civilizations. This scenario  of this civilization  was about becoming powerful  intelligent  like this idea we have invented  this concept of God. We are God now. We are. It's almost done. We have just to finish the story. That is very  very important. And when you don't understand really what's happened  you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that. You go to the future back  back  back  back  like that. And you can fall  and it's very dangerous. No  you must really understand that. Because we have almost finished  I'll repeat this story. And the beauty of this  in perhaps    years     years  we can finish completely this civilization  and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story  a new poetry  a new romanticism. With billions of people who have been born  worked  lived and died before us  these people who have worked so much  we have now bring beautiful things  beautiful gifts  we know so many things. We can say to our children  OK  done  that was our story. That passed. Now you have a duty  invent a new story. Invent a new poetry. The only rule is  we have not to have any idea about the next story. We give you white pages. Invent. We give you the best tools  the best tools  and now  do it. That's why I continue to work  even if it's for toilet brush. Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here. Now  I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments  normally. I'm a theorist. But I'm going see what happens if I press this button. Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles. What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine  What is it made of  And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe  and they're very much connected with the history of the universe. We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more  but those are at very  very small distances  and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet. The main thing I want to talk about is this  that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory. And why on earth could that be so  Well  here's an example from my own experience. It's fairly dramatic  actually  to have this happen. Three or four of us  in       put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces  this weak force. And it was in disagreement with seven    seven  count them  seven experiments. Experiments were all wrong. And we published before knowing that  because we figured it was so beautiful  it's gotta be right  The experiments had to be wrong  and they were. Now our friend over there  Albert Einstein  used to pay very little attention when people said   You know  there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity. DC Miller. What about that   And he would say   Aw  that'll go away.   Laughter  Now  why does stuff like that work  That's the question. Now  yeah  what do we mean by beautiful  That's one thing. I'll try to make that clear    partially clear. Why should it work  and is this something to do with human beings  I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer  and that is  it has nothing to do with human beings. Somewhere in some other planet  orbiting some very distant star  maybe in a another galaxy  there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are  and are interested in science. It's not impossible  I think there probably are lots. Very likely  none is close enough to interact with us. But they could be out there  very easily. And suppose they have  you know  very different sensory apparatus  and so on. They have seven tentacles  and they have    little funny looking compound eyes  and a brain shaped like a pretzel. Would they really have different laws  There are lots of people who believe that  and I think it is utter baloney. I think there are laws out there  and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well    but we try. And we try to get closer and closer. And someday  we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces  what I call the  fundamental law.  We may not even be terribly far from it. But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes  we can still think there is one out there  and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it. I think that's the main point to be made. We express these things mathematically. And when the mathematics is very simple    when in terms of some mathematical notation  you can write the theory in a very brief space  without a lot of complication    that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance. Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there. Newton certainly believed that. And he said  here   It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws.  The basic law  let's say    here's an assumption. The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles. Now  some people call that a theory of everything. That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical. And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like  and so on. You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway.  Laughter  There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff. But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities. Now  sometimes those probabilities are near certainties. And in a lot of familiar cases  they of course are. But other times they're not  and you have only probabilities for different outcomes. So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law. It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents  or chance outcomes  that are there in addition. And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes  they are in addition. So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact  a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents  and not just from the fundamental laws. Now  it's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies  and then higher energies  and then higher energies  or short distances  and then shorter distances  and then still shorter distances  and so on  is like peeling the skin of an onion. And we keep doing that  and build more powerful machines  accelerators for particles. We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles  and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. Now  what happens is that as we do that  as we peel these skins of the onion  and we get closer and closer to the underlying law  we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one  and with the next one. We write them out mathematically  and we see they use very similar mathematics. They require very similar mathematics. That is absolutely remarkable  and that is a central feature of what I'm trying to say today. Newton called it    that's Newton  by the way    that one. This one is Albert Einstein. Hi  Al  And anyway  he said   nature conformable to herself     personifying nature as a female. And so what happens is that the new phenomena  the new skins  the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to  resemble the slightly larger ones. And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin. And that's why the equations look so simple. Because they use mathematics we already have. A trivial example is this  Newton found the law of gravity  which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated. Coulomb  in France  found the same law for electric charges. Here's an example of this similarity. You look at gravity  you see a certain law. Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule. It's a very simple example. There are lots of more sophisticated examples. Symmetry is very important in this discussion. You know what it means. A circle  for example  is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle. You rotate around the center of the circle  the circle remains unchanged. You take a sphere  in three dimensions  you rotate around the center of the sphere  and all those rotations leave the sphere alone. They are symmetries of the sphere. So we say  in general  that there's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon  or its description  unchanged. Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space. Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle  it doesn't leave the    doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism. There's a new notation in the   th century that expressed this  and if you use that notation  the equations get a lot simpler. Then Einstein  with his special theory of relativity  looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations  which are called special relativity. And those symmetries  then  make the equations even shorter  and even prettier  therefore. Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean  doesn't make any difference. But you can just look at the form.  Laughter  You can look at the form. You see above  at the top  a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space  x  y and z. Then  using vector analysis  you use rotational symmetry  and you get this next set. Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here  showing that symmetry exhibits better and better. The more and more symmetry you have  the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory. The last two  the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields. The next    second    equation says that there is no magnetism other than that. The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents. Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument. But for the moment  that's the case. Now  here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of. They should have heard of it  but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail  so I won't do it. I'll just mention it.  Laughter  But Chen Ning Yang  called by us  Frank  Yang     Laughter     and Bob Mills put forward     years ago  this generalization of Maxwell's equations  with a new symmetry. A whole new symmetry. Mathematics very similar  but there was a whole new symmetry. They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics    didn't. It didn't  by itself  contribute to particle physics. But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did  And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force. So here we say  again  what we said before  that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins. So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one. And therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely  concise way. So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities. Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity. Symmetry exhibits the simplicity. And then there is self similarity across the scales    in other words  from one skin of the onion to another one. Proximate self similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon. That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory. Here's what Newton himself said   Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self.  One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today  but in his day it wasn't taken for granted. There's the story  which is not absolutely certain to be right  but a lot of people told it. Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge  and he went down to his mother's farm    because the university was closed    he saw an apple fall from a tree  or on his head or something. And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon. That was a big unification for those days  although today we take it for granted. It's the same theory of gravity. So he said that this principle of nature  consonance   This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers  I forbore to describe it in that book  lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ...   That's what we all have to watch out for   Laughter  especially at this meeting.   ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book.  Now  who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind  That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around  and so on  Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation. It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can  of course  appreciate it and enjoy it  use it  but it's not    it doesn't stem from the human mind. It stems from the character of gravity. And that's true of all the things we're talking about. They are properties of the fundamental law. The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another  and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin. I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year  gravity  the laws of motion  the calculus  white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow. And he could have written quite an essay on  What I Did Over My Summer Vacation.  So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates. They follow from the fundamental theory. They are what we call emergent properties. You don't need    you don't need something more to get something more. That's what emergence means. Life can emerge from physics and chemistry  plus a lot of accidents. The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents  the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents. It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things  plus accidents. That's a general rule  and it's critically important to realize that. You don't need something more in order to get something more. People keep asking that when they read my book   The Quark and the Jaguar   and they say   Isn't there something more beyond what you have there   Presumably  they mean something supernatural. Anyway  there isn't.  Laughter  You don't need something more to explain something more. Thank you very much.  Applause  The old story about climate protection is that it's costly  or it would have been done already. So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it. The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly  but profitable. This was a simple sign error  because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel  as is well known to companies that do it all the time    for example  Dupont  SD micro electronics. Many other firms    IBM    are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants  and they get their money back in two or three years. That's called a profit. Now  similarly  the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it  it would be expensive  or we would have done it already  because markets are essentially perfect. If  of course  that were true  there would be no innovation  and nobody could make any money. But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil    not just incrementally  but completely    quite the contrary. The United States  for example  can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time  led by business for profit  because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it. This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict  particularly over oil. This thesis is set out in a book called  Winning the Oil Endgame  that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame.com    about         downloads so far. And it was co sponsored by the Pentagon    it's independent  it's peer reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal. Now  a bit of economic history  I think  may be helpful here. Around       one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling. And whale oil lit practically every building. But in the nine years before Drake struck oil  in       at least five sixths of that whale oil illuminating market disappeared  thanks to fatal competitors  chiefly oil and gas made from coal  to which the whalers had not been paying attention. So  very unexpectedly  they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales. The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit maximizing capitalists. And it's funny    it feels a bit like this now for oil. We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil  and no one had bothered to add them up before. So when we did  we found some very surprising things. Now  there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil. Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk. On the competitiveness front  we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together. And serious competition from Europe  from Korea  and next is China  which will soon be a major net exporter of cars. How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally badged Shanghai automotive super efficient car  Maybe a decade  according to my friends in Detroit. China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology. They're not going to export your uncle's Buick. And after that comes India. The point here is  these cars are going to be made super efficient. The question is  who will make them  Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil  or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars  That seems to make more sense. The more we keep on using the oil  particularly the imported oil  the more we face a very obvious array of problems. Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing  but nothing is not the right number. It could well be enough to double the oil price  for example. And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil  if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil. And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far off istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens. They don't like fighting over oil  they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates. Now  in order to avoid these problems  whatever you think they're worth  it's actually not that complicated. We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently  at a cost of    dollars per saved barrel. And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas. And that costs on average under    dollars a barrel. And compared with the official forecast  that oil will cost    dollars a barrel in       which is half of what we've been paying lately  that will save    billion dollars a year  starting quite soon. Now  in order to do this we need to invest about     billion dollars  half of it to retool the car  truck and plane industries  half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry. In the process  we will gain about a million good jobs  mainly rural. And protect another million jobs now at risk  mainly in auto making. And we'll also get returns over     billion dollars a year. So that's a very handsome return. It's financeable in the private capital market. But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned  to happen sooner and with higher confidence  then    and also to expand choice and manage risk    then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic. And these policies work fine without taxes  subsidies or mandates. They make a little net money for the treasury. They have a broad trans ideological appeal  and because we want them actually to happen  we figured out ways to do them that do not require much  if any  federal legislation  and can  indeed  be done administratively or at a state level. Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem  namely  light vehicles  here are four ultra light carbon composite concept cars with low drag  and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive. You can sort of have it all with these things. For example  this Opel two seater does     miles an hour at    miles a gallon. This muscle car from Toyota      horsepower in an ultra light that does zero to    in well under four seconds  and still gets    miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this. And in the upper left  a pioneering effort    years ago by GM       miles a gallon without even using a hybrid  in a four seater. Well  saving that fuel     percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about    cents per saved gallon. But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks  where you save a similar amount at    cents a gallon  with better aerodynamics and tires and engines  and so on  and taking out weight so you can put it into payload. So you can double efficiency with a    percent internal rate of return. Then you can go even further  almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements  double the big haulers' margins. And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull  and flip the market. In the airplane business  it's again a similar story where the first    percent fuel saving is free  as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner. But then the next generation of planes saves about half. Again  much cheaper than buying the fuel. And if you go over the next    years or so to a blended wing body  kind of a flying wing with internal engines  then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost. Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles  the cars and light trucks  because we all know the most about those  probably everybody here drives one. And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan  of all the fuel energy you feed into the car  seven eighths never gets to the wheels  it's lost first in the engine  idling at zero miles a gallon  the power train and accessories. So then of the energy that does get to the wheels  only an eighth of it  half of that  goes to heat the tires on the road  or to heat the air the car pushes aside. And only this little bit  only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop. In fact  since    percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver  less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver. This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort. Moreover  three fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car. And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels. So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter. And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that    well  then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car  and it would cost a lot more to make  because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium. But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials. For example  we use a lot of carbon fiber composites in sporting goods. And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety. Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t boned by a Golf. The Golf was totaled. The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel. They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later. But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at    miles an hour  the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon fiber composite cones  weighing a total of    pounds  hidden in the front end. Because these materials could actually absorb six to    times as much energy per pound as steel  and do so a lot more smoothly. And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight. We could make cars bigger  which is protective  but make them light. Whereas if we made them heavy  they'd be both hostile and inefficient. And when you make them light in the right way  that can be simpler and cheaper to make. You can end up saving money  and lives  and oil  all at the same time. I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic  uncompromised  quintupled efficiency suburban assault vehicle       and this is a complete virtual design that is production costed manufacturable. And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely. We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff  strong  carbon composite material  and then ways to thermoform it  because it's a combination of carbon and nylon  into whatever complex shapes you want  like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier one suppliers. And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified. Because the auto body has only  say     parts  instead of         . Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set  instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel. Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist. They snap together like a kid's toy. So you got rid of the body shop. And if you want  you can lay color in the mold  and get rid of the paint shop. Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car. So you end up with at least two fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry  which GM has in Lansing. The plant also gets smaller. Now  when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil  including buildings  industry  feedstocks and so on  you find that of the    million barrels a day the government says we will need in       well  about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then  with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over  at an average cost of only    bucks a barrel  instead of    for buying the oil. And then another six can be made robustly  competitively  from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel  without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production. There is a huge amount of gas to be saved  about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price. And here are some no brainer substitutions of it  with lots left over. So much  in fact  that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved  you have only this little bit left  and let's see how we can meet that  because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways. We could  of course  buy more efficiency. Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at    bucks instead of   . Or wait to capture the second half of it. Or we could  of course  just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil  or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us. But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead  because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers  and they don't. Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance  or if we used it as hydrogen  which is more profitable and efficient  we'd get rid of the domestic oil too. And that doesn't even count  for example  that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country. So we have lots of options. And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible. Now  to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence  there is a few ways government could help. For example  fee bates  a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want  can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles. You're not paid to change size class. You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class  in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three. This expands choice rapidly in the market  and actually makes more money for automakers as well. I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low income families to get efficient  reliable  warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get. And for each car so financed  scrap almost one clunker  preferably the dirtiest ones. This creates a new million car a year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise  because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car. And Detroit will make money on every unit. It turns out that if  say  African American and white households had the same car ownership  it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities. So this is a huge social win  too. Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year. There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster. And we could even do an X Prize style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for. For example  a billion dollar prize for the first U.S. automaker to sell         really advanced vehicles  like some you saw earlier. Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills  but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that  there are ways to finance it. And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes  so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air  they would waste more oil  and block the uptake of efficient  new planes. Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive. We ought to take them out back and shoot them  and put bounty hunters after them. Then there's an important military role. That in creating the move to high volume  low cost commercial production of these kinds of materials  or for that matter  ultra light steels that are a good backup technology  the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet. Just turn it over to the private sector  and we have an Internet. The same for GPS. The same for the modern semi conductor industry. That is  military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil  which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security. Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining  and shift the convergence of the energy and ag value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates  and get out of our own way in other ways. And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster. But here's how the whole thing fits together. Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up  they can turn down with the    dollars a barrel efficiency  down steeply by adding the supply side substitutions at    bucks  all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention. And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there  we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the     s. And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before. In this eight year period       to     when we last paid attention  the economy grew    percent  oil use fell    percent  oil imports fell    percent  oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell    percent. They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year. Well  that was with very old technologies and delivery methods. We could rerun that play a lot better now. And yet what we proved then is the U.S. has more market power than OPEC. Ours is on the demand side. We are the Saudi Arabia of  nega barrels.   Laughter  We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil. Whatever your reason for wanting to do this  whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility       or jobs  or the planet  or your grand kids  it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win. Please download your copy  and thank you very much. Good morning  ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin  and I am a  mathemagician.  What that means is  I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call  mathemagics.  But before I get started  I have a quick question for the audience. By any chance  did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator  Seriously  if you have a calculator with you  raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up  Now bring it out  bring it out. Anybody else  I see  I see one way in the back. You sir  that's three. And anybody on this side here  OK  over there on the aisle. Would the four of you please bring out your calculators  then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. That's right. Now  since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators  I need to make sure that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number  please  How about a two digit number  Audience    . AB    . And another two digit number  sir  Audience    . AB  Multiply    times     make sure you get        or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get               Volunteer  No. AB     . Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there. Would you like to try a more standard calculator  just in case  OK  great. What I'm going to try and do then    I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator. There is something called the square of a number  which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself. For instance  five squared would be  Audience    . AB    . The way we can square on most calculators    let me demonstrate with this one    is by taking the number  such as five  hitting  times  and then  equals   and on most calculators that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators  you've got an  x squared  button on it  will allow you to do the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do now is to square  in my head  four two digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators  even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time  and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two digit number  and if you would square the first number  and if you would square the second  the third and the fourth  I will try and race you to the answer. OK  So quickly  a two digit number please. Audience    . Arthur Benjamin     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK. Audience    . AB     squared  OK  and finally  Audience    . AB     squared. Would you call out your answers  please  Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer     . AB     . Volunteer      . AB      . Volunteer      . AB  Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down    I'll just call them out as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to  call out a three digit number. Anyone on our panel  verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three digit number  sir  yes  Audience     . AB      squared is        . AB  Yes  Good. Another three digit       another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      squared is        .          AB  Yes  OK  another  another three digit number  sir  Audience     . AB      is        .        . Yes  One more three digit number please. Audience  Oh     . AB      is      that's a harder one. Is that          Volunteer  Yes. AB  Yes  Oh  one more  one more three digit number please. Audience     .     squared is       . Volunteer  Yes. Thank you very much. Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square a four digit number this time. You can all take your time on this  I will not beat you to the answer on this one  but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random  let's take the fourth row this time  let's say  one  two  three  four. If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine  that will be the four digit number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight.        this will take me a little bit of time  so bear with me.    million             Volunteer  Yes  AB  Thank you very much. Now  I would attempt to square a five digit number    and I can    but unfortunately  most calculators cannot. Eight digit capacity    don't you hate that  So  since we've reached the limits of our calculators    what's that  Does yours go higher  Volunteer  I don't know. AB  Oh  yours does  Volunteer  I can probably do it. AB  I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile  let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number on the board here      . Would you each enter that on your calculator  And instead of squaring it this time  I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want  but don't tell me what you're multiplying by    just multiply it by any random three digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number. How many digits do you have  six or seven  Seven  and yours  Seven  Seven  And  uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have  Say  No.  Good  then I shall attempt the impossible    or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits  any six of them  in any order you'd like. One digit at a time  I shall try and determine the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer                  . AB  Did you leave out the number    Good  OK  that's one. You have a seven digit number  call out any six of them please. Volunteer               . I think I only heard five numbers. I    wait             did you leave out the number    Same as she did  OK. You've got a seven digit number    call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer                  . I think you left out the number    AB  That's three. The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in            to the fourth power. OK  any six of them. Really scramble them up this time  please. Volunteer                  . Did you leave out the number    And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. For my next number    while I mentally recharge my batteries  I have one more question for the audience. By any chance  does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on  If you think you know your birth day  raise your hand. Let's see  starting with    let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it  first of all  That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience      .       and the month  November what    rd    was that a Monday  Audience  Yes. Good. Somebody else  I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK  how about you  what year        and the month  October what  Fifth    was that a Wednesday  Yes  I'll go way to the back right now  how about you  Yell it out  what year  Audience      .       OK    and the month  Audience  February. February what  Sixth    was that a Friday  Audience  Yes. Good  how about the person behind her  Call out  what year was it  Audience      . AB        and the month  Audience  May. AB  May what  Seventh    would that be a Wednesday  Audience  Yes. AB  Thank you very much. Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born  We can do it that way. Of course  I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know  so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as       because you never know. I didn't mean to look at you  sir    you were just sitting there. Anyway  Chris  you can help me out here  if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day  What year was it  first of all  Audience      .       turn to the calendar with     . And what month  Audience  April. AB  April what  Audience    th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm  Chris  Chris Anderson  Yes. AB  I'll tell you what  Chris  as long as you have that book in front of you  do me a favor  turn to a year outside of the     s  either into the     s or way into the     s    that'll be a much greater challenge for me. AB  What year would you like  CA      . AB        OK. AB  And what month  CA  June. AB  June what  CA  Sixth. AB  Was that a Sunday  CA  It was. AB  And it was cloudy. Good  thank you very much. But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here who had a    digit calculator. Where is he  would you stand up     digit guy  OK  stand up for me just for a second  so I can see where you are. You have a    digit calculator  sir  as well  OK  what I'm going to try and do  is to square in my head a five digit number requiring a    digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting for you  as well as for me  I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud. So you can actually  honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size. Now  I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets  but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week  so    I think we're OK. So  let's see  let's take a different row of people  starting with you. I'll get five digits  one  two  three  four. Oh  I did this row already. Let's do the row before you  starting with you  one  two  three  four  five. Call out a single digit    that will be the five digit number that I will try to square  go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three.           squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem down into three parts. I'll do        squared  plus     squared  plus        times     times two. Add all those numbers together  and with any luck  arrive at the answer. Now  let me recap. Thank you. While I explain something else       I know  that you can use  right  While I do these calculations  you might hear certain words  as opposed to numbers  creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code  a mnemonic device that I use  that allows me to convert numbers into words. I store them as words  and later on retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated  it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of  Rain Man.  There's definitely a method to my madness    definitely  definitely. Sorry. If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards  you can talk to me then. By the way  one last instruction  for my judges with the calculators    you know who you are    there is at least a    percent chance that I will make a mistake here. If I do  don't tell me what the mistake is  just say   you're close   or something like that  and I'll try and figure out the answer    which could be pretty entertaining in itself. If  however  I am right  whatever you do  don't keep it to yourself  OK  Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right  because this is my big finish  OK. So  without any more stalling  here we go. I'll start the problem in the middle  with    times    .    times    is        plus     is       that's        plus             plus     is       .         double that to get       .        becomes cookie fission  cookie fission is       . That seems right  I'll go on. Cookie fission  OK. Next  I do    squared  which is        so I can say  three billion. Take the      add that to cookie       oops  but I see a carry coming           add that to cookie      plus     is     million    fission  fission  OK  finally  we do     squared  that's     times      plus    squared is          rev up if I need it  rev up  take the      add that to fission  to get  oh gee           . Audience  Yeah  AB  Good. Thank you very much. I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. You know  I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion  these very moving demonstrations we've just seen  HIV in Africa  President Clinton last night. And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking  if you will  about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal. I'm a psychologist  but rest assured  I will not bring it to the scrotal. There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help  we do sometimes  and we don't other times. A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic. Half of those students were given  as a topic  the parable of the Good Samaritan  the man who stopped the stranger in    to help the stranger in need by the side of the road. Half were given random Bible topics. Then one by one  they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon. As they went from the first building to the second  each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning  clearly in need. The question is  Did they stop to help  The more interesting question is  Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan  Answer  No  not at all. What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in    were they feeling they were late  or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about. And this is  I think  the predicament of our lives  that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction. There's a new field in brain science  social neuroscience. This studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact. And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help. That is to say  if we attend to the other person  we automatically empathize  we automatically feel with them. There are these newly identified neurons  mirror neurons  that act like a neuro Wi Fi  activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel  with  automatically. And if that person is in need  if that person is suffering  we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument. But then the question is  Why don't we  And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self absorption  to noticing  to empathy and to compassion. And the simple fact is  if we are focused on ourselves  if we're preoccupied  as we so often are throughout the day  we don't really fully notice the other. And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle. I was doing my taxes the other day  and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave  and I had an epiphany  it was    I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought  boy  my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva. Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit    that I felt good about myself. Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped  and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self focus to altruistic joy  to feeling good for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator. But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to. You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating. I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman  who was in the singles scene. And this woman says   My brother is having trouble getting dates  so he's trying speed dating.  I don't know if you know speed dating  Women sit at tables and men go from table to table  and there's a clock and a bell  and at five minutes  bingo  the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up. And this woman says   My brother's never gotten a card  and I know exactly why. The moment he sits down  he starts talking non stop about himself  he never asks about the woman.  And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times  looking at the back stories of marriages    because they're very interesting    and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said that when she was in the dating scene  she had a simple test she put people to. The test was  from the moment they got together  how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word  you  in it. And apparently Epstein aced the test  therefore the article. Now this is a    it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party. Here at TED there are great opportunities. The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called  The Human Moment   about how to make real contact with a person at work. And they said  well  the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry  close your laptop  end your daydream and pay full attention to the person. There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone  and all of a sudden we don't exist. The word is  pizzled   it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off. I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy  it's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths. I have a brother in law who's an expert on horror and terror    he wrote the Annotated Dracula  the Essential Frankenstein    he was trained as a Chaucer scholar  but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit. At any rate  at one point my brother in law  Leonard  decided to write a book about a serial killer. This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler. And before he was arrested  he had murdered his grandparents  his mother and five co eds at UC Santa Cruz. So my brother in law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying. For one thing  he's almost seven feet tall. But that's not the most terrifying thing about him. The scariest thing is that his IQ is      a certified genius. But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy  feeling with the other person. They're controlled by different parts of the brain. So at one point  my brother in law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to  and that is  how could you have done it  Didn't you feel any pity for your victims  These were very intimate murders    he strangled his victims. And the strangler says very matter of factly   Oh no. If I'd felt the distress  I could not have done it. I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off.  And I think that that is very troubling  and in a sense  I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off. When we focus on ourselves in any activity  we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person. Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism. Right now  as Bill McDonough has pointed out  the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences. We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot. We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats. Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient  it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill  In other words  we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use. In a sense  the room itself is the elephant in the room  but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this. There's a wonderful book called Stuff  The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects. And it talks about the back story of something like a t shirt. And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions  for instance  that cotton is very resistant to textile dye  about    percent washes off into wastewater. And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia. There's a company  Bennett and Company  that supplies Polo.com  Victoria's Secret    they  because of their CEO  who's aware of this  in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater. Right now  we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t shirt over the non virtuous one. So what would it take to do that  Well  I've been thinking. For one thing  there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store. You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it back to the factory  you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it  and if it's virtuous  you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous  you can go into    today  go into any store  put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode  which will take you to a website. They have it for people with allergies to peanuts. That website could tell you things about that object. In other words  at point of purchase  we might be able to make a compassionate choice. There's a saying in the world of information science  ultimately everybody will know everything. And the question is  will it make a difference  Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times  it was in the '  s  I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York    it was homeless people on the streets. And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me    what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where  when we see  when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision  it stays on the periphery. We don't notice and therefore we don't act. One day soon after that    it was a Friday    at the end of the day  I went down    I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs. And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side  shirtless  not moving  and people were just stepping over him    hundreds and hundreds of people. And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened  I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong. The moment I stopped  half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy. And we found out that he was Hispanic  he didn't speak any English  he had no money  he'd been wandering the streets for days  starving  and he'd fainted from hunger. Immediately someone went to get orange juice  someone brought a hotdog  someone brought a subway cop. This guy was back on his feet immediately. But all it took was that simple act of noticing  and so I'm optimistic. Thank you very much. So I thought   I will talk about death.  Seemed to be the passion today. Actually  it's not about death. It's inevitable  terrible  but really what I want to talk about is  I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about. So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died  saying   Hi  I'm Art Buchwald  and I just died.  And Mike  who I met at Galapagos  a trip which I won at TED  is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. In the last two years of his life  when he was sick  he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. He wrote about my strengths  weaknesses  and gentle suggestions for improvement  quoting specific incidents  and held a mirror to my life. After he died  I realized that no one writes to me anymore. Handwriting is a disappearing art. I'm all for email and thinking while typing  but why give up old habits for new  Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives  There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him  and trade all those years for one hug. But too late. But that's when I take out his letters and I read them  and the paper that touched his hand is in mine  and I feel connected to him. So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy  and not a financial one. A value for things with a personal touch    an autograph book  a soul searching letter. If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper    John  it'll be a recycled one    and write a beautiful letter to someone they love  we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. So what do I plan to leave for my son  I collect autograph books  and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them    and CDs too  Tracy. I plan to publish my own notebook. As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire  I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. I have no idea how I'm going to do it  but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book  and leave that published book for my son. I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. And those linguists  please pardon the grammar  because I've not looked at it in the last    years. I took it out for the first time to come here.  Picture in a frame  ashes in a bottle  boundless energy confined in the bottle  forcing me to deal with reality  forcing me to deal with being grown up. I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong  but right now  I am being sucked down  surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters  craving to cleanse my soul  trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time  to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair  holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity  to live again and to love again.  Thank you. Welcome to  Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do.  I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children  so    take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer scientist by trade  but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of. So we build a lot of things  and I do put power tools into the hands of second graders. So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School  they do come back bruised  scraped and bloody. You know  we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States  or for sale with an item in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of   . So where does this trend stop  When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object  every pokey bit in the world  then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp  or not made out of round plastic  they'll hurt themselves with it. So  as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller  we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them. And despite all of our best efforts and intentions  kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can  in whatever environment they can. So despite the provocative title  this presentation is really about safety  and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative  confident and in control of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called     Dangerous Things.  This is  Five Dangerous Things.  Thing number one  Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not  it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it. So  playing with fire. This is like one of the great things we ever discovered  fire. From playing with it  they learn some basic principles about fire  about intake  combustion  exhaust. These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good  controlled fire. And you can think of the open pit fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me  they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys. Number two  Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness  which I think is a terrible thing. Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know  it's a spatula  it's a pry bar  it's a screwdriver and it's a blade  yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures they give knives    like  as soon as they're toddlers  they have knives. These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was     and it left a lasting impression  to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple of very simple rules    always cut away from your body  keep the blade sharp  never force it    and these are things kids can understand and practice with. And yeah  they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself. But you know  they're young. They heal fast. Number three  Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things  and like muscles  if you don't use parts of your brain  they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them  any given muscle adds strength to the whole system  and that applies to your brain  too. So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes  which have to do with visual acuity   D understanding  and structural problem solving  so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill  so it's very good for that kind of whole body training. These kinds of target based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills  so those are great. Number  four   Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about to throw out an appliance  don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid  or send him to my school  and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are  puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart  and no matter how complex they are  they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually  they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability  that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people  and you can understand them. Number five  Two parter. Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own    in this case  digital media. It's a very simple exercise  Buy a song on iTunes  write it to a CD  then rip the CD to an MP   and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically  the RIAA could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson for kids to understand  that some of these laws get broken by accident  and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open  and taking them apart and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child  so this is the alternate    For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law  you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs  these big things in the outside world  that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object  and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don't often have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot  make sure there's nothing in it  and that it's on private property  and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. Let's see  I think that's it. That's number five and a half. OK. Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart. I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion. There's a Jewish saying that I love. What is truer than truth  Answer  The story. I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity. All stories interest me  and some haunt me until I end up writing them. Certain themes keep coming up  justice  loyalty  violence  death  political and social issues  freedom. I'm aware of the mystery around us  so I write about coincidences  premonitions  emotions  dreams  the power of nature  magic. In the last    years I have published a few books  but I have lived in anonymity until February of       when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy. That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's  and my grandchildren think that I'm cool. Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame. One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony  of the opening ceremony  called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag bearers. I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete. Actually  I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker. I was told that this was no laughing matter. This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag. Five women  representing five continents  and three Olympic gold medal winners. My first question was  naturally  what was I going to wear  A uniform  she said  and asked for my measurements. My measurements. I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak  looking like the Michelin Man. By the middle of February  I found myself in Turin  where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the    Olympic teams was in the street. Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games. They all deserved to win  but there's the element of luck. A speck of snow  an inch of ice  the force of the wind  can determine the result of a race or a game. However  what matters most    more than training or luck    is the heart. Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal. It is all about passion. The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics. Passion lives here. Isn't it always true  Heart is what drives us and determines our fate. That is what I need for my characters in my books  a passionate heart. I need mavericks  dissidents  adventurers  outsiders and rebels  who ask questions  bend the rules and take risks. People like all of you in this room. Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters. They only make good former spouses. In the green room of the stadium  I met the other flag bearers  three athletes  and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren. Also  two women with passionate hearts  Wangari Maathai  the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted    million trees. And by doing so  she has changed the soil  the weather  in some places in Africa  and of course the economic conditions in many villages. And Somaly Mam  a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution. When she was    years old  her grandfather sold her to a brothel. She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS. And of brothels where children are forced to receive five     clients per day  and if they rebel  they are tortured with electricity. In the green room I received my uniform. It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear  but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated. Not bad  really. I looked like a refrigerator. But so did most of the flag bearers  except Sophia Loren  the universal symbol of beauty and passion. Sophia is over    and she looks great. She's sexy  slim and tall  with a deep tan. Now  how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles  I don't know. When asked in a TV interview   How could she look so good   She replied   Posture. My back is always straight  and I don't make old people's noises.  So  there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth. No grunting  no coughing  no wheezing  no talking to yourselves  no farting. Well  she didn't say that exactly. At some point around midnight  we were summoned to the wings of the stadium  and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag  and the music started    by the way  the same music that starts here  the Aida March. Sophia Loren was right in front of me    she's a foot taller than I am  not counting the poofy hair. She walked elegantly  like a giraffe on the African savannah  holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind    on my tiptoes    holding the flag on my extended arm  so that my head was actually under the damn flag. All the cameras were  of course  on Sophia. That was fortunate for me  because in most press photos I appear too  although often between Sophia's legs. A place where most men would love to be. The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium. My husband is offended when I say this    although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes       so he shouldn't take it personally. I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes  because I don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells. I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics    passion. So here's a tale of passion. The year is       the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo. By the way     percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls. We can call this place in Congo a death camp  because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation. The protagonists of this story are a young woman  Rose Mapendo  and her children. She's pregnant and a widow. Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed. Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive  and a few months later  she gives birth to premature twins. Two tiny little boys. She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick  and ties it with her own hair. She names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor  and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them. When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter  she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go  even when they hold a gun to her head. Somehow  the family survives for    months  and then  by extraordinary luck  and the passionate heart of a young American man  Sasha Chanoff  who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane  Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix  Arizona  where they're now living and thriving. Mapendo  in Swahili  means great love. The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo. I don't make them up. There's no need for that. I look around and I see them everywhere. I have worked with women and for women all my life. I know them well. I was born in ancient times  at the end of the world  in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family. No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist    although the term had not reached Chile yet  so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me. I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom  and for questioning the patriarchy. But I was happy to pay it  because for every blow that I received  I was able to deliver two. Once  when my daughter Paula was in her twenties  she said to me that feminism was dated  that I should move on. We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated  Yes  for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today  but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage  prostitution  forced labor    they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed. They have no control over their bodies or their lives. They have no education and no freedom. They are raped  beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity. For most Western young women of today  being called a feminist is an insult. Feminism has never been sexy  but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting  and I have seldom suffered from lack of men. Feminism is not dead  by no means. It has evolved. If you don't like the term  change it  for Goddess' sake. Call it Aphrodite  or Venus  or bimbo  or whatever you want  the name doesn't matter  as long as we understand what it is about  and we support it. So here's another tale of passion  and this is a sad one. The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh. The year is     . Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three week vacation. She's prepared to clean teeth  but when she gets there  she finds out that there are no doctors  no dentists  and the clinic is just a hut full of flies. Outside  there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated. The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars. Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth. She's not licensed for that  she has never done it. She risks a lot and she's terrified. She doesn't even have the proper instruments  but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine. Jenny has a brave and passionate heart. She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation. At the end  the relieved patient kisses her hands. That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth. The next morning  when she comes again to the so called clinic  her first patient is waiting for her with her husband. The woman's face looks like a watermelon. It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes. The husband  furious  threatens to kill the American. Jenny is horrified at what she has done  but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation. The day before  her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him. Millions of women live like this today. They are the poorest of the poor. Although women do two thirds of the world's labor  they own less than one percent of the world's assets. They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all  and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence  and they are constantly threatened by exploitation  violence and abuse. It is a fact that giving women education  work  the ability to control their own income  inherit and own property  benefits the society. If a woman is empowered  her children and her family will be better off. If families prosper  the village prospers  and eventually so does the whole country. Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya. She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees. She gets the women to plant new trees and water them  drop by drop. In a matter of five or six years  they have a forest  the soil is enriched  and the village is saved. The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down. Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy. For every dollar given to a women's program     dollars are given to men's programs. Women are    percent of humankind. Empowering them will change everything    more than technology and design and entertainment. I can promise you that women working together    linked  informed and educated    can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet. In any war today  most of the casualties are civilians  mainly women and children. They are collateral damage. Men run the world  and look at the mess we have. What kind of world do we want  This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking. Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order  We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody  not only for the privileged. In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings at the UC Berkeley library. No museum or gallery in the United States  except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work  has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison. They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power  in the voluminous Botero style. I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart. What I fear most is power with impunity. I fear abuse of power  and the power to abuse. In our species  the alpha males define reality  and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules. The rules change all the time  but they always benefit them  and in this case  the trickle down effect  which does not work in economics  works perfectly. Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom. Women and children  especially the poor  are at the bottom. Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse    a woman or a child. I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender  income  race  and class. I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization. But for real change  we need feminine energy in the management of the world. We need a critical number of women in positions of power  and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men. I'm talking about men with young minds  of course. Old guys are hopeless  we have to wait for them to die off. Yes  I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs and legendary breasts. But given a choice  I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai  Somaly Mam  Jenny and Rose Mapendo. I want to make this world good. Not better  but to make it good. Why not  It is possible. Look around in this room    all this knowledge  energy  talent and technology. Let's get off our fannies  roll up our sleeves and get to work  passionately  in creating an almost perfect world. Thank you. We are going to talk today about the sequel of  Inconvenient Truth.  It's time again to talk about  Inconvenient Truth   a truth that everyone is concerned about  but nobody is willing to talk about. Somebody has to take the lead  and I decided to do it. If you are scared by global warming  wait until we learn about local warming. We will talk today about local warming. Important health message  blogging may be hazardous to your health  especially if you are a male. This message is given as a public service. Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture. This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging  this is the posture of ladies who are blogging. This is the natural posture of a man sitting  squatting for ventilation purposes. And this is the natural posture of a standing man  and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session. This is male blogging posture sitting  and the result is   For greater comfort  men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women  when working on laptop. However  they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps  which resulted in a significant rise of body heat between their thighs.  This is the issue of local warming. This is a very serious newspaper  it's Times of England    very serious. This is a very       gentlemen and ladies  be serious. This is a very serious research  that you should read the underline. And be careful  your genes are in danger. Will geeks become endangered species  The fact  population growth in countries with high laptop    I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph. Global warming fun. But let's keep things in proportion. How to take care in five easy steps  first of all  you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath. You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing. You should care about your posture    this is not right. Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me  because I have a video I have to show you. You are great. This is the correct posture. Another benefit of Wi Fi  we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi Fi. Wi Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced protection measures  which I would like to share with you  and I would like  in a minute  to thank Philips for helping. This is a research which was done in '    but it's still valid. Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature and is lowered by shaving. By the way  I must admit  my English is not so good  I didn't know what is scrotal  I understand it's a scrotum. I guess in plural it's scrotal  like medium and media. Digital scrotum  digital media. And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner. And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government  so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes. Video  Man  The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek  ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim those scruffy underarm hairs  the untidy curls on and around your  bleep   as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your  bleep  and  bleep . Once you use the Bodygroom  the world looks different. And so does your  bleep . These days  with a hair free back  well groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my  bleep   well  let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy. Yossi Vardi  This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year  known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips       for this gesture for humanity. And this is how they are promoting the product. This is    I didn't touch it  this is original. Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed  there are some secondary uses. And then our next talk  our next TED if you invite me will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket. And this is what the young generation says. And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching  but I also practice.   am in the morning. You cannot use this picture. Now  I have some mini TED Prizes  this is the Philips Bodygroom  one for our leader. Anybody feels threatened  anybody really need it  Any lady  any lady  Thank you very much. I study ants  and that's because I like to think about how organizations work. And in particular  how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization. So  ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that  and there are many others. The web is one. There are many biological systems like that    brains  cells  developing embryos. There are about        species of ants. They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens  and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers. And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control. Nobody tells anybody what to do. The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management. No ant directs the behavior of any other ant. And I try to figure out how that works. And I've been working for the past    years on a population of seed eating ants in southeastern Arizona. Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants  and the rabbit just happens to be there. And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds. This is the nest of the mature colony  and there's the nest entrance. And they forage maybe for about    meters away  gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest  and store them. And every year I go there and make a map of my study site. This is just a road. And it's not very big  it's about     meters on one side      on the other. And every colony has a name  which is a number  which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before  and figure out which ones have died  and put all the new ones on the map. And by doing this I know how old they all are. And because of that  I've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger. So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony. Ants never make more ants  colonies make more colonies. And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives    those are the ones with wings    on a mating flight. So every year  on the same day    and it's a mystery exactly how that happens    each colony sends out its virgin  unmated queens with wings  and the males  and they all fly to a common place. And they mate. And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings. And she's in the process of mating with this male  and there's another male on top waiting his turn. Often the queens mate more than once. And after that  the males all die. That's it for them. And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere  drop their wings  dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs. And they will live for    or    years  continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating. So the queen goes down in there. She lays eggs  she feeds the larvae    so an ant starts as an egg  then it's a larva. She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves. Then  as soon as the ants    the first group of ants    emerge  they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants. They go out  they get the food  they dig the nest  and the queen never comes out again. So this is a one year old colony    this happens to be    . There's the nest entrance  there's a pencil for scale. So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer. This is a three year old colony. There's the nest entrance  there's a pencil for scale. They make a midden  a pile of refuse    mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat. This is a five year old colony. This is the nest entrance  here's a pencil for scale. This is about as big as they get  about a meter across. And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes    so this is about        worker ants    changes as a function of colony age  in years. So it starts out with zero ants  just the founding queen  and it grows to a size of about    or    thousand ants when the colony is five. And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants  when she's about    or    years old. And it's when they reach this stable size  in numbers of ants  that they start to reproduce. That is  to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight. And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants.  Laughter  So that's not the most fun part of this research  although it's interesting. Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation. That's not just how is the colony organized  but how does it change what it's doing  How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change  So  things happen to an ant colony. When it rains in the summer  it floods in the desert. There's a lot of damage to the nest  and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess. When extra food becomes available    and this is what everybody knows about picnics    then extra ants are allocated to collect the food. So  with nobody telling anybody what to do  how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task  And that's the process that I call task allocation. And in harvester ants  I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories  where an ant is foraging  when it's out along the foraging trail  searching for food or bringing food back. The patrollers    that's supposed to be a magnifying glass    are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active. They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go  and by coming back    just by making it back    they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out. Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest  and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house. That is  that there are chambers inside  they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe like surface in it. It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area. And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest  and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles. So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand  put it down  turn around  and go back in. And finally  the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage. So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse. On one day  it'll all be here  and then the next day they'll move it over there  and then they'll move it back. So that's what the midden workers do. And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest. So that's only about    percent of the colony  and they're the oldest ants. So  an ant starts out somewhere near the queen. And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide  so about a meter deep for the big old nests. And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber  where we often find the queen  after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes. I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes  but instead because when there's flooding  occasionally the colony has to go down deep. So there's this whole network of chambers. The queen's in there somewhere  she just lays eggs. There's the larvae  and they consume most of the food. And this is true of most ants    that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating. They bring it back and feed it to the larvae. When the foragers come in with food  they just drop it into the upper chamber  and other ants come up from below  get the food  bring it back  husk the seeds  and pile them up. There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest. And curiously  and interestingly  it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing. So  despite what it says in the Bible  about  you know   Look to the ant  thou sluggard   in fact  you could think of those ants as reserves. That is to say  if something happened    and I've never seen anything like this happen  but I've only been looking for    years    if something happened  they might all come out if they were needed. But in fact  mostly they're just hanging around in there. And I think it's a very interesting question    what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing  And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside. And if you mark ants that are working outside  and dig up a colony  you never see them deep down. So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger. They somehow get into this reserve. And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce. And once they belong to the ants that work outside  they never go back down. Now ants    most ants  including these  don't see very well. They have eyes  they can distinguish between light and dark  but they mostly work by smell. So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true    you know  even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do  there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest. So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony. So when I first set out to work on task allocation  my first question was   What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks  Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing  Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing   And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others  knowing its place on the assembly line. And instead I wanted to ask   How are the different task groups interdependent   So I did experiments where I changed one thing. So for example  I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance  early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active. This is what it looks like about    minutes later. Here it is about    minutes later. And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there. And what I wanted to know was   OK  here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited    is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks   Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked. So here's some blue nest maintenance workers. And lately we've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three color system. And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which. We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers  and they work really well. And so just to summarize the result  well it turns out that yes  the different tasks are interdependent. So  if I change the numbers performing one task  it changes the numbers performing another. So for example  if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up  then I see fewer ants out foraging. And this was true for all the pair wise combinations of tasks. And the second result  which was surprising to a lot of people  was that ants actually switch tasks. The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life. So for example  if I put out extra food  everybody else    the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food  they become foragers. The nest maintenance workers become foragers. The patrollers become foragers. But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works. Like I just said  if there is more food to collect  the patrollers  the midden workers  the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage. If there's more patrolling to do    so I created a disturbance  so extra patrollers were needed    the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol. But if more nest maintenance work is needed    for example  if I put out a bunch of toothpicks    then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance  they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest. So foraging acts as a sink  and the ants inside the nest act as a source. And finally  it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not. So  for example  when there's extra nest maintenance work to do  it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that. But the foragers somehow decide not to come out. And here was the most intriguing result  the task allocation. This process changes with colony age  and it changes like this. When I do these experiments with older colonies    so ones that are five years or older    they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic. The worse things get  the more I hassle them  the more they act like undisturbed colonies. Whereas the young  small colonies    the two year old colonies of just       ants    are much more variable. And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year. It could be this year  or this year. So  the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony. It's not due to the experience of older  wiser ants. Instead  something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older. And the obvious thing that's changing is its size. So since I've had this result  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules    very simple  local  probably olfactory  chemical rules could an ant could be using  since no ant can assess the global situation    that would have the outcome that I see  these predictable dynamics  in who does what task. And it would change as the colony gets larger. And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact. So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae. They smell with their antennae. When one ant touches another  it's smelling it  and it can tell  for example  whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other  through grooming  with a layer of grease  which carries a colony specific odor. And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts  the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks  in deciding what to do. And so what the message is  is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another  but the pattern. The pattern itself is the message. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that. But first you might be wondering  how is it that an ant can tell  for example  I'm a forager. I expect to meet another forager every so often. But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers  I'm less likely to forage. So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker. And we've learned that  in this species    and I suspect in others as well    these hydrocarbons  this layer of grease on the outside of ants  is different as ants perform different tasks. And we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside  the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change  and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks. And they can use that task specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons    they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks. And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads  and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate. And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it  as they would to contact with real ants. So I want now to show you a bit of film    and this will start out  first of all  showing you the nest entrance. So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance. They've gone out to do different tasks  and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines  or influences  each ant's decision about whether to go out  and which task to perform. This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest. In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope. But the idea is that the ants are in there  and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it    a stream of contacts with other ants. And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out  and what it does when it comes back out. You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these. Each ant  then  as it comes back in  is contacting other ants. And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip  are contacting the ants coming in. So  what's interesting about this system is that it's messy. It's variable. It's noisy. And  in particular  in two ways. The first is that the experience of the ant    of each ant    can't be very predictable. Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside. And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting. So  we do a lot of simulation and modeling  and also experimental work  to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to  in the aggregate  produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies. Again  I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork. In fact  if you watch ants at all  you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it. So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts  perfection arises. But it works pretty well. Ants have been around for several hundred million years. They cover the earth  except for Antarctica. Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts  in the aggregate  produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants. And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns    this network of interaction patterns    to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies. So the one thing  though  that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size. The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony    and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule  like  I expect to meet another forager every three seconds.  But in a small colony  it's likely to meet fewer foragers  just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet. So this is the kind of rule that  as the colony develops and gets older and larger  will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one. Thank you. I wanna start today    here's my thing. Hold on. There I go. Hey. I wanna start today    talk about the structure of a polypeptide.  Laughter  I get a lot of people asking me  in terms of  Lost   you know   What the hell's that island   You know  it's usually followed by   No  seriously  what the hell is that island   Why so many mysteries  What is it about mystery that I seem to be drawn to  And I was thinking about this  what to talk about at TED. When I talked to the kind rep from TED  and I said   Listen  you know  what should I talk about   He said   Don't worry about it. Just be profound.  So thank you  if you're here. I was trying to think  what do I talk about  It's a good question. Why do I do so much stuff that involves mystery  And I started trying to figure it out. And I started thinking about why do I do any of what I do  and I started thinking about my grandfather. I loved my grandfather. Harry Kelvin was his name  my mother's father. He died in     . He was an amazing guy. And one of the reasons he was amazing  After World War II he began an electronics company. He started selling surplus parts  kits  to schools and stuff. So he had this incredible curiosity. As a kid I saw him come over to me with radios and telephones and all sorts of things. And he'd open them up  he'd unscrew them  and reveal the inner workings    which many of us  I'm sure  take for granted. But it's an amazing gift to give a kid. To open up this thing and show how it works and why it works and what it is. He was the ultimate deconstructer  in many ways. And my grandfather was a kind of guy who would not only take things apart  but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts  like  you know  printing  like the letter press. I'm obsessed with printing. I'm obsessed with silk screening and bookbinding and box making. When I was a kid  I was always  like  taking apart boxes and stuff. And last night in the hotel  I took apart the Kleenex box. I was just looking at it. And I'm telling you ...  Laughter  It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God. I mean  when you look at the box  and you sort of see how it works. Rives is here  and I met him years ago at a book fair  he does pop up books. And I'm obsessed with  like  engineering of paper. But like  the scoring of it  the printing of it  where the thing gets glued  you know  the registration marks for the ink. I just love boxes. My grandfather was sort of the guy who  you know  kind of got me into all sorts of these things. He would also supply me with tools. He was this amazing encourager    this patron  sort of  to make stuff. And he got me a Super   camera when I was    years old. And in       that was sort of an anomaly  to be a    year old kid that had access to a camera. And you know  he was so generous  I couldn't believe it. He wasn't doing it entirely without some manipulation. I mean  I would call him  and I'd be like   Listen  Grandpa  I really need this camera. You don't understand. This is  like  you know  I want to make movies. I'll get invited to TED one day. This is like       Laughter  And you know  and my grandmother was the greatest. Because she'd be like  you know    she'd get on the phone. She'd be like   Harry  it's better than the drugs. He should be doing      She was fantastic.  Laughter  So I found myself getting this stuff  thanks to her assist  and suddenly  you know  I had a synthesizer when I was    years old    this kind of stuff. And it let me make things  which  to me  was sort of the dream. He sort of humored my obsession to other things too  like magic. The thing is  we'd go to this magic store in New York City called Lou Tannen's Magic. It was this great magic store. It was a crappy little building in Midtown  but you'd be in the elevator  the elevator would open    there'd be this little  small magic store. You'd be in the magic store. And it was just  it was a magical place. So I got all these sort of magic tricks. Oh  here. I'll show you. This is the kind of thing. So it would be like  you know. Right  Which is good  but now I can't move. Now  I have to do this  the rest of the thing  like this. I'm like   Oh  wow. Look at my computer over there    Laughter  Anyway  so one of the things that I bought at the magic store was this  Tannen's Mystery Magic Box. The premise behind the mystery magic box was the following     dollars buys you    dollars worth of magic. Which is a savings.  Laughter  Now  I bought this decades ago and I'm not kidding. If you look at this  you'll see it's never been opened. But I've had this forever. Now  I was looking at this  it was in my office  as it always is  on the shelf  and I was thinking  why have I not opened this  And why have I kept it  Because I'm not a pack rat. I don't keep everything but for some reason I haven't opened this box. And I felt like there was a key to this  somehow  in talking about something at TED that I haven't discussed before  and bored people elsewhere. So I thought  maybe there's something with this. I started thinking about it. And there was this giant question mark. I love the design  for what it's worth  of this thing. And I started thinking  why haven't I opened it  And I realized that I haven't opened it because it represents something important    to me. It represents my grandfather. Am I allowed to cry at TED  Because    no  I'm not going to cry. But     Laughter     the thing is  that it represents infinite possibility. It represents hope. It represents potential. And what I love about this box  and what I realize I sort of do in whatever it is that I do  is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility  that sense of potential. And I realize that mystery is the catalyst for imagination. Now  it's not the most ground breaking idea  but when I started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge  I started getting interested in this. And so I started thinking about  Lost   and the stuff that we do  and I realized  oh my God  mystery boxes are everywhere in what I do  In how    in the creation of  Lost   Damon Lindelof and I  who created the show with me  we were basically tasked with creating this series that we had very little time to do. We had    and a half weeks to write it  cast it  crew it  shoot it  cut it  post it  turn in a two hour pilot. So it was not a lot of time. And that sense of possibility    what could this thing be  There was no time to develop it. I'm sure you're all familiar with those people who tell you what you can't do and what you should change. And there was no time for that  which is kind of amazing. And so we did this show  and for those of you who  you know  who haven't seen it  or don't know it  I can show you this one little clip from the pilot  just to show you some stuff that we did. Claire  Help  Please help me  Help me  Help me  Jack  Get him out of here  Get him away from the engine  Get him out of here  C  I'm having contractions  J  How many months pregnant are you  C  I'm only eight months. J  And how far apart are they coming  C  I don't know. I think it just happened. Man  Hey  Hey  Hey  get away from    JJA  Now     years ago  if we wanted to do that  we'd have to kill a stuntman. We'd actually     Laughter  it would be harder. It would take    Take   would be a bitch. So the amazing thing was  we were able to do this thing. And part of that was the amazing availability of technology  knowing we could do anything. I mean  we could never have done that. We might have been able to write it  we wouldn't have been able to depict it like we did. And so part of the amazing thing for me is in the creative process  technology is  like  mind blowingly inspiring to me. I realize that that blank page is a magic box  you know  It needs to be filled with something fantastic. I used to have the  Ordinary People  script that I'd flip through. The romance of the script was amazing to me  it would inspire me. I wanted to try and fill pages with the same kind of spirit and thought and emotion that that script did. You know  I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed. So the Apple computer    like those    the PowerBook    this computer  right  it challenges me. It basically says  what are you going to write worthy of me   Laughter  I guess I feel this    I'm compelled. And I often am like  you know  dude  today I'm out. I got nothing. You know   Laughter  So there's that. In terms of the content of it  you look at stories  you think  well  what are stories but mystery boxes  There's a fundamental question    in TV  the first act is called the teaser. It's literally the teaser. It's the big question. So you're drawn into it. Then of course  there's another question. And it goes on and on. Look at  Star Wars.  You got the droids  they meet the mysterious woman. Who's that  We don't know. Mystery box  You know  Then you meet Luke Skywalker. He gets the Droid  you see the holographic image. You learn  oh  it's a message  you know. She wants to  you know  find Obi Wan Kenobi. He's her only hope. But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi  Mystery box  So then you go and he meets Ben Kenobi. Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi. Holy shit  You know    so it keeps us    So there's this thing with mystery boxes that I started feeling compelled. Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination    the withholding of information. You know  doing that intentionally is much more engaging. Whether it's like the shark in  Jaws     if Spielberg's mechanical shark  Bruce  had worked  it would not be remotely as scary  you would have seen it too much. In  Alien   they never really showed the alien  terrifying  Even in a movie  like a romantic comedy   The Graduate   they're having that date  remember  And they're in the car  and it's loud  and so they put the top up. They're in there    you don't hear anything they're saying  You can't hear a word  But it's the most romantic date ever. And you love it because you don't hear it. So to me  there's that. And then  finally  there's this idea    stretching the sort of paradigm a little bit    but the idea of the mystery box. Meaning  what you think you're getting  then what you're really getting. And it's true in so many movies and stories. And when you look at  E.T.   for example     E.T.  is this  you know  unbelievable movie about what  It's about an alien who meets a kid  right  Well  it's not.  E.T.  is about divorce.  E.T.  is about a heartbroken  divorce crippled family  and ultimately  this kid who can't find his way.  Die Hard   right  Crazy  great  fun  action adventure movie in a building. It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce. He's showing up to L.A.  tail between his legs. There are great scenes    maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time  but pretty great scenes. There's a half an hour of investment in character before you get to the stuff that you're  you know  expecting. When you look at a movie like  Jaws   the scene that you expect    we have the screen  These are the kind of  you know  scenes that you remember and expect from  Jaws.  And she's being eaten  there's a shark. The thing about  Jaws  is  it's really about a guy who is sort of dealing with his place in the world    with his masculinity  with his family  how he's going to  you know  make it work in this new town. This is one of my favorite scenes ever  and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of when you think of  Jaws.  But it's an amazing scene. Father  C'mere. Give us a kiss. Son  Why  Father  'Cause I need it. JJA  C'mon.  Why  'Cause I need it   Best scene ever  right  Come on  So you think of  Jaws     so that's the kind of stuff that  like  you know  the investment of character  which is the stuff that really is inside the box  you know  It's why when people do sequels  or rip off movies  you know  of a genre  they're ripping off the wrong thing. You're not supposed to rip off the shark or the monster. You gotta rip off    you know  if you rip something off    rip off the character. Rip off the stuff that matters. I mean  look inside yourself and figure out what is inside you. Because ultimately  you know  the mystery box is all of us. So there's that. Then the distribution. What's a bigger mystery box than a movie theater  You know  You go to the theater  you're just so excited to see anything. The moment the lights go down is often the best part  you know  And you're full of that amazing    that feeling of excited anticipation. And often  the movie's  like  there and it's going  and then something happens and you go   Oh    and then something else  and you're   Mmm ...  Now  when it's a great movie  you're along for the ride 'cause you're willing to give yourself to it. So to me  whether it's that  whether it's a TV  an iPod  computer  cell phone    it's funny  I'm an    as I said  Apple fanatic    and one day  about a year or so ago  I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote  'cause I always do. And he came on  he was presenting the video iPod  and what was on the enormous iPod behind him   Lost   I had no idea  And I realized  holy shit  it'd come full circle. Like  the inspiration I get from the technology is now using the stuff that I do  inspired by it  to sell technology. I mean  it's nuts   Laughter  I was gonna show you a couple of other things I'm gonna skip through. I just want to show you one other thing that has nothing to do with anything. This is something online  I don't know if you've seen it before. Six years ago they did this. This is an online thing done by guys who had some visual effects experience. But the point was  that they were doing things that were using these mystery boxes that they had    everyone has now. What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid  everyone has access to now. You don't need to have my grandfather  though you wished you had. But I have to tell you    this is a guy doing stuff on a Quadra     computer    the resolution's a little bit low    using Infinity software they stopped making    years ago. He's doing stuff that looks as amazing as stuff I've seen released from Hollywood. The most incredible sort of mystery  I think  is now the question of what comes next. Because it is now democratized. So now  the creation of media is    it's everywhere. The stuff that I was lucky and begging for to get when I was a kid is now ubiquitous. And so  there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there. And when I think of the filmmakers who exist out there now who would have been silenced  you know    who have been silenced in the past    it's a very exciting thing. I used to say in classes and lectures and stuff  to someone who wants to write   Go  Write  Do your thing.  It's free  you know  you don't need permission to go write. But now I can say   Go make your movie   There's nothing stopping you from going out there and getting the technology. You can lease  rent  buy stuff off the shelf that is either as good  or just as good  as the stuff that's being used by the  you know  quote unquote  legit people.  No community is best served when only the elite have control. And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity to see what else is out there. When I did  Mission  Impossible III   we had amazing visual effects stuff. ILM did the effects  it was incredible. And sort of like my dream to be involved. And there are a couple of sequences in the movie  like these couple of moments I'll show you. There's that. Okay  obviously I have an obsession with big crazy explosions. So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you. And it's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up. He's drowsy. He's crazy    out of it. And the guy wakes up  and he shoves this gun in his nose and shoots this little capsule into his brain that he's going to use later to kill him  as bad guys do. Bad Guy  Good morning. JJA  OK  now. When we shot that scene  we were there doing it  the actor who had the gun  an English actor  Eddie Marsan    sweetheart  great guy    he kept taking the gun and putting it into Tom's nose  and it was hurting Tom's nose. And I learned this very early on in my career  Don't hurt Tom's nose.  Laughter  There are three things you don't want to do. Number two is  Don't hurt Tom's nose. So Eddie has this gun    and he's the greatest guy    he's this really sweet English guy. He's like   Sorry  I don't want to hurt you.  I'm like    you gotta    we have to make this look good. And I realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working just as it was. And I literally  like  thought back to what I would have done using the Super   camera that my grandfather got me sitting in that room  and I realized that hand didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's. It could be Tom's. And Tom would know just how hard to push the gun. He wouldn't hurt himself. So we took his hand and we painted it to look a little bit more like Eddie's. We put it in Eddie's sleeve  and so the hand that you see    I'll show you again  that's not Eddie's hand  that's Tom's. So Tom is playing two roles.  Laughter  And he didn't ask for any more money. So here  here. Watch it again. There he is. He's waking up. He's drowsy  been through a lot. Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.  Laughter  Anyway. So. Thanks. So you don't need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies. And the mystery box  in honor of my grandfather  stays closed. Thank you.  Applause  We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea  and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down  it's a perfectly positively pitch black world. And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn't describe  these blinking lights    a world of bioluminescence  like fireflies. Dr. Edith Widder    she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association    was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals  and that's what you're seeing here on the screen. That's all bioluminescence. Like I said  just like fireflies. There's a flying turkey under a tree. I'm a geologist by training. But I love that. And you see  some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten  some they use to attract prey  but all of it  from an artistic point of view  is just positively amazing. And a lot of what goes on inside    There's a fish with glowing eyes  pulsating eyes. Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize  these lovely patterns. And then this last one  one of my favorites  this pinwheel design. Just absolutely amazing  every single dive. That's the unknown world  and today we've only explored about   percent of what's out there in the ocean. Already we've found the world's highest mountains  the world's deepest valleys  underwater lakes  underwater waterfalls    a lot of that we shared with you from the stage. And in a place where we thought no life at all  we find more life  we think  and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest  which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all. There's still    percent  and either that    percent is empty or just full of surprises. But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing. Cephalopods    head foots. As a kid I knew them as calamari  mostly. This is an octopus. This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab  and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can  with their incredible eyes  sense their surroundings  look at light  look at patterns. Here's an octopus moving across the reef  finds a spot to settle down  curls up and then disappears into the background. Tough thing to do. In the next bit  we're going to see a couple squid. Now males  when they fight  if they're really aggressive  they turn white. And these two males are fighting. They do it by bouncing their butts together  which is an interesting concept. Now  here's a male on the left and a female on the right  and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder  gentler squid in him. Let's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration  white on the right  brown on the left. He takes a step back  he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body  and comes up on the other side    Bingo  Now  I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males  but I don't know. Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish. This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish. And there he is  his droopy little eyes up here. But they can do pretty amazing things  too. Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice  and watch his tentacles    he just pulls them in  makes them look just like algae. Disappears right into the background. Positively amazing. Here's two males fighting. Once again  they're smart enough  these cephalopods  they know not to hurt each other. But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin. That's an amazing thing. Here's an octopus. Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move  because predators can see them. This guy can make himself look like a rock  and  looking at his environment  can actually slide across the bottom  using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen. His motion blends right into the background    the moving rock trick. So  we're learning lots new from the shallow water. Still exploring the deep  but learning lots from the shallow water. There's a good reason why  the shallow water's full of predators    here's a barracuda    and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod  you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide. In the next scene  you're going to see a nice coral bottom. And you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage  use your skin to change color and texture. Here's some algae in the foreground    and an octopus. Ain't that amazing  Now  Roger spooked him  so he took off in a cloud of ink  and when he lands  the octopus says   Oh  I've been seen. The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get.  That big brown makes his eyespot very big. So  he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards. I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me. I thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse. Watch the skin color  watch the skin texture. Just an amazing animal  it can change color and texture to match the surroundings. Watch him blend right into this algae. One  two  three. And now he's gone  and so am I. Thank you very much. Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be. And in my idea  heaven is satisfied curiosity. I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down  like I was watching TV when I was a child  and my elbows up. And I can basically look everywhere I want  see every movie I've always wanted to see. And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you're reading  there's something really soothing and easy. Well  the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life  in a way  because I discovered ... it took me a while to understand it  but when I discovered around    years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people  I finally decided to really embrace this passion. And I basically live my life in sort of a trance  and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. Just to give you an example  this is the exhibition  Humble Masterpieces  as it was at MoMA in     . We were in Queens  we were building the big  big  big  big building in Midtown  so we were in the small  small  small boondocks. That was one of the funnest moments of my career. But it's not only that. The typeface    the typeface is Helvetica  it's its   th anniversary this year. And so I start thinking    Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together  trying to outdo Akzidenz Grotesk  and come up with a new sans serif typeface    and the movie starts playing in my head already. And of course  you can imagine  with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred. And I do hope  by the way  that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you. The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home  Instead of having a tray with two peas  I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum quality design collection on a tray. So  everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces  and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces. And when you do that  usually you get    percent porn and    percent real suggestions  and instead it was all    almost    all good suggestions. And a lot of nationalism came in. For instance  I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop  but they were very proud so every Spaniard said  la frego.  And Italians did the pizza. And I wanted to show you  also  the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good    they had moonshine  laundry detergents and liquid nails. And I keep it going  and I just got  also  this suggestion from Milan  it's our traffic divider  which we call  panettone   and it's painted  it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic. So  think of your own  send them on if you want to    they're always welcome. But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I've been thinking of for    years ever since I got to MoMA. I'm Italian. In Italy  design is normal. Different parts of the world have a knack for different things. I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay  and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere  but the contemporary art was terrible. In Italy  in Milan especially  contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place. But design    oh  my God. What you find at the store at the corner  without going to any kind of fancy store  is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated. It's just what you find at the store. And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art. I'm always amazed    three year olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries. But design  for some reason  is still misunderstood for decoration. It's really interesting  what many people think when I say the word  design  is they think of this kind of overdesigned    in this case  it's overdesigned on purpose  but    decoration  interior decoration. They think of somebody choosing fabrics. Design can be that  of course  but it can also be this. It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people  because  as you know  Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies. So  what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline  so that instead of being completely strangled  a teenager can also sip a Coke. They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important. And then they make a little tent for the baby. However cruel  however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design  and it is miles away from the fancy furniture  but still  it's part of my same field of passion. What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it's great to work there. You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions  and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors. I'm very well aware that    percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse  and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there. But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in       which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better. There have been many episodes  and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience  but in two instances  his great grandfather  grandfather    I'm always a little perplexed about the relation  exactly    Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions  one in       it was about organic furniture  and the second one in      was low cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture. And then there was good design for very low price. There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life. So  I started out in '   with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design. It was about a new phase  in my opinion  in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves. And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California  at that time  they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market. And at the same time  the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro  who did these beautiful salt and pepper containers that are made of rice dough. So you see  the range is really quite diverse. And then  for instance  this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in       where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time. And you see IDEO there. It was beautiful    it was called Personal Skies. The idea was that if you had a cubicle  you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own  Cielo in Una Stanza     a sky in a room    it's a very famous Italian song. And other examples  this was Marti Guixe about working on the go  and Hella Jongerius  my favorite  about how to work at home. And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design  designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world. What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs  current conditions in economy  in materials  in sustainability issues  and then what they do at the end    if they are good    is much more than the sum of its parts. Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious. The idea behind her work was that at that time  everybody was saying you have to really divide your life. Instead  she said   No  no. Work and leisure can be together.  Yeah  that's particularly gorgeous    it's the TV dinner of     . There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime  but I don't want to focus on my shows. I would like  instead  to talk about how great some designers are. I've always had a hard time with the word  maverick.  I came to the United States    years ago  and to this day I have to ask   What does that mean   So  this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle. Therefore  he was not following everybody's lead  and therefore  he was a maverick. So  designers do need to be mavericks  because the best way to design a successful object    and also an object that we were missing before    is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it. So  Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year. It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection. It's a long story because it started before      and it was called Emergency. And then when      happened  I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until  slowly but surely  it came back    as a half full glass instead of half empty    and it was about protection and safety. But it ranged from such items as a complete de mining equipment to these kind of water sterilizing straws  so it was really wide ranging. It also had ... you know  Cameron and I worked a little bit together  and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition. But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore  design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point. It's a sense of economy and a sense  also  of humor. This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland  who's South African. It's a suit for civil disobedience. The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you  you're wearing this thing    it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified    and the police is reminded  it's like having a flower in front of the rifle. And also  you can imagine  a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police. So  designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional  but they're functional to our understanding of issues. Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia  like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away  or even better  the huggable atomic mushroom  which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States    I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA  or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self  and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic. This is Cindy van den Bremen  who is a Dutch designer that's done this series of Capsters. They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski  play tennis  do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves. And sometimes by doing this kind of research  you encounter such beautiful ideas of design. Twan Verdonck is really young  I think he's     and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments. They're quite beautiful. They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you    because autistic children like to be hugged tight  so it has a spring inside    all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self. Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges. I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul. And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury  and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury  and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much. I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy    very  very clear limits. This is Cuba  and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell  and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks. So they're quite beautiful  but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical. And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo  Fernando and Humberto Campana  who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money. But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself. So really  design takes everything into account  and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances  as we become more and more wireless and impalpable  designers  instead  want us to be hands on. Sometimes hammer on. This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically. Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint  all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona. From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes. It's quite beautiful because somehow  this is a gorgeous moment for design. Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna  whose name was Marchetti  explain how the innovation in the military industry    therefore  secret innovation    and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed. And that makes sense. In moments of war there's great technological innovation  and in the world you have to do without    well  during the Second World War  you had to do without steel  you had to do without aluminum. And then as peace comes  all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market. Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance  fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden. I think that this is a strange moment. The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously  just like the rhythm of our life in the past    years  so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is. But it surely is a very important moment for design  because not only is the technology proceeding  not only is computing technology making open source possible also in the world of design  but also the idea of sustainability    which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO  emissions and footprint  but also sustainability of human interrelationships    is very much part of the work of so many designers. And that's why designers  more and more  are working on behaviors rather than on objects. Especially the good ones  not all of them. I wanted to show you  for instance  the work of Mathieu Lehanneur  which is quite fantastic. He's another young designer from France who's working    and at this point he's working  also  with pharmaceutical companies    on new ways to engage patients  especially children  in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty. For instance  this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine  so the child has to go    pffff     to release and relieve the container itself. And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin  so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery. Similarly  there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste  orally. The next show that I'm going to work on    and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here    is about the relationship between design and science. I'm trying to find not the metaphors  but  rather  the points in common    the common gripes  the common issues  the common preoccupations    and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction  as a direction rather than a prescription of form. And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this. I've sent an email already to quite a few of you. But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales  and therefore  really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful. Thank you.  Applause  Frank Gehry  I listened to this scientist this morning. Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments  and I realized that I almost became a scientist. When I was    my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water. So  I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator  and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in. And the glass    luckily I turned around    I had it all in my back and I was about    feet away. The wall was covered with ... I had an explosion. Richard Saul Wurman  Really  FG  People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay. RSW  ... huh.  Laughter  I'd like to start this session again. The gentleman to my left is the very famous  perhaps overly famous  Frank Gehry. And Frank  you've come to a place in your life  which is astonishing. I mean it is astonishing for an artist  for an architect  to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time. I mean you have become  whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny ... you know  it's a strange thought  but your building is an icon    you can draw a little picture of that building  it can be used in ads    and you've had not rock star status  but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life. And I know the road was extremely difficult. And it didn't seem  at least  that your sell outs  whatever they were  were very big. You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody. But that's an interesting thing for a creative person. A lot of us work for people  we're in the hands of other people. And that's one of the great dilemmas    we're in a creativity session    it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity  how to do work that's big enough and not sell out. And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big  triply big. It's not quite a question but you can comment on it. It's a big issue. FG  Well  I've always just ... I've never really gone out looking for work. I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head. And when I started out  I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff. And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff  and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. But I couldn't do anything else. That was my response to the people in the time. And actually  it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money  so they couldn't afford very much. I think it was circumstantial. Until I got to my house  where the client was my wife. We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like    grand I built a house around it. And a few people got excited about it. I was visiting with an artist  Michael Heizer  out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere. He's building this huge concrete place. And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink. We were standing out in the desert all alone and  thinking about my house  he said   Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent  somewhere in      years somebody's going to like it   So  I thought   Yeah  that's probably a good idea.  Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money  so the stuff was a little more permanent. But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long  this guy was telling us the other day. So where do we go now  Back to    everything's so temporary. I don't see it the way you characterized it. For me  every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity  almost like the first project I ever did  and I get the sweats  I go in and start working  I'm not sure where I'm going    if I knew where I was going  I wouldn't do it. When I can predict or plan it  I don't do it. I discard it. So I approach it with the same trepidation. Obviously  over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK. I do run a kind of a business    I've got     people and you've got to pay them  so there's a lot of responsibility involved    but the actual work on the project is with  I think  a healthy insecurity. And like the playwright said the other day    I could relate to him  you're not sure. When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it  I saw all the mistakes  I saw ... They weren't mistakes  I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it. I felt an embarrassment     How could I have done that  How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that   It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say    as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street  and it appears to have a relationship    that I started to like it. RSW  What's the status of the New York project  FG  I don't really know. Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me  and I thought he was nuts. I didn't think he knew what he was doing  and he pulled it off. So  I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy. He gets up there and then he ... comes back up. They're still talking about it. September    generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero  and I'm totally against that. I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time. RSW  The picture on the screen  is that Disney  FG  Yeah. RSW  How much further along is it than that  and when will that be finished  FG  That will be finished in         September  October    and I'm hoping Kyu  and Herbie  and Yo Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place. Luckily  today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like. Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me. He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time. There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients. If you think about the world  and even just in this audience  most of us are involved with buildings. Nothing that you would call architecture  right  And so to find one  a guy like that  you hang on to him. He's become the head of Art Center  and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there. I knew Craig and respected him. They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that    it's a beautiful  minimalist  black steel building    and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage. I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal  Alvaro Siza. RSW  Why did you want that  FG  I knew you'd ask that question. It was intuitive. Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture. I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work  and his early work had a resemblance to my early work. When I came out of college  I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California  and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that. I tried to understand that language as a beginning  as a place to jump off  and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ... I just stopped. I mean  Charlie Moore did a bunch of it  but it didn't feel good to me. Siza  on the other hand  continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language. And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building. I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out. I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you. I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra  who doesn't think architecture is art. Did you see that thing  RSW  No. What did he say  FG  He calls architecture  plumbing.  FG  Anyway  the Siza thing. It's a richer experience. It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians    it's similar to that I would imagine    where you ... huh  Audience  Liquid architecture. FG  Liquid architecture. Where you ... It's like jazz  you improvise  you work together  you play off each other  you make something  they make something. And I think for me  it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city. RSW  Is it going to be near the current campus  Or is it going to be down near ... FG  No  it's near the current campus. Anyway  he's that kind of patron. It's not his money  of course. RSW  What's his schedule on that  FG  I don't know. What's the schedule  Richard  Richard Koshalek   Unclear  starts from     . FG      . You can come to the opening. I'll invite you. No  but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos  right  Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment  and if you can figure out how to work off each other    if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other  you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect. Like the Rockefeller Center model  which is kind of from another era. RSW  I found the most remarkable thing. My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building  you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces. I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED. The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city. That was the surprise of going across the river  of going on the highway around it  of walking down the street and finding it. That was the real surprise of Bilbao. FG  But you know  Richard  most architects when they present their work    most of the people we know  you get up and you talk about your work  and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying   Look  I'm worried about the context  I'm worried about the city  I'm worried about my client  I worry about budget  that I'm on time.  Blah  blah  blah and all that stuff. And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... by saying all that  it means your work is good somehow. And I think everybody    I mean that should be a matter of fact  like gravity. You're not going to defy gravity. You've got to work with the building department. If you don't meet the budgets  you're not going to get much work. If it leaks    Bilbao did not leak. I was so proud. The MIT project    they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao. I met them in Bilbao. They came for three days. RSW  This is the computer building  FG  Yeah  the computer building. They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around    I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things  and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden  you know  People put buckets out ... I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place  it was just fantastic. But you've got to    yeah  well up until then every building leaked  so this ... RSW  Frank had a sort of ... FG  Ask Miriam  RW  ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while. FG  You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story  when the woman called and said   Mr. Wright  I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head.  And he said   Madam  move your chair.  So  some years later I was doing a building  a little house on the beach for Norton Simon  and his secretary  who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady  called me and said   Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head.  And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story. RSW  Didn't get a laugh. FG  No. Not now either. But my point is that ... and I call it the  then what   OK  you solved all the problems  you did all the stuff  you made nice  you loved your clients  you loved the city  you're a good guy  you're a good person ... and then what  What do you bring to it  And I think that's what I've always been interested in  is that    which is a personal kind of expression. Bilbao  I think  shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city. That's what reminded me of it. And I think that's the issue  you know  it's the  then what  that most clients who hire architects    most clients aren't hiring architects for that. They're hiring them to get it done  get it on budget  be polite  and they're missing out on the real value of an architect. RSW  At a certain point a number of years ago  people    when Michael Graves was a fashion  before teapots ... FG  I did a teapot and nobody bought it. RSW  Did it leak  FG  No. RSW  ... people wanted a Michael Graves building. Is that a curse  that people want a Bilbao building  FG  Yeah. Since Bilbao opened  which is now four  five years  both Krens and I have been called with at least     opportunities    China  Brazil  other parts of Spain    to come in and do the Bilbao effect. And I've met with some of these people. Usually I say no right away  but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings. In one case  I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city  and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port. I asked them what kind of building it was.  When you get here we'll explain it.  Blah  blah  blah. So four of us went. And they took us    they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay  and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor. Each one was more beautiful than the other. And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga. Just before going to lunch with the mayor  we went to the harbor commissioner. It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here  and I was here  and my guys. We sat down  and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet. And the guy looked at me and said   Now what can I do for you  Mr. Gehry   RSW  Oh  my God. FG  So  I got up. I said to my team   Let's get out of here.  We stood up  we walked out. They followed    the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said   You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor   I said   Nope.   You're not going to have dinner at all   They just brought us there to hustle this group  you know  to create a project. And we get a lot of that. Luckily  I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel. I don't have my own plane yet. RSW  Well  I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long. But let me just say a couple words. FG  Can I say something  Are you going to talk about me or you  RSW  Once a shit  always a shit  FG  Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody  so ... RSW  You're going to get one  You're going to get one  I'm going to make it for you  FG  No  no. Wait a minute  It's really quite an honor to be here tonight  and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are  literally  world premieres. I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology  which goes perfectly with this gathering. I started thinking about    when I was in college  especially as a blind person  doing a research paper was a major undertaking. You had to go to the library  see if you could get them to find the books for you  you know  footnotes and all that. Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. I wish I had that when I was in college. Anyway  this is a song about  we have all this  but what are we going to do with it  It's called  All the Answers.    What is the weather in Cincinnati      What is the time in Tokyo      Who is this little child's daddy      And who the hell needs to know      Why do memories of you linger     when I'm trying to reach my goal      And why must I move my fingers     to the music in my soul      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     'Cause here I go ...     and I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers     and I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     Think I'll rummage through the century     while I listen to the sea.     Oh  it's good to be so free      so free.     Who was mayor of Chicago     back in           And why did Shakespeare create Iago     to tear apart a love so pure      How can my dreams be so vivid     in a psychosonic way      Why must I become so livid     about the news I hear today      I don't know.     I don't have to know.     And here I go ...     'cause I got all the answers     right here in my hand.     And I got all the answers.     See  I don't have to understand     'cause I got all the answers.     I think I'll browse on through     the tabloid news     while I sip my tea.     Mm  it's good to be so free.     I never ever have to be alone.     I can do it all right here in my home.     Yeah  mm hmm ...     Everything that's ever been known      I can punch it up right here on my phone.     Freedom train  coming soon     right here in my living room     from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon     and all points in between.     'Cause I got all the answers     right here on my screen.     And I got all the answers  yeah.     I got every book and magazine.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers      all the answers  oh yeah.     Uh huh ...     But I tell you what I'm going to do      I'm going to find the capitol of Peru     or the latitude of Kathmandu.     I'm gonna Google it     'cause everybody's doing it.     And then I'll rummage through the century.     I got all  I got all  I got all ...     I got all the answers.     Yeah  yeah     I got all the answers.   Thank you. Whew  It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song. That's the first time I've ever played it. It's a  feel the fear and do it anyway  kind of thing. This next song is a song that started out as a dream    a childhood dream. It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record  except there's a couple of problems. One thing is  it's unpronounceable. And it's a made up word. It's called  Tembererana.  And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces. So  tembererana  was these dreams  in which I would be running away from bad feelings    is the only way I can put it. So this is called  Tembererana.  It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called  carnivalito.    A dream within a dream      a world within a world      the sound of a primal scream     travels out across the land.     Images flickering      the sound of the war machine      a procession of limousines     travels slowly across the land.     Another child could use a hand.     Reaching out from within     tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Annihilation moves.     The earth is an open tomb.     The sound of the final boom     rumbles fiercely across the land.     Fear  you're the enemy.     Obliterating all but thee.     You see what you want to see.     Before I'm blinded  I will toast     the shade of power that I love most      the power of creation.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     As a child  alone and afraid      escaping the impressions every feeling made      I would run  run away     into a world where the good was the aim of the game     and the sum of invisible power     had a name.     It's the same name.     Tembererana  hey  tembererana ...     Da  da  da  da  da  da  da     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana     Tembere  tembere  tembere  tembererana  hey     Tembererana  hey     Tembererana ...   It's a great honor to be here with you. The good news is I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar. And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech  but I have a box of slides. I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living. I've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words  and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes. The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania  in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead. And on a Wednesday afternoon  I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching  who made a great big old ceramic vessel  and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room    and if you've ever seen clay done  it's magic    and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life. So  I walked in the art room and I said   What is that   And he said   Ceramics. And who are you   And I said   I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that.  And he said   Well  get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here  and I'll teach it to you.  And so for the remaining two years of my high school  I cut all my classes. But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made  and they gave me passing grades. And that's how I got out of high school. And Mr. Ross said   You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience  so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me.  And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation. Well  I'm now a trustee of the university  and at my installation ceremony I said   I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation. Don't give up on the poor kids  because you never know what's going to happen to those children in life.  What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate. One is called Bidwell Training Center  it is a vocational school for ex steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers. You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh  Well  we don't make any steel anymore  and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it. And I rebuild them and give them new life. Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood. I was adopted by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots  and he donated a row house. And in that row house I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild  and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians  there's money in very close proximity. And the Bishop adopted me as his kid. And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life. I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright  the architect  and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh. And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport. And when you come to Pittsburgh    and you're all invited    you'll be flying into the blown up version of my building. That's the building. Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead. My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on  you have to look like the solution and not the problem. As you can see  it has a fountain in the courtyard. And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook  so I bought one and put it there. And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED  I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum. At a reception in their courtyard  I noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain. Well  I think that welfare mothers and at risk kids and ex steel workers deserve a fountain in their life. And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you    water is life and water of human possibility    and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech. So  from that fountain I built this building. As you can see  it has world class art  and it's all my taste because I raised all the money. I said to my boy   When you raise the money  we'll put your taste on the wall.  That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns  there's something beautiful looking back at you  that's deliberate. That's intentional. In my view  it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people. We also created a boardroom  and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto  Japan  and commissioned him to do    pieces of furniture for our building. We have since spun him off into his own business. He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people. And I got    pieces out of it for my school because I felt that welfare moms and ex steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day. Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech. We even have flowers in the hallway  and they're not plastic. Those are real and they're in my building every day. And now that I've given lots of speeches  we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me  and they said   Mr. Strickland  what an extraordinary story and what a great school. And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there.  I said   Well  I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there.  You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids. What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life. The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge. And so in my building  which is full of sunlight and full of flowers  we believe in hope and human possibilities. That happens to be at Christmas time. And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company    you've heard of them  They did all right in the ketchup business. And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz  who was our U.S. senator    who was tragically killed in a plane accident    he had heard about my desire to build a new building  because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site. And he called me into his office    which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz and John Heinz had     million dollars  and at the time I had about    cents. And he said   But we've heard about you. We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex steel workers  and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building. And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program.  Because back then  we were building a trades program. He said   That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company.  I said   Senator  I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about  but I promise you that if you'll support my school  I'll get it built and in a couple of years  I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire.  And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said   Well  what would your reaction be if I said I'd give you a million dollars   I said   Senator  it appears that we're going into the food training business.  And John Heinz did give me a million bucks. And most importantly  he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company. And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America  which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools  and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city. And we've never looked back. I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen. That happens to be our cafeteria line. That's puff pastry day. Why  Because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day. But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food. That good food's not for rich people    good food's for everybody on the planet  and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it. So at my school  we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs  but it's better for their heads. Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center. We have students who sit together  black kids and white kids  and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment  because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way. These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program. No sophistication  no class  no dignity  no history. What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money  which happens to be a curable condition. It's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior. That was done by a student after seven months in the program  done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef. I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good. They have no calories. That's our dining room. It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America. But this is my view of how students ought to be treated  particularly once they have been pushed aside. We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry  we train medical technicians for the medical industry  and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon. And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh    and you're all invited    you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators    months from enrolling in the program. There is absolutely no reason why poor people can't learn world class technology. What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music  and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time. We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry. We even teach people how to read. The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago    he's now an instructor. And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read. And so you must ask yourself the question  how is it possible in the   st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands  The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end  not the children who read. I can take these children and in    weeks  demonstrated aptitude  I can get them high school equivalent. No big deal. That's our library with more handcrafted furniture. And this is the arts program I started in     . Remember I'm the black kid from the '  s who got his life saved with ceramics. Well  I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood  the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm  you can bring them right back to life. I have     kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education. And these are children who are flunking out of public school. And last year I put    percent of those kids in college and I've averaged over    percent for    years. We've made a fascinating discovery  there's nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie's music can't cure. For that I won a big old plaque    Man of the Year in Education. I beat out all the Ph.D.'s because I figured that if you treat children like human beings  it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way. And why we can't institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me. Let me show you what these people do. We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging. And these are all kids with no artistic ability  no talent  no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists    Gordon Parks has been there  Chester Higgins has been there    and what we've learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them. In fact  I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican  an African American woman who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques  and let me show you what they did with the work. These were children who the whole world had given up on  who were flunking out of public school  and that's what they're capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence. We teach photography. And these are examples of some of the kids' work. That boy won a four year scholarship on the strength of that photograph. This is our gallery. We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery  so I designed this thing. We have smoked salmon at the art openings  we have a formal printed invitation  and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come. I couldn't buy a parent    years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time. He was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord. And I said   Bill  I want to hire you  man. You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit  but keep the enthusiasm. I can't get these parents to come to the school.  He said   I'll get them to come to the school.  So  he jumped in the van  he went to Miss Jones' house and said   Miss Jones  I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening but you probably didn't have a ride. So  I came to give you a ride.  And he got    parents and then    parents. At the last show that we did      parents showed up and we didn't pick up one parent. Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild because people think you're bad parents. And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents. Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated  every time  every town  every city. I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets. And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school  they've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it's all up here. You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior. And it's worked out pretty good up to this day. I even stuck another room on the building  which I'd like to show you. This is brand new. We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference. I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right. And the woman came out of the audience  she said   That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation. My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old.  And I said   Well  what do you do for a living   She said   Well  I work for a company called Hewlett Packard.  And I said   You're in the computer business  is that right   She said   Yes  sir.  And I said   Well  there's an easy solution to that problem.  Well  I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America. And that's the room that's initiating the relationship. We got it just done in time to show you  so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center. I only have a couple more slides  and this is where the story gets kind of interesting. So  I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here. In       I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it. And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here  Marty Ashby. And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon  and I said   Dizzy  why would you come to a black run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music   He said   Because I heard you built the center and I didn't believe that you did it  and I wanted to see for myself. And now that I have  I want to give you a gift.  I said   You're the gift.  He said   No  sir. You're the gift. And I'm going to allow you to record the concert and I'm going to give you the music  and if you ever choose to sell it  you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school.  And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later  but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing. And he showed up and said   Dizzy talking about you all over the country  man  and I want to help you.  And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up. Then a bass player named Ray Brown  and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine  and a piano player named Herbie Hancock  and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra  and a fellow named Tito Puente  and a guy named Gary Burton  and Shirley Horn  and Betty Carter  and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city. And I'm very pleased to tell you that  with their permission  I have now accumulated     recordings of the greatest artists in the world  including Joe Williams  who died  but not before his last recording was done at my school. And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said   God's picked you  man  to do this work. And I want my music to be with you.  And that worked out all right. When the Basie band came  the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music. And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy. And like a fool  I didn't go to the ceremony because I didn't think we were going to win. Well  we did win  and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden. Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back. So  we've become one of the hot  young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate. That's the place all filled up with Republicans. If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room  you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there. Including my mother and father  who lived long enough to see their kid build that building. And there's Dizzy  just like I told you. He was there. And he was there  Tito Puente. And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us. And that was our first recording studio  which was the broom closet. We put the mops in the hallway and re engineered the thing and that's where we recorded the first Grammy. And this is our new facility  which is all video technology. And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson  who recorded that album at our school last Christmas. And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day  he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpts from this album  the rights to which she donated to our school. And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell        CDs. We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts  right behind Tony Bennett. And I think we're going to be fine. This was burned out during the riots    this is next to my building    and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again. And that's the building  and that's the model  and on the right's a high tech greenhouse and in the middle's the medical technology building. And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done. It's also full of anchor tenants at    dollars a foot    triple that in the middle of the inner city. And there's the fountain. Every building has a fountain. And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants and they took half the building  and we now train medical technicians through all their system. And Mellon Bank's a tenant. And I love them because they pay the rent on time. And as a result of the association  I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus. And this is in the process of being built as we speak. Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city. And we're going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city. And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all     stores in six states. And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu  California  who are Hispanic. So  the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city. And I told my United States senator that there was a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this  we would become a left hand column in the Wall Street Journal  to which he readily agreed. And we got the funding and we open in the fall. And you ought to come and see it    it's going to be a hell of a story. And this is what I want to do when I grow up. The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake. I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park    which is less than       feet from the riverfront    for four million dollars and I didn't do it. And I built the first building  and guess what happened  I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year  and said   Mr. Strickland  you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award because you've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations. Thank you very much for that.  The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams  just in case they do come true. And finally  there's this picture. This is in a place called San Francisco. And the reason this picture's in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit  and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me. He said   Man  that's a great story. I want one of those.  I said   Well  I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living   He says   I run the city of San Francisco. My name's Willie Brown.  And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind. And that weekend  I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night    first time I'd met him. And he walked in and he says   What is this   And I said   Herbie  this is my concept of a training center for poor people.  And he said   As God as my witness  I've had a center like this in my mind for    years and you've built it. And now I really want to build one.  I said   Well  where would you build this thing   He said   San Francisco.  I said   Any chance you know Willie Brown   As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown  and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago  and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth. And Willie Brown said   As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco  I'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city.  And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board  and our friends from HP  and our friends from Steelcase  and our friends from Cisco  and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech. And along the way  I met this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley. He came up to me afterwards  he said   Man  that's a fabulous story. I want to help you.  And I said   Well  thank you very much for that. What do you do for a living   He said   Well  I built a company called eBay.  I said   Well  that's very nice. Thanks very much  and give me your card and sometime we'll talk.  I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano  but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center. I said   Hey man  what is eBay   He said   Well  that's the electronic commerce network.  I said   Well  I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card.  So  I called him up on the phone and I said   Mr. Skoll  I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and I'd like to become your friend.  And Jeff and I did become friends  and he's organized a team of people and we're going to build this center. And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview Hunters Point  and I said   The mayor sent me down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you  but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it. And all I've got is a box of slides.  And so I stood up in front of     very angry  very disappointed people on a summer night  and the air conditioner had broken and it was     degrees outside  and I started showing these pictures. And after about    pictures they all settled down. And I ran the story and I said   What do you think   And in the back of the room  a woman stood up and she said   In    years of living in this God forsaken place  you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity. I'm going with you  man.  And she turned that audience around on a pin. And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing  and we're going to build it all right. And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way and I showed him the box of slides. And Quincy said   I want to help you  man. Let's do one in L.A.  And so he's assembled a group of people. And I've fallen in love with him  as I have with Herbie and with his music. And Quincy said   Where did the idea for centers like this come from   And I said   It came from your music  man. Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums when I was    years old in the pottery class  when the world was all dark  and your music got me to the sunlight.  And I said   If I can follow that music  I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK. And if that's not true  how did I get here   I want you all to know that I think the world is a place that's worth living. I believe in you. I believe in your hopes and your dreams  I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm. And I'm tired of living like this  going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be  their spirits damaged. We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around. In Pennsylvania it costs        dollars to keep people in jail  most of whom look like me. It's        dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School. It's        dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail. Do the math    it will never work. I am banking on you and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something. And I want to do this in my lifetime  in every city and in every town. And I don't think I'm crazy. I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons. And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope. In my business it's very difficult work. You're always fighting upstream like a salmon    never enough money  too much need    and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work. And so I've figured out  over time  the solution to the depression  you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely. And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight. And thanks for listening to what I had to say.  J  napot  pac k  Which  as somebody here must surely know  means  What's up  guys   in Magyar  that peculiar non Indo European language spoken by Hungarians for which  given the fact that cognitive diversity is at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet  few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago. But there it is   J  napot  pac k  I said somebody here must surely know  because despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with  and the further fact that  so far as I know  there's not a drop of Hungarian blood in my veins  at every critical juncture of my life there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me. I even have dreams that take place in landscapes I recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films  especially the early movies of Miklos Jancso. So  how do I explain this mysterious affinity  Maybe it's because my native state of South Carolina  which is not much smaller than present day Hungary  once imagined a future for itself as an independent country. And as a consequence of that presumption  my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army  an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village throughout its long and troubled history. Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '  s  my uncle Henry    having denounced the Ku Klux Klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard  living under death threat    took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone. That was a very Hungarian thing to do  as anyone will attest who remembers     . And of course  from time to time Hungarians have invented their own equivalent of the Klan. Well  it seems to me that this Hungarian presence in my life is difficult to account for  but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration for people with a complex moral awareness  with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado. It's not a typical mindset for most Americans  but it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians. So   J  napot  pac k   I went back to South Carolina after some    years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the     s  with the reckless condescension of that era thinking I would save my people. Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving. I labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina  a Methodist affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College. I knew nothing about Wofford and even less about Methodism  but I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College to find  among the auditors in my classroom  a    year old Hungarian  surrounded by a bevy of middle aged European women who seemed to function as an entourage of Rhinemaidens. His name was Sandor Teszler. He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away. In appearance  he resembled Mahatma Gandhi  minus the loincloth  plus orthopedic boots. He had been born in      in the provinces of the old Austro Hungarian Empire  in what later would become Yugoslavia. He was ostracized as a child  not because he was a Jew    his parents weren't very religious anyhow    but because he had been born with two club feet  a condition which  in those days  required institutionalization and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and   . He went to the commercial business high school as a young man in Budapest  and there he was as smart as he was modest and he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation when he went into textile engineering  the success continued. He built one plant after another. He married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy. Once  as he had left instructions to have done  he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants. The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks    it was a hosiery mill  and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock and was shoveling in mountains of socks. Mr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said   But why do you steal from me  If you need money you have only to ask.  The night watchman  seeing how things were going and waxing indignant  said   Well  we're going to call the police  aren't we   But Mr. Teszler answered   No  that will not be necessary. He will not steal from us again.  Well  maybe he was too trusting  because he stayed where he was long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest. He took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family. And then one day  it happened  he and his family were arrested and they were taken to a death house on the Danube. In those early days of the Final Solution  it was handcrafted brutality  people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river. But none who entered that death house had ever come out alive. And in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film    the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill. It was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality  one of Mr. Teszler's sons  Andrew  looked up and said   Is it time to take the capsule now  Papa   And the Gauleiter  who afterwards vanishes from this story  leaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear   No  do not take the capsule. Help is on the way.  And then resumed the beating. But help was on the way  and shortly afterwards a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy. They were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers for the duration of the War  surviving burnings and bombings and  at the end of the War  arrest by the Soviets. Probably  Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain  then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South. Which  as chance would have it  was Spartanburg  South Carolina  the location of Wofford College. And there  Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success  especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double knit. And then in the late     s  in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education  when the Klan was resurgent all over the South  Mr. Teszler said   I have heard this talk before.  And he called his top assistant to him and asked   Where would you say  in this region  racism is most virulent    Well  I don't rightly know  Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain.   Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there.  The man did as he was told  and shortly afterwards  Mr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain. Now  you should know that at that time  the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated. The white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said   Mr. Teszler  I trust you re going to be hiring a lot of white workers.  Mr. Teszler told him   You bring me the best workers that you can find  and if they are good enough  I will hire them.  He also received a visit from the leader of the black community  a minister  who said   Mr. Teszler  I sure hope you're going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours.  He got the same answer   You bring the best workers that you can find  and if they are good enough  I will hire them.  As it happens  the black minister did his job better than the white mayor  but that's neither here or there. Mr. Teszler hired    men  eight white  eight black. They were to be his seed group  his future foremen. He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain  and for two months these    men would live and work together  mastering the new process. He gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions. There was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet  and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said   Well  yeah. We ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep  there's only one place to eat  there's only one bathroom  there's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what   Mr. Teszler said   You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions    No  I reckon I don't.  And two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers  white and black  poured in to see the facility for the first time  they were met by the    foremen  white and black  standing shoulder to shoulder. They toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions  and inevitably the same question arose   Is this plant integrated or what   And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said   You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers in this industry in this region and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions   And there were none. In one fell swoop  Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South. It was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi  conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint. In his eighties  Mr. Teszler  having retired from the textile industry  adopted Wofford College  auditing courses every semester  and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved  becoming affectionately known as  Opi     which is Magyar for grandfather    by all and sundry. Before I got there  the library of the college had been named for Mr. Teszler  and after I arrived in       the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College    partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog  but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us. To me  it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina was a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe. Wise he was  indeed  but he also had a wonderful sense of humor. And once for an interdisciplinary class  I was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's  The Seventh Seal.  As the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden  only to find the specter of death waiting for him  Mr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace  I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice   Uh oh   he said   This doesn't look so good.   Laughter  But it was music that was his greatest passion  especially opera. And on the first occasion that I visited his house  he gave me honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to. And I delighted him by rejecting  Cavalleria Rusticana  in favor of Bela Bartok's  Bluebeard's Castle.  I love Bartok's music  as did Mr. Teszler  and he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued. And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville  North Carolina in the last year of the composer's life. He was dying of leukemia and he knew it  and he dedicated this concerto to his wife  Dita  who was herself a concert pianist. And into the slow  second movement  marked  adagio religioso   he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring  he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part. And clearly this composition is his final statement to her    it was first performed after his death    and through her to the world. And just as clearly  it is saying   It's okay. It was all so beautiful. Whenever you hear this  I will be there.  It was only after Mr. Teszler's death that I learned that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale  New York was paid for by Sandor Teszler.  J  napot  Bela   Not long before Mr. Teszler s own death at the age of     he heard me hold forth on human iniquity. I delivered a lecture in which I described history as  on the whole  a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality  and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said   You know  Doctor  human beings are fundamentally good.  And I made a vow to myself  then and there  that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise had reached that conclusion  I would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow. And now he's dead  so I'm stuck with my vow.  J  napot  Sandor   I thought my skein of Hungarian mentors had come to an end  but almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek  a Hungarian doctor    actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte  North Carolina  then in his late seventies    who had been a pioneer in open heart surgery  and  tinkering away in his garage behind his house  had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures. He's also a prodigious art collector  beginning as an intern in Budapest by collecting   th  and   th century Dutch art and Hungarian painting  and when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art  Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics. He's the author of seven books  six of them on Mayan ceramics. It was he who broke the Mayan codex  enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script. On the occasion of my first visit  we toured his house and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality  and then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said  with obvious pride   Now for the piece De resistance.  And he opened the door and we walked into a windowless    by    foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling  and crammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics. Now  I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics  but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said   But Dr. Robicsek  this is absolutely dazzling.   Yes   he said.  That is what the Louvre said. They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece  but it was not a good one.   Laughter  Well  it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on    what else     Leonardo da Vinci. And further  I should invite him to meet my oldest trustee  who had majored in French history at Yale some    odd years before and  at     still ruled the world's largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand. His name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed  and Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success. And afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek on one hand  Mr. Milliken on the other. And it was only at that moment  as we were sitting down to dinner  that I recognized the enormity of the risk I had created  because to bring these two titans  these two masters of the universe together    it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo. If they didn't like each other  we could all get trampled to death. But they did  they did like each other. They got along famously until the very end of the meal  and then they got into a furious argument. And what they were arguing about was this  whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.  Laughter  Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed. I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans  these masters of the universe  in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies  when Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying   You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book.  And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair  but quickly gathered his wits  leaned forward and said   Well  that is true  but I'll bet you went to the movie with a grandchild.   Well  yes  I did   conceded Mr. Milliken.  Aha   said Dr. Robicsek.  I went to the movie all by myself.   Laughter   Applause  And I realized  in this moment of revelation  that what these two men were revealing was the secret of their extraordinary success  each in his own right. And it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity  that irrepressible desire to know  no matter what the subject  no matter what the cost  even at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock are willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around to imagine anything in the year       a scant    years from now.  Live each day as if it is your last   said Mahatma Gandhi.  Learn as if you'll live forever.  This is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this. It is this inextinguishable  undaunted appetite for learning and experience  no matter how risible  no matter how esoteric  no matter how seditious it might seem. This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians    Robicsek  Teszler and Bartok    as it does my own. As it does  I suspect  that of everybody here. To which I need only add   Ez a mi munkank  es nem is keves.  This is our task  we know it will be hard.  Ez a mi munkank  es nem is keves.

I show a number of photographs and films  but I also make television programs  books and some advertising  all with the same concept. And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture  and the importance of the image  celebrity is born of photography. I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago  when Princess Diana died. There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death  and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way. I was fascinated by this phenomenon  so I wondered  could one erase the image of Diana  actually quite crudely and physically  So  I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana  but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche. Momentum was being built. The press wrote about her death in rather  I felt  pornographic ways    like   Which bit of artery left which bit of body   and  How did she die in the back of the car      and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism  so I made these rather gory images. I then went on wondering whether I could actually replace her image  so I got a look alike of Diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in  or existed in  the public imagination. So people were wondering  was she going to marry Dodi  Was she in love with him  Was she pregnant  Did she want his baby  Was she pregnant when she died  So I created this image of Diana  Dodi and their imaginary mixed race child and this image came out  which caused a huge public outcry at the time. I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery  so I started making reference to media imagery    made it grainy  shot through doorways and so on and so forth    to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism. So  this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband  and this was a sequence of images. And this gets shown in art galleries like this  as a sequence. And similarly with the Di Dodian baby imagery    this is another art gallery installation. I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception. This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs  for instance  but you think it's Camilla and the Queen  and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real. And the camera can lie  and it makes it very  very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths. So  I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter. And at the same time  it removes us from the real subject matter  and this acts as a sort of titillating thing. So  the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism  what you can't have  you want more. In the photograph  the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more. And that is the way  I think  that celebrity magazines work now  the more pictures you see of these celebrities  the more you feel you know them  but you don't know them and you want to know them further. Of course  the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ... watch her horses.  Laughter . And then I was sort of making imagery. In England there's an expression   you can't imagine the Queen on the loo.  So I'm trying to penetrate that. Well  here is the image. All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this  giving full pages about how terrible this was. Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle  I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media    because we don't know the real people  very few of us know the real people    but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing  effectively  my filthy work. So  these are broadsheets  tabloids  debates were being had all about this work  films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work  politicians were getting involved    all sorts of things    great headlines. Then suddenly  it started to get on front pages. I was being asked and paid to do front covers. Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable  which I found also fascinating. How one moment    it was disgusting    journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me  saying my work was wonderful  and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me. But then this changed suddenly. I then started to work for magazines and newspapers. This was  for example  an image that went into Tatler. This was another newspaper image. It was an April fool actually  and to this day some people think it's real. I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day  and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill. They thought it was real. I was exploring  at the time  the hyperbole of icons    and Diana and Marilyn    and the importance of celebrity in our lives. How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing  and how that should happen. I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself. There's me as Diana    I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley  I think  in this one.  Laughter . And me as the Queen. I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn    the biggest icon of all    and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth  and only showing certain angles to create a reality that  obviously  is completely constructed. This is the look alike  so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous. She looks nothing like Marilyn  but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on  she looks exactly like Marilyn  to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her    or recognize this look alike    in these photographs  which I find quite interesting. So  all this work is getting shown in art galleries. Then I made a book. I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time. Stills from the TV series went into this book. But there was a real legal problem because it looks real  but how do you get over that  Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now  that we can't tell what's real. How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not  So  from my point of view  it's important to publish it  but at the same time it does cause a confusion    intentional on my behalf  but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with. So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do  and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures. You know  what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru  And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden  Saddam Hussein  the links that were put about pre Iraq war. And what is going to happen to the monarchy  Because obviously the British public  I think  would prefer William to Charles on the throne. And it's that wish  or that desire  that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work. I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves. I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity. And with some look alikes  they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not. I did an advertising campaign for Schweppes  which is Coca Cola  and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities. It's highly commercial. But it was a difficulty for me    because this is my artwork  should I do advertising     at the time. So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same. But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on  you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing. When you take the logo off  you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive  opposed to conclusive when you are advertising. This image is quite interesting  actually  because I think we made it three years ago. And it's Camilla in her wedding dress  which  again  nearly got re used now  recently prior to her wedding. Tony Blair and Cherie. And again  the legalities    we had to be very careful. It's obviously a very big commercial company  and so this little   Shh    it's not really them   was put on the side of the imagery. And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail. I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them  so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes    live scenes with look alikes inside the windows  and the windows were all steamed up. So  it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech  I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin  Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson  who he was having an affair with at that time. This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper  broadsheets and tabloids. It was a bit of a road stopper  which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds  but huge fun    it was great for me to do a performance. Also  people were taking photographs of this  so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly  all this imagery. And the press were interviewing  and I was signing my book.  Laughter . Further imagery. I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market    my previous book was only for the U.K. market    that I suppose it could be called humorous. I suppose I come from a sort of non humorous background with serious intent  and then suddenly my work is funny. And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous  in a way  I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery. It's an extremely fast way of getting information. It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly  and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery. This image  for example  is sort of spot on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private  and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein  and George Bush reading the Koran upside down. For example  George Bush target practice    shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore. And then you change the photograph he's shooting at  and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible.  Laughter . Tony Blair being used as a mounting block  and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind  and the seriousness  or the intellect  of Bush. And also  commenting on the behind the scenes    well  as we know now    what goes on in prisons. And in fact  George Bush and Tony Blair are having great fun during all of this. And really commenting  you know  based on the perception we have of the celebrities. What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life  and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf clubbed a driver the other day. I mean  it's extremely difficult to find these look alikes  so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films. And sometimes asking the real celebrity  mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person  which is highly embarrassing.  Laughter . I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis    a page a week in their newspaper    which has been very interesting  working topically. So  Jamie Oliver and school dinners  Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture  the whole of the hunting issue  and the royal family refusing to stop hunting  and the tsunami issues  and obviously Harry  Blair's views on Gordon Brown  which I find very interesting  Condi and Bush. This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it. I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change  and there were a terrible thing that has happened  but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that. That's why this image was made one year ago  and what it means today. So  I'll leave you with these clips to have a look.  Music  Chris Anderson  Thank you. This is your conference  and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now  in this transition period  about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit. So  I'm just going to grab a chair here. Two years ago at TED  I think    I've come to this conclusion    I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion. I think that I may have believed unconsciously  then  that I was kind of a business hero. I had this company that I'd spent    years building. It's called Future  it was a magazine publishing company. It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars  a number I didn't really understand. A magazine I'd recently launched called Business  .  was fatter than a telephone directory  busy pumping hot air into the bubble. And I was the    percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more. And all this had come from nothing. Fifteen years earlier  I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said   I really would like to start my own computer magazine.  And    years later  there are     of them and       people on staff and it was just such heady times. The date was February     . I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law    ever upward and to the right    it was going to go on forever. I mean  it had to. Right  I was in for quite a surprise. The dotcom  ironically called Snowball  was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded  and I entered    months of business hell. I watched everything that I'd built crumbling  and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and    years work would have come for nothing. And it was gut wrenching. It took eight years of blood  sweat and tears to reach     employees  something which I was very proud of in the business. February         in one day we laid off     people  and before the bloodshed was finished        people had lost their jobs from my companies. I felt sick. I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day  every day  for    months. And worse than that  far worse than that  my sense of self worth was kind of evaporating. I was going around with this big sign on my forehead   LOSER.  And I think what disgusts me more than anything  looking back  is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing  Well  in the end  we were able to save Future and Snowball  but I was  at that point  ready to move on. And to cut a long story short  here's where I came to. And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe  from many conversations  that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster    emotional rollercoaster    in the last couple years. This has been a big  big transition time  and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next. The theme next year is re birth. It was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED. And at about the same time  and I think partly because of that  I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus  I started to read again. And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games  there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest  cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology to ... all this stuff had changed. And the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much  and it was incredibly exciting. And what was really most exciting    and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least    years before I did    was that all this stuff is connected. It's connected  it all hooks into each other. We talk about this a lot  and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So  just one example  Madame de Gaulle  the wife of the French president  was famously asked once   What do you most desire   And she answered   A penis.  And when you think about it  it's very true  what we all most desire is a penis    or  happiness  as we say in English. And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room. But something as basic as happiness  which    years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue  today it turns out that there's dozens of TED like questions that you can ask about it  which are really interesting. You can ask about what causes it biochemically  neuroscience  serotonin  all that stuff. You can ask what are the psychological causes of it  nature  Nurture  Current circumstance  Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing. You can view it as a computing problem  an artificial intelligence problem  do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly  You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say  why is it that a billion people on this planet are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness  and whereas almost all the rest of them  regardless of how much money they have    whether it's two dollars a day or whatever    are almost equally happy on average  Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing  did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways  The ant's brain  parasitized  to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate  Are we the victims of a mass delusion  And so on  and so on. To understand even something as important to us as happiness  you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions  and there's nowhere that I've discovered    other than TED    where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions. And so  it's the profound thing that Richard talks about  to understand anything  you just need to understand the little bits  a little bit about everything that surrounds it. And so  gradually over these three days  you start off kind of trying to figure out   Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff   And at the end of the four days  your brain is humming and you feel energized  alive and excited  and it's because all these different bits have been put together. It's the total brain experience  we're going to ... it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage. Every mental organ addressed. It really is. Enough of the theory  Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do  all right  So  I will. Here's the vision for TED. Number one  do nothing. This thing ain't broke  so I ain't gonna fix it. Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me   Chris  TED is a really great conference. You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad.  So  I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason  and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with. Truth  curiosity  diversity  no selling  no corporate bullshit  no bandwagoning  no platforms. Just the pursuit of interest  wherever it lies  across all the disciplines that are represented here. That's not going to be changed at all. Number two  I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year. The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines. There's a year to do this  and already    I hope to show you a bit later    there's    or so terrific speakers signed up for next year. And I'm getting fantastic help from the community  this is just such a great community. And combined  our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country  if not the planet. It's true. Number three  I do want to  if I can  find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit. And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club. Books kind of saved me in the last couple years  and that's a gift that I would like to pass on. So  when you sign up for TED      every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED. They may well be by a TED speaker  and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual  emotional journey. I think it will be great. And then  fourthly  I want to mention the Sapling Foundation  which is the new owner of TED. What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for. And more important  I think  the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use  because there's fantastic synergy. Already  just in the last few days  we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about  that they're passionate about  that can make a difference in the world  and the idea of getting this group of people together    some of the causes that we believe in  the money that this conference can raise and the ideas    I really believe that that combination will  over time  make a difference. I'm incredibly excited about that. In fact  I don't think  overall  that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life. I'm in this for the long run  and I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me. I'm going to talk about two stories today. One is how we need to use market based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions in the transportation sector. And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies  how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce C   in the other sectors. I'm really scared. We need to reduce C   emissions in ten to fifteen years by    percent in order to avert catastrophic effects. And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that. What are catastrophic effects  A three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in    percent species extinction. It's not a movie. This is real life. And I'm really worried  because when people talk about cars    which I know something about    the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking   Let's use fuel efficient cars.  If we started today     years from now  at the end of this window of opportunity  those fuel efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent. That is not enough. But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things. Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes. So  Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago  but it's an example of something called car sharing. What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve  by the hour and by the day  instead of using their own car. How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar  It means that I pay only for what I need. All those hours when a car is sitting idle  I'm not paying for it. It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip. So  here's a woman that reserved MiniMia  and she had her day. I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients. I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip. And the other remarkable thing is it's  I think  the highest status of car ownership. Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call  but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have. I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. So  what is the social result of this  The social result is that today's Zipcar has         members driving       cars parked in       parking spaces. Instead of driving        miles a year  which is what the average city dweller does  they drive     miles a year. Are they happy  The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it  or greater. People adore the company. And it's better  you know  They like it. So  how is it that people went from the        miles a year to     miles  It's because they said   It's eight to    dollars an hour and    dollars a day. If I'm going to go buy some ice cream  do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream  Or maybe I'll do without. Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand.  So  people really respond very quickly to it  to prices. And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology. It required that it was completely trivial  that it takes    seconds to reserve a car  go get it  drive it. And for me  as a service provider  I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything. So  without these wireless technologies  this  as a concept  could never happen. So  here's another example. This company is GoLoco    I'm launching it in about three weeks    and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing. This will apply to people across all of America. Today     percent of the trips are single occupancy vehicles  yet    percent of trips to work are currently carpool. And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient. And so when I think about the future  people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day. You know  how did you get to TED  You went with other TEDsters. How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car  How did you go food shopping  You went with your neighbor  what a great social time. You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel  and it will also  I think  enhance our freedom of mobility. Where can I go today and who can I do it with  Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel. And the social benefits  the rate of single occupancy vehicles is  I told you     percent  I think we can get that down to    percent. The demand for parking  of course  is down  congestion and the CO  emissions. One last piece about this  of course  is that it's enabled by wireless technologies. And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this. The average American spends    percent of their income on their car  and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost  yet they have no outlet today. So  the last example of this is congestion pricing  very famously done in London. It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads. In London  the day they turned the congestion pricing on  there was a    percent decrease in congestion overnight  and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing. And again  do people like the outcome  Ken Livingstone was reelected. So again  we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness to reduce their driving behavior. We've tripled the miles that we drive since      and doubled them since     . There's a huge slack in that system  with the right pricing we can undo that. Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is  again  wirelessly enabled. You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London and open and shut those gates. And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing. And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go  because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes. And as we get our cars more fuel efficient  that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes  so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive. Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing. Why do we travel too much  Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over consumed. We need to put this better market feedback. And if we have it  you'll decide how many miles to drive  what mode of travel  where to live and work. And wireless technologies make this real time loop possible. So  I want to move now to the second part of my story  which is  when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing  Road pricing is coming. When are we going to do it  Are we going to wait    to    years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years  Because I'm going to say  that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight. And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use  This is my big vision. There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide  respond to emergencies  get traffic moving  provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce CO  emissions in every sector. And this is a moment from  The Graduate.  Do you remember this moment  You guys are going to be the handsome young guy and I'm going to be the wise businessman.  I want to say one word to you  just one word.   Yes  sir    Are you listening    Yes I am.   Ad hoc peer to peer self configuring wireless networks.  These are also called mesh networks. And in a mesh  every device contributes to and expands the network  and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before. I'm going to give you some examples. You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay. These laptops  when a child opens them up  they communicate with every single child in the classroom  within that school  within that village. And what is the cost of that communication system  Zero dollars a month. Here's another example  in New Orleans  video cameras were mesh enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter. When the hurricane happened  the only communication system standing was the mesh network. Volunteers flew in  added a whole bunch of devices  and for the next    months  mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans. Another example is in Portsmouth  U.K. They mesh enabled     buses and they speak to these smart terminals. You can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it's coming  and you can buy your tickets in real time. Again  all mesh enabled. Monthly communication cost  zero. So  the beauty of mesh networks  you can have these very low cost devices. Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable  you can just keep adding them  and as in Katrina  you can keep subtracting them    as long as there's some  we can still communicate. They're resilient  their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design. What are the incredible weaknesses  There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen    or in those municipalities  to build out their cities with these wireless networks    because there's zero ongoing communications cost. So  the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks  and networks are interesting only as they are big. How do we create a big network  Are you guys ready again     The Graduate   This time you will still play the handsome young thing  but I'll be the sexy woman. These are the next two lines in the movie.  Where did you do it    In his car.  So you know  when you stick this idea ...  Laughter  where would we expect me  Robin Chase  to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh network device in every single car across America. We could have a coast to coast  free wireless communication system. I guess I just want you to think about that. And why is this going to happen  Because we're going to do congestion pricing  we are going to do road tolls  gas taxes are going to become road pricing. These things are going to happen. What's the wireless technology we're going to use  Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it  Maybe we shouldn't wait for the    or    years for this to happen. We should pull it forward. So  I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system  and require that this network be accessible to everyone  with open standards. Right now in the transportation sector  we're creating these wireless devices    I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane    that are single purpose devices in these closed networks. What is the point  We're transferring just a few little data bits when we're doing road controlling  road pricing. We have this incredible excess capacity. So  we can provide the lowest cost means of going wireless coast to coast  we can have resilient nationwide communication systems  we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors. Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero. What you can do with that tool  we can create an economic engine. Information should be free  and access to information should be free  and we should be charging people for carbon. I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act  and I think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification. And if I had my druthers  we would have an open source version in addition to open standards. And this open source version means that it could be    if we did a brilliant job of it    it could be used around the world very quickly. So  going back to one of my earlier thoughts. Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network. When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize    his fabulous networks    imagine if there was an open source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks  to make all that happen. And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free. We could make billions of dollars on top of it  but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source. So  let's take control of this nightmare  implement a gas tax immediately  transition across the nation to road tolling with this wireless mesh  require that the mesh be open to all  with open standards  and  of course  use mesh networks. Thank you.  Applause  I hope you'll understand my English. In the mornings it is terrible  and the afternoon is worst. During many years  I made some speeches starting with this saying   City is not a problem  it's a solution.  And more and more  I'm convinced that it's not only a solution for a country  but it's a solution for the problem of climate change. But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities. I'm working in cities for almost    years  and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big  or the other mayors say   We don't have financial resources   I would like to say from the experience I had  every city in the world can be improved in less than three years. There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale  it's not a question of financial resources. Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co responsibility and also a design. So to start  I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers. The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together. And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura  and can we imagine  if we cut the casque of the turtle  how sad she's going to be  And that's what we're doing in our cities  living here  working here  having leisure here. And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. So  the other character is Otto  the automobile. He is invited for a party    he never wants to leave. The chairs are on the tables and still drinking  and he drinks a lot.  Laughter  And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical  he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure. Freeways. He's a very demanding person. And on the other hand  Accordion  the friendly bus  he carries     people        in Sweden      Brazilians.  Laughter  Speaking about the design  every city has its own design. Curitiba  my city  three million in the metropolitan area            people in the city itself. Curitiba  Rio  it's like two birds kissing themselves. Oaxaca  San Francisco    it's very easy  Market Street  Van Ness and the waterfront. And every city has its own design. But to make it happen  sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design    an idea that everyone  or the large majority  will help you to make it happen. And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. And it's an example of living and working together. And this is where we have more density  it's where we have more public transport. So  this system started in '  . We started with        passengers a day  now it's           passengers a day. And it took    years until another city ... which is Bogota  and they did a very good job. And now there's    cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba. And one thing  it's important not for only your own city  every city  besides its normal problems  they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity. That means mostly two main issues    mobility and sustainability    are becoming very important for the cities. And this is an articulated bus  double articulated. And we are very close to my house. You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there. And that's the evolution of the system. What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes  the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway. That's why  I'm trying to say  it's like metro nizing the bus. This is the design of the bus  and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding. And for handicapped  they can use this as a normal system. What I'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars    more than    percent    so when we depend only on cars  it's ...    that's why when we're talking about sustainability  it's not enough  green buildings. It's not enough  a new materials. It's not enough  new sources of energy. It's the concept of the city  the design of the city  that's also important  too. And also  how to teach the children. I'll speak on this later on. Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems. We started in '    proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus. The subway was against  of course. And    years after  they called us to develop    we're developing this idea. And you can understand how different it's going to be  the image of Rio with the system    one minute frequency. And it's not Shanghai  it's not being colored during the day  only at night it will look this way. And before you say it's a Norman Foster design  we designed this in '  . And this is the model  how it's going to work. So  it's the same system  the vehicle is different. And that's the model. What I'm trying to say is  I'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better. I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems  and with one condition  never    if you have a subway  if you have surface systems  if you have any kind of system    never compete in the same space. And coming back to the car  I always used to say that the car is like your mother in law  you have to have good relationship with her  but she cannot command your life. So  when the only woman in your life is your mother in law  you have a problem.  Laughter  So  all the ideas about how to transform through design    old quarries and open universities and botanic garden    all of it's related to how we teach the children. And the children  we teach during six months how to separate their garbage. And after  the children teach their parents. And now we have    percent    since    years  it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world. Seven zero. So teach the children. I would like to say  if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said  but don't forget the cities and the children. I'm working in a museum and also a multi use city  because you cannot have empty places during    hours a day. You should have always a structure of living and working together. Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the    hours. Another issue is  a city's like our family portrait. We don't rip our family portrait  even if we don't like the nose of our uncle  because this portrait is you. And these are the references that we have in any city. This is the main pedestrian mall  we did it in    hours. Yes  you have to be fast. And these are the references from our ethnic contribution. This is the Italian portal  the Ukrainian park  the Polish park  the Japanese square  the German park. All of a sudden  the Soviet Union  they split. And since we have people from Uzbekistan  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan   unclear   we have to stop the program. Don't forget  creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget. If you cut two zeros  it's much better. And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months. Parks    old quarries that they were transformed into parks. Quarries once made the nature  and sometimes we took this and we transformed. And every part can be transformed  every frog can be transformed in a prince. So  in a city  you have to work fast. Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture. That means me  with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning. And this is an acupuncture note    or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones can make the city better. The smallest park in New York  the most beautiful     meters. So  I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials    new sustainable materials    but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end  because we don't have the whole time to plan. And I think creativity  innovation is starting. And we cannot have all the answers. So when you start    and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers    it's important starting and having the contribution from people  and they could teach you if you're not in the right track. At the end  I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song. OK  Please  allow me just two minutes. You're going to make the music and the rhythm.   Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it  You can do it      Use less your car  Make this decision      Avoid carbon emission  It's possible  It's possible      You can do it  You can do it      Live closer to work      Work closer to home  Save energy in your home      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it      You can do it  Separate your garbage      Organic  schmorganic  Save more  Waste less  It's possible      You can do it  Please  do it now    Thank you. I draw to better understand things. Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing. Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for  The Way Things Work   while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding  spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner. Who knew about extension managers  I've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions  but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out  because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector  so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would. Now  I could talk about something that I'm known for  something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here  or I could talk about something I really care about. I decided to go with the latter. I'm going to talk about Rome. Now  why would I care about Rome  particularly  Well  I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '  s to study architecture. I was lucky enough to spend my last year  my fifth year  in Rome as a student. It changed my life. Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home  driving into RISD everyday  driving back. I missed the '  s. I read about them   Laughter  I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them  but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome  and it's a place that is never far from my mind. So  whenever given an opportunity  I try to do something in it or with it or for it. I also make drawings to help people understand things. Things that I want them to believe I understand. And that's what I do as an illustrator  that's my job. So  I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome. I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years. These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible    I need to. All different materials  all different styles  all different times  drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome. Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it. These are sketches of some of the little details. Rome is a city full of surprises. I mean  we're talking about unusual perspectives  we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast  sun drenched piazzas    never  though  piazzas that are not humanly scaled. Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically. That amazing juxtaposition of old and new  the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue    especially in the summer    compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets. And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form. How could I share my sense of Rome  my understanding of Rome  And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends  basically. The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going  you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency. Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning  maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome. And here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page. Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways. Maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this. Maybe I should get away from this map completely  and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air    which happens in so many of the squares in the city    and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits. That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot. But even though I just started this presentation  this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate. Eventually  I realized that I had really no content that I could count on  so I decided to move towards packaging.  Laughter  I mean  it seems to work for a lot of things. So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick. But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome. Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible. Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter  and very slow walking through Rome  you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across. Anyways  I went back to the dirigible notion. Went to Alberto Santos Dumont. Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome. This thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of  but it would be like having a ruler    sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler. Not that you know how long number    actually is  but you would be able to compare number    against the Pantheon with number    against the Baths of Caracalla  and so on and so forth. If you were interested. This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax  she has purchased a dirigible    a small dirigible    she's assembling the structure  Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off. She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city. Over the Spanish Steps we go. A nice way to show that river  that stream sort of pouring down the hill. Unfortunately  just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius  and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression  as you can see  as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius    gets a little too close  nudges it. This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius  which is really no more than a pile of quarters high    thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio  completely ruining the symmetry  but that aside a spectacular place to visit. A spectacular framework  inside of which you see  usually  extraordinary blue sky. Over the Pantheon and the    foot diameter Oculus. She parks her dirigible  lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside. The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around  and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view    looking in the hole  getting a different kind of perspective  moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus. Unfortunately for her  the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon  and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome  which would  from their point of view  naturally be hanging upside down. They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo  that little spiral structure you see there. She continues on her way over Piazza Navona. Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant  is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry. They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori  which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace  which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon  and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning. Anyway  the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff. Unfortunately  when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto  Ajax makes a lunge for it. She's managed to save the prosciutto  but in the process she loses the tablecloth  which you can see flying away in the upper left hand corner. They continue without their tablecloth  looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch. They eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes  ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up. Turns out to be the exterior wall    that part of it that remains    of the Coliseum  so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view. At the end of lunch  they untie the anchor  they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius  which has this lightning rod on top. Unfortunately  that's a problem  they get a little too close  and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes. So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion. Marcello  on the other hand  is sort of a lazy guy  but he's not due at work until about noon. So  the alarm goes off and it's five to    or so. He gets up  leaps onto his scooter  races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace  down the alleys  through the streets that tourists may be wandering through  disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn. That speed with which he is moving  I hope I have suggested in this little image  which  again  can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top  one of which is upside down in this image. So  he keeps on moving  approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street. Waiter catches on  but it's too late. And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter. Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine  but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do. Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric  it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself  or we find it. Right through the Piazza della Rotonda  in front of the Pantheon    again wreaking havoc    and finally getting to work. Marcello  as it turns out  is the driver of the number    bus  and if you've been on the number    bus  you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter. And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left hand corner. He's looking at his table  he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of    years   Laughter  and he wants it to be perfect. He's got candles out  he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses. But he's not happy  something's wrong. The phone rings anyway  he's called to the palazzo. He saunters    he saunters at a good clip  but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen  he's sauntering. Everybody knows Carletto  because he's in entertainment  actually  he's in television. He's actually in television repair  which is why people know him. So they all have his number. He arrives at the palazzo  arrives at the big front door. Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian  who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo  nobody's TVs are working and there's a big soccer game coming up  and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous. He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring  and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building  apartment by apartment  checking every television  checking every connection  hoping to find out what this problem is. He works his way up  finally  the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic. He opens the window of the attic  of course  and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna. He removes it  the problems are solved  everybody in the palazzo is happy. And of course  he also solves his own problem. All he has to do now  with a perfect table  is wait for her to arrive. That was the first attempt  but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome. So I thought  well  I'll just do piazzas  and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. And then I thought  that's too complicated. No  I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale  so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space. Now that's one drawing  so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.  Laughter  You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope. There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together. Then I thought   Wait a minute  what am I doing   A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information  it's a series of layers. I mean  you always peel one layer off another  we think of them as pages  doing it a certain way. But think of them as layers. I mean  Rome is a place of layers    horizontal layers  vertical layers    and I thought  well just peeling off a page would allow me to    if I got you thinking about it the right way    would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers. The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars  the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down. If I do a foldout page on the left hand side and let you just unfold it  you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue. You can see that in       it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever. Adaptations all get buried under the stucco. I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. But more importantly  I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks  or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco  which is more often the case. So it becomes slightly three dimensional. I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold    double foldout page    which  if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child  you hopefully stick your head into. You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time. And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages. But then I thought  maybe I could be simpler here. Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it. Here's a book completely wide open. OK  if I don't open the book the whole way  if I just open it    degrees  we're looking down the front of the Pantheon  and we're looking sort of at the top  more or less down on the square. And if I turn the book the other way  we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon. No foldouts  no tricks    just a book that isn't open the whole way. That seemed promising. I thought  maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book. So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth. And I thought  maybe I'm on the right track  but it sort of lost its human quality. So I went back to the notion of story  which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.  Pigeon's Progress  struck me as a catchy title. If it was a homing pigeon  it would be called  Homer's Odyssey.  But it was the journey of the ...  Laughter  I mean  if a title works  use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church. Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back  the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there's no way this pigeon can get home. So it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live  and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things  and we start with the tall ones and so on. Maybe it has to go back and live with family members  that's not always a good thing  but it does sort of bring pigeons together again. And I thought  that's sort of interesting  but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way. So I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons. He'll go anywhere to get them    dangerous places and whatnot    and they become really friends with this guy  and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that. There's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons. But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story. He's taught them to spell his name  which is Aldo. They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him    he lives in this little garret    and they spell his name and fly around. And he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof  and all the pigeons  a la Red Balloon  are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city. And I forgot to mention this  whenever he lost a pigeon  he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city. In the old Roman custom  the dead were never buried within the walls. And I thought that's a really cheery story. So anyway  I went through ... And again  if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere  I just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction. And sometimes it does focus me enough and I'll even do a title page. So  these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on  which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon    she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome    to someone in the city. And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here. You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way. If you see the red line  you are seeing the trail of the pigeon  if you don't see the red line  you are the pigeon. And it becomes necessary and possible  at this point  to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving. Past the Pyramid of Cestius    these will seem very familiar to you  even if you haven't been to Rome recently    past the gatehouse. This is something that's a little bit unusual. This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do  it takes the scenic route   Laughter  which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages. So  we circle around the Coliseum  past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river. We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese    designed by Michelangelo  built of stone taken from the Coliseum    narrow escape. We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori. This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization    a denial of any rules of perspective. The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable  you've succeeded. But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here  a couple are on Mars and a couple of others in Cremona. But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace  where invariably a soccer game is going on  and we're hit by a soccer ball. Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball. I have all the pieces  there's Santa Maria della Pace  there's a soccer ball  there's a little bit of a bird's wing    nothing's happening  so I had to rethink it. And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace  these books are really flexible  incredibly interactive    just turn it around and look at it the other way. Through the alley  we can see the impact is captured in the red line. And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower    one of the few remaining medieval towers    towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona    which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times  there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers    and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo  stopping just long enough on the    foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch our breath. And then we can swoop inside and around  and because we're flying  we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time  so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page. We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu  it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way. Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about  beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon  Ristorante  sign  and so on. And eventually  we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo  which is our destination. Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic  where somebody is working at the drawing board. He removes the message from the leg of the bird  this is what it says. As we look at the drawing board  we see what he's working on is  in fact  a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken  and the red line extends through all the sights. And if you want the information  so that we complete this cycle of understanding  all you have to do is read these paragraphs. Thank you very much. It's a simple idea about nature. I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days. I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals  and tell you about a tool  a very simple tool that I have found. Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit  it's not a technology. It's very powerful for  I think  changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend. And that tool is very simply  as Chris suggested  looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view. It's not my idea  other people have hit on it  but I've tried to take it to some new places. Let me tell you where I got it. Like a lot of my ideas  like a lot of the tools I use  I found it in the garden  I'm a very devoted gardener. And there was a day about seven years ago  I was planting potatoes  it was the first week of May    this is New England  when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom  they're just white clouds above. I was here  planting my chunks  cutting up potatoes and planting it  and the bees were working on this tree  bumblebees  just making this thing vibrate. And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration  you really can't get hurt    it's not like woodworking    and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation. And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden  working alongside that bumblebee  was  what did I and that bumblebee have in common  How was our role in this garden similar and different  And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common  both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another  and both of us    probably  if I can imagine the bee's point of view    thought we were calling the shots. I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant    I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn  or whatever it was    and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country  brought it  and I was planting it. And that bee  no doubt  assumed that it had decided   I'm going for that apple tree  I'm going for that blossom  I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave.  We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are  that we are sovereign subjects in nature  the bee as well as me. I plant the potatoes  I weed the garden  I domesticate the species. But that day  it occurred to me  what if that grammar is nothing more than a self serving conceit  Because  of course  the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge  but we know better. We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower. And when I say manipulated  I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense  right  I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits    color  scent  flavor  pattern    that has lured that bee in. And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar  and also picking up some powder on its leg  and going off to the next blossom. The bee is not calling the shots. And I realized then  I wasn't either. I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its    into spreading its genes  giving it a little bit more habitat. And that's when I got the idea  which was   Well  what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us   And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention  not as a human technology  but as a co evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species  mostly edible grasses  had exploited us  figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world. The competition of grasses  right  And suddenly everything looked different. And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience. I had thought always    and in fact  had written this in my first book  this was a book about gardening    that lawns were nature under culture's boot  that they were totalitarian landscapes  and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex. And that's what the lawn was. But then I realized   No  this is exactly what the grasses want us to do. I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns  whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees  who they compete with for sunlight.  And so by getting us to mow the lawn  we keep the trees from coming back  which in New England happens very  very quickly. So I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called  The Botany of Desire.  And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees    that they like sweetness  that they like this color and not that color  that they like symmetry    what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing  That a certain kind of potato  a certain kind of drug  a sativa indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us. And that  wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world  Now  the test of any idea    I said it was a literary conceit    is what does it get us  And when you're talking about nature  which is really my subject as a writer  how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test  Which is  does it make us better citizens of the biotic community  Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota  rather than its destruction  And I would submit that this idea does this. So  let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way  besides some entertaining insights about human desire. As an intellectual matter  looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly  which is    and this is in the realm of intellectual history    which is that we have this Darwinian revolution     years ago ... Ugh. Mini Me.  Laughter  We have this intellectual  this Darwinian revolution in which  thanks to Darwin  we figured out we are just one species among many  evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others  we are acted upon as well as acting  we are really in the fiber  the fabric of life. But the weird thing is  we have not absorbed this lesson     years later  none of us really believes this. We are still Cartesians    the children of Descartes    who believe that subjectivity  consciousness  sets us apart  that the world is divided into subjects and objects  that there is nature on one side  culture on another. As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view  you realize that the real literary conceit is that    is the idea that nature is opposed to culture  the idea that consciousness is everything    and that's another very important thing it does. Looking at the world from other species' points of view is a cure for the disease of human self importance. You suddenly realize that consciousness    which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature  human consciousness    is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world. And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool. But  you know  there's a comedian who said   Well  who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important  Well  consciousness.  So when you look at the plants  you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. I'll give you two examples  also from the garden  lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites  It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite  defending the lima bean. So what plants have    while we have consciousness  tool making  language  they have biochemistry. And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine. Their complexity  their sophistication  is something to really marvel at  and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project. You know  we went into it thinking         or        human genes and we came out with only       . Just to give you grounds for comparison  rice         genes. So who's the more sophisticated species  Well  we're all equally sophisticated. We've been evolving just as long  just along different paths. So  cure for self importance  way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea. And that's really what I do as a writer  as a storyteller  is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically. Now  the other use of this is practical. And I'm going to take you to a farm right now  because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned  in fact  is that we are all  now  being manipulated by corn. And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today  to me  is the final triumph of corn over good sense.  Laughter   Applause  It is part of corn's scheme for world domination. And you will see  the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us. So it helped me understand industrial agriculture  which of course is a Cartesian system. It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge  and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want. Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented  and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin. And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm  and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in    years of writing about nature. And that is this  the farm is called Polyface  which means ... the idea is he's got six different species of animals  as well as some plants  growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement. It's permaculture  those of you who know a little bit about this  such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ... what else does he have  All the six different species    rabbits  actually    are all performing ecological services for one another  such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another. It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance  but I'm going to just give you a close up on one piece of it  and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens  his laying hens. And I'll show you  if you take this approach  what you get  OK  And this is a lot more than growing food  as you'll see  this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero sum notion  the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning  and that for us to get what we want  nature is diminished. So  one day  cattle in a pen. The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing  relatively new  hooked to a car battery  even I could carry a quarter acre paddock  set it up in    minutes. Cows graze one day. They move  OK  They graze everything down  intensive grazing. He waits three days  and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile. The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption    it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards    but it houses     chickens. He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank  turns them down  and     hens come streaming down the gangplank    clucking  gossiping as chickens will    and they make a beeline for the cow patties. And what they're doing is very interesting  they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots  the grubs  the larvae of flies. And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day  those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem. But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein. So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs  and in the process they're spreading the manure out. Very useful second ecosystem service. And third  while they're in this paddock they are  of course  defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field. They then move out to the next one  and in the course of just a few weeks  the grass just enters this blaze of growth. And within four or five weeks  he can do it again. He can graze again  he can cut  he can bring in another species  like the lambs  or he can make hay for the winter. Now  I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there. So  it's a very productive system. And what I need to tell you is that on     acres he gets        pounds of beef         pounds of pork         dozen eggs         broilers        turkeys        rabbits    an immense amount of food. You know  you hear   Can organic feed the world   Well  look how much food you can produce on     acres if you do this kind of ... again  give each species what it wants  let it realize its desires  its physiological distinctiveness. Put that in play. But look at it from the point of view of the grass  now. What happens to the grass when you do this  When a ruminant grazes grass  the grass is cut from this height to this height  and it immediately does something very interesting. Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio  and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy. So when they lose a lot of leaf mass  they shed roots  they kind of cauterize them and the roots die. And the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots  decomposing them    the earthworms  the fungi  the bacteria    and the result is new soil. This is how soil is created. It's created from the bottom up. This is how the prairies were built  the relationship between bison and grasses. And what I realized when I understood this    and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is  he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer  he's not a sheep farmer  he's not a cattle rancher  he's a grass farmer  because grass is really the keystone species of such a system    is that  if you think about it  this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads  which is that for us to get what we want  nature is diminished. More for us  less for nature. Here  all this food comes off this farm  and at the end of the season there is actually more soil  more fertility and more biodiversity. It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do. There are a lot of farmers doing this today. This is well beyond organic agriculture  which is still a Cartesian system  more or less. And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species  take account of the soil  that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea    because there is no technology involved here except for those fences  which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time    that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process. This is a way to reanimate the world  and that's what's so exciting about this perspective. When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones  the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about. Thank you very much. I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done. Here is the old story    we've already heard a little bit about it  biology is war in which only the fiercest survive  businesses and nations succeed only by defeating  destroying and dominating competition  politics is about your side winning at all costs. But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge. It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines  in which cooperation  collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role. And the central  but not all important  role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room. I started thinking about the relationship between communication  media and collective action when I wrote  Smart Mobs   and I found that when I finished the book  I kept thinking about it. In fact  if you look back  human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co evolving for quite a long time. Humans have lived for much  much longer than the approximately        years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits  gathering food. The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive. But at some point  they banded together to hunt bigger game. And we don't know exactly how they did this  although they must have solved some collective action problems  it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups. And again  we have no way of knowing  but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged. More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted. So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms. Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families  And if so  how did they make arrangements  Again  we can't know  but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved. Of course  with agriculture came the first big civilizations  the first cities built of mud and brick  the first empires. And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks  marks on clay in that time. Not too much longer after that  the alphabet was invented. And this powerful tool was really reserved  for thousands of years  for the elite administrators  Laughter  who kept track of accounts for the empires. And then another communication technology enabled new media  the printing press came along  and within decades  millions of people became literate. And from literate populations  new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge  religion and politics. We saw scientific revolutions  the Protestant Reformation  constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before. Not created by the printing press  but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy. And again  new forms of wealth emerged. Now  commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads. But capitalism  as we know it  is only a few hundred years old  enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies  such as the joint stock ownership company  shared liability insurance  double entry bookkeeping. Now of course  the enabling technologies are based on the Internet  and in the many to many era  every desktop is now a printing press  a broadcasting station  a community or a marketplace. Evolution is speeding up. More recently  that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops  and very  very quickly  we're going to see a significant proportion  if not the majority of the human race  walking around holding  carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today. Now  when I started looking into collective action  the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call  social dilemmas.  And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas. I'm going to talk briefly about two of them  the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. Now  when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly  he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma  so I'm just going to go over that very  very quickly. If you have more questions about it  ask Kevin Kelly later.  Laughter  The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war  two players who couldn't trust each other. Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma. Person with the goods  person with the money  because they can't trust each other  are not going to exchange. Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff  but both lose  of course  because they don't get what they want. If they could only agree  if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game  they could proceed. Twenty years ago  Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question  if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors  how does cooperation exist at all  He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered  much to his surprise  that a very  very simple strategy won    it won the first tournament  and even after everyone knew it won  it won the second tournament    that's known as tit for tat. Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game  and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions. Here's how the game is played  there are two players  they've never played the game before  they will not play the game again  they don't know each other  and they are  in fact  in separate rooms. First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split                whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split    both players are paid and the game is over    or rejects the split    neither player is paid and the game is over. Now  the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get   . Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students  a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to      . And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before  proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to      . Now  the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered  to their surprise  that slash and burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures    each had radically different ideas of what is fair. Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness  that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions  whether we know that or not. The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons. Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late     s. He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource. He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it. Now  Elinor Ostrom  a political scientist  in      asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask  which is  is it really true that humans will always despoil commons  So she went out and looked at what data she could find. She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds  forestry resources  fisheries  and discovered that yes  in case after case  humans destroyed the commons that they depended on. But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma  in fact  the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma. And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be. They escape by creating institutions for collective action. And she discovered  I think most interestingly  that among those institutions that worked  there were a number of common design principles  and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work. I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines. In biology  the notions of symbiosis  group selection  evolutionary psychology are contested  to be sure. But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology  from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology. And again  our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned. Rational self interest is not always the dominating factor. In fact  people will act to punish cheaters  even at a cost to themselves. And most recently  neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain. Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together. Now  I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms. Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent  socialism emerged as a reaction to that. And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging. Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source  pointing to a new form of production  peer to peer production. I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past  new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth  we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones. Very briefly  let's look at some businesses. IBM  as you know  HP  Sun    some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software  are providing portfolios of patents for the commons. Eli Lilly    in  again  the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world    has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems. Toyota  instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace  treats them as a network and trains them to produce better  even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors. Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism  they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self interest. Open source production has shown us that world class software  like Linux and Mozilla  can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them. Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense. Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to        developers  countless Amazon shops. They're enriching others  not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves. eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game. Instead of   Neither of us can trust each other  so we have to make suboptimal moves   it's   You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate.  Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in     languages in just a couple of years. We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world  including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now  it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it  illiterates can be trained to use it. BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader  making the system more efficient the more it is used. Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers    that's Folding home at Stanford    to crack codes  to search for life in outer space. I don't think we know enough yet. I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are  but I think we can begin to think about them. And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them  but think about self interest. This is all about self interest that adds up to more. In El Salvador  both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy. In the U.S.  in the Philippines  in Kenya  around the world  citizens have self organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS. Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible  A transdisciplinary study of cooperation  I believe that the payoff would be very big. I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines. And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people    and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things    but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago  people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits. Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking. When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease  suffering was alleviated. What forms of suffering could be alleviated  what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation  I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen  it's going to require effort. So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started. Thank you. Thank you. Ooh  I'm like   Phew  phew  calm down. Get back into my body now.   Laughter  Usually when I play out  the first thing that happens is people scream out   What's she doing    I'll play at these rock shows  be on stage standing completely still  and they're like   What's she doing   What's she doing    And then I'll kind of be like     Vvvwow      and then they're like   Whoa   I'm sure you're trying to figure out   Well  how does this thing work   Well  what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand. See  the closer I get to this antenna  the higher the note gets    and you can get it really low. And with this hand I'm controlling the volume  so the further away my right hand gets  the louder it gets. So basically  with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes  when really it's continuously going ... Sometimes I startle myself  I'll forget that I have it on  and I'll lean over to pick up something  and then it goes like     Blip      Oh   And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don't turn the thing off. Maybe we'll go into the next tune  because I totally lost where this is going. We're going to do a song by David Mash called  Listen  the Words Are Gone   and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax. So  I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked  there are so many. And ... Well  I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin. It was invented around the     s  and the inventor  L on Theremin    he also was a musician besides an inventor    he came up with the idea for making the theremin  I think  when he was working on some shortwave radios. And there'd be that sound in the signal    it's like  Screeching     and he thought   Oh  what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument  because there are pitches in it.  And so somehow through developing that  he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now. And a lot of times  even kids nowadays  they'll make reference to a theremin by going   Whoo hoo hoo hoo   because in the '  s it was used in the sci fi horror movies  that sound that's like ...  Woo hoo hoo hoo  It's kind of a funny  goofy sound to do. And sometimes if I have too much coffee  then my vibrato gets out of hand. You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing. You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on    what Michael was doing    because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune  and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time  you want to be feeling the music. And then also  you're trying to stay very  very  very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch  or sometimes if you're holding a low note     Tone rising out of key     and breathing will make it ... If I pass out on the next song ... I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing  or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing  you don't want to have any sudden movements. And if I go to a club and play a gig  people are like   Here  have some drinks on us   And it's like   Well  I'm about to go on soon  I don't want to be like     Teetering tones     you know   It really does reflect the mood that you're in also  if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist  except instead of it coming out of your throat  you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference  you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly. You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it  adjust it  and just move on  or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me. I think we will play another tune now. I'm going to do  Lush Life.  It's one of my favorite tunes to play. I'm a historian. Steve told us about the future of little technology  I'm going to show you some of the past of big technology. This was a project to build a       ton nuclear bomb propelled spaceship and go to Saturn and Jupiter. This took place in my childhood         . It was deeply classified. I'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified  but has now been reclassified. If all goes well  next year I'll be back  and I'll have a lot more to show you  and if all doesn't go well  I'll be in jail  like Wen Ho Lee. So  this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel  a little taller and a little bigger. And one of the people who worked on it at the beginning was my father  Freeman  there in the middle. That's me and my sister  Esther  who's a frequent TEDster. I didn't like nuclear bomb propelled spaceships. I mean  I thought it was a great idea  but I started building kayaks. So we had a few kayaks. Just so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove. But all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd  beautiful parts of this planet  I always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion  and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships. They were actually going to go    Ted Taylor  who led the project  was going to take his children. My father was not going to take his children  that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years. The project began in '   at General Atomics there  that's right on the coast at La Jolla. Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture. That's the     foot diameter library. That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship. So put that library at the bottom of that ship    that's how big the thing was going to be. It would take two or three thousand bombs. The people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work. It was the first project funded by ARPA. That's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars to get this thing started.  Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson.  That's July '  . Two days later  the space traveler's manifesto explaining why    just like we heard yesterday    why we need to go into space   ... trips to satellites of the outer planets. August         .  These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop. Some of the sizes of the ships  ranging all the way up to ship mass of   million tons. So that was the outer extreme. Here was version two        bombs. These are five kiloton yield bombs  about the size of small Volkswagens  it would take     to get into orbit. Here we see a        ton ship will deliver       tons to Saturn and back    essentially  a five year trip. Possible departure dates  October      to February     . These are trajectories going to Mars. All this was done by hand  with slide rules. The little Orion ship  and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals  you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building. NASA had no interest  they tried to kill the project. The people who supported it were the Air Force  which meant that it was all secret. And that's why when you get something declassified  that's what it looks like. Military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet. There's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union. This is the really secret stuff  how to get directed energy explosions. So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion    not like just a stick of dynamite  but you're directing it at the ship. And this is still a very active subject. It's quite dangerous  but I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you're going to keep them secret. This is what happened at     microseconds. The Air Force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this. The guys in La Jolla said   We've got to get started now.  They built a high explosive propelled model. These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't  and kept it in their basement for the last    years. So  these are three pound charges of C   that's about    times what the guy had in his shoes. This is Ed Day putting    So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C  in it. They're building a system that ejects these at quarter second intervals. That's my dad in the sport coat there  holding the briefcase. So  they had a lot of fun doing this. But no children were allowed  my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn  but he could not say anything more about it. So all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out  and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down. These are stills from the video. Jeff Bezos kindly  yesterday  said he'll put this video up on the Amazon site    some little clip of it. So  thanks to him. They got quite serious about the engineering of this. The size of that mass  for us  is really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to. If you saw the         this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment  that's acceleration profile. And pulse system yield  we're looking at    kiloton yield for an effective thrust of    million newtons. Well  here we have a little problem  the radiation doses at the crew station      rads per shot. Fission yields during development  they were hoping to get clean bombs  they didn't. Eyeburn  this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up. Personnel compartment noise  that's not too bad  it's very low frequencies  it's basically like these sub woofers. And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow up on the pad. Finally  at the very end in       NASA steps in and says   OK  we'll support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together.  So this is what NASA did  getting an eight man version that would go to Mars. They liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like   It's like living in a submarine.  This is crew compartment. It switches  so what's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode. The scientists were still going to go along  they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists. This is a    man version for going to Jupiter  bunks  storm cellars  exercise room. You know  it was going to be a nice  long trip. The Air Force version  here we have a military version. This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified  just that people managed to sneak home and after  you know  on their deathbed  basically  gave me that. The sort of artist conceptions. These are basically PowerPoint presentations given to the Air Force    years ago. Look at the little guys there outside the vehicle. And one part of NASA was interested in it  but the headquarters in NASA  they killed the project. So finally  at the end  we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to       and then all those paths came to a halt. Results  none. This project is hereby terminated. So that's the end. All I can say in closing is  we heard yesterday that one of the    bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it. And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out  and everybody says   Well  what are we going to do   And Orion is really one of the only  if not the only  off the shelf technologies that could do something. So I'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news. The good news is that NASA has a small  secret contingency plan division that is looking at this  trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune. Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side. That's the good news. The bad news is  when I got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them  they went crazy because I had all this stuff that they don't have  and NASA purchased       pages of this stuff from me. So that's the state we're at  it's not very good. So  what I'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to Kahn's heart  which is  how do we discover what is really particular about a project  How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person  Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization  that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building. And so I'll take you to Wichita  Kansas  where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site  right downtown by the river. And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river  part of the river. Unfortunately  though  the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard so I suggested   Let's reroute McLean   and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard. And it took six months to reroute it. The first image I showed the building committee was this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur because I talked about what makes a building a building of science. And it seemed to me that this structure    complex  rich and yet totally rational  it's an instrument    had something to do with science  and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that. And so my first sketch after I left was to say   Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building.  And I got all excited and came back  and they sort of looked at me in dismay and said   An island  This used to be an island    Ackerman Island    and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs.  And so the process began and they said   You can't put it all on an island  some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community.  And there emerged a design  the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof. And there were all kinds of exciting features  you could come in through the landside buildings  walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape. If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof  peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced  come back and pay the five dollars admission. And the client was happy    well  sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget  but essentially happy. But I was still troubled  and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious. It was complex  but there was something capricious about its complexity. It was  what I would say  compositional complexity  and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about    a building for science    there had to be some kind of a generating idea  some kind of a generating geometry. And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry  one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building. A toroid  for those who don't know  is the surface of a doughnut or  for some of us  a bagel. And out of this idea started spinning off many  many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities  and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits  and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry. And finally the building    this is the model. And when there were complaints about budget  I said   Well  it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money  reflections.  And here's the building as it opened  with a channel overlooking downtown  and as seen from downtown. And the bike route's going right through the building  so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building. The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building  every beam in this building is the same radius  all laminated wood. Every wall  every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building. Every piece of the building works. These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights  and at night  and on opening day. Going back to     . In       I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem  which you see here the campus. I was asked to do a building  and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings. And I felt very troubled. I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum  they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information  it would make them just unable to digest. And so I made a counter proposal  I said   No building.  There was a cave on the site  we tunnel into the hill  descend through the rock into an underground chamber. There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space. There is a single candle flickering in the center  by an arrangement of reflective glasses  it reflects into infinity in all directions. You walk through the space  a voice reads the names  ages and place of birth of the children. This voice does not repeat for six months. And then you descend to light and to the north and to life. Well  they said   People won't understand  they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that.  And they shelved the project. And it sat there for    years  and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles  who had lost his three year old son at Auschwitz  came  saw the model  wrote the check and it got built    years later. So  many years after that in       I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying   We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here. He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem  we took him to the children's memorial  he was extremely moved. He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv   And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me   We Sikhs have suffered a great deal  as you have Jews. I was very moved by what I saw today. We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people  we're about to embark on that. I'd like you to come and design it.  And so  you know  it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously. But two weeks later  I was in this little town  Anandpur Sahib  outside Chandigarh  the capital of the Punjab  and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the Sikhs  Guru Gobind  died in as he wrote the Khalsa  which is their holy scripture. And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there  nine kilometers away from the town and the temple  and said   That's where we have chosen the location.  And I said   This just doesn't make any sense. The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands    they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there. Let's get back to the town and walk to the site.  And I recommended they do it right there  on that hill and this hill  and bridge all the way into the town. And  as things are a little easier in India  the site was purchased within a week and we were working. And my proposal was to split the museum into two    the permanent exhibits at one end  the auditorium  library  and changing exhibitions on the other    to flood the valley into a series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown. And the structures rise from the sand cliffs    they're built in concrete and sandstones  the roofs are stainless steel    they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself  pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other. And as you come from the north  it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. And then I went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking. And I came back and  lo and behold  the little model I'd left behind had been built ten times bigger for public display on site and ... the bridge was built  Within the working drawings  And half a million people gathered for the celebrations  you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning. I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction  there are       workers at work and it will be finished in two years. Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began  Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now Washington was built    the Holocaust Museum in Washington    and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information. And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point. They said   Let's rebuild the museum.  But of course  the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter    the Jews make it hard  international competition  phase one  phase two  phase three. And again  I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the Washington building           square feet    will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries    rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms    to tell the story of the Holocaust. And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch. Just cut the whole museum through the mountain    enter from one side of the mountain  come out on the other side of the mountain    and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers. And here you see the model  a reception building and some underground parking. You cross a bridge  you enter this triangular room     feet high  which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north. And all of it  then  all the galleries are underground  and you see the openings for the light. And at night  just one line of light cuts through the mountain  which is a skylight on top of that triangle. And all the galleries  as you move through them and so on  are below grade. And there are chambers carved in the rock    concrete walls  stone  the natural rock when possible    with the light shafts. This is actually a Spanish quarry  which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be. And then  coming towards the north  it opens up  it bursts out of the mountain into  again  a view of light and of the city and of the Jerusalem hills. I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months. It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington  the U.S. Institute of Peace. The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial  you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall  on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia. That too was a competition  and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site. If it were to be anywhere in Washington  it would be an office building  a conference center  a place for negotiating peace and so on    all of which the building is    but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial  this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall. And that was a lot of heat to deal with. The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces    spaces where research goes on  conference centers  a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking    and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition  the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry. You see the structure as  in the sequence of structures on the Mall  very transparent and inviting and looking in. And then as you enter it again  looking in all directions towards the city. And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being    to quote Kundera    that it had to do with whiteness  it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism. And this is where it is  it's sort of evolving. Studies for the structure of the roof  which demands maybe new materials  how to make it white  how to make it translucent  how to make it glowing  how to make it not capricious. And here studying  in three dimensions  how to give some kind  again  of order  a structure  not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process. And so it goes. I'd like to conclude by saying something ... I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term  beauty.  And I know it is not a fashionable term these days  and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools  but it seems to me that all this  in one way or the other  is a search for beauty. Beauty in the most profound sense of fit. I have a quote that I like by a morphologist        Theodore Cook  who said   Beauty connotes humanity. We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness  the perfect fulfillment of function.  Well  I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose. Nevertheless  beauty as the kind of fit  something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled    and our human environment    for that. Twenty years ago  in a conference Richard and I were at together  I wrote a poem  which seems to me to still hold for me today.  He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity. He who seeks order shall find gratification. He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed. He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self expression. He who seeks self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance. Arrogance is incompatible with nature. Through nature  the nature of the universe and the nature of man  we shall seek truth. If we seek truth  we shall find beauty.  Thank you very much.

I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox  and Wendy and I wanted you to do the theme song. And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad  but I kept remaining a fan of yours. And then when I went through that big  horrible breakup with Carl and I couldn't get off the couch  I listened to your song     Now That I Don't Have You     over and over and over and over again. And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED. And also  I can't believe that we're eating sushi in front of the fish tank  which  personally  I think is really inappropriate.

Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine. I mean  I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane visiting my mother. And to my mother  Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope  which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic. Anyway  I like Oprah    I like her girlfriendy ness  I like her weight issues  I like how she's transformed talk television  I like how she's brought reading back to America    but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon Yi moment  it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone. And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie  The Secret.  Do you guys know about that movie  The Secret   It makes  What the Bleep Do We Know  seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics    that's how bad it is. It makes  The DaVinci Code  seem like  War and Peace.  That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience. And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction  and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you. On a scientific basis  it's more than just  Power of Positive Thinking     it has a horrible  horrible dark side. Like if you get ill  it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts. Yeah  stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is  in fact  not a law. So that's what I have to say.

Barry Friedman  There are all kinds of high tech chairs here today  but this is really  I think  when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics  comfort  design  flexibility ... DH  Now obviously  this is not something we do on our regular show  it's something we just kind of learned for this  so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs  BF  Nice show  Daniel  nice show. You are the man  Nice show. Man  that was good  DH  Thank you. BF  You know  sometimes when people do those  they go all the way down. You actually just did that.  Laughter  That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... DH  All right  let's show them something special. BF  ... without a MacArthur grant. Yeah  look at this. You know  all kinds of different ... TED is about invention  let's be honest. Right  DH  Yeah  it is. BF  Last night  Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on. Right now  Dan's going to show something he actually invented. DH  A type of juggling I actually invented  right after I saw another juggler do it. BF  Shut up.  Laughter  DH  And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. Folks  this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down. BF  Oh yeah  it does.  Drum roll  BF  Oh  Daniel. DH  One more   Drum roll  Perfect.  Drum roll  Perfect.  Drum roll  BF  OK. DH  Oh  All right. I'm now pushing my luck  I'm skipping right to six cups. In order to do six cups  I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.  Drum roll  BF  Also three with his left. DH  Perfect. And now  all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose   Laughter  BF  First try  Once on purpose  DH  How about if I try first and then decide  BF  Good idea.  Laughter  Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open. DH  He's looking at me. BF  That's all right  he does that. All right. DH  Oh  It's time for Richard's help.  Laughter  Oh  good. All right. BF  You know  over the years  every year at the conference  it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny  for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons. And then we thought   How stupid.  DH  Excuse me  could we work on the design of the microphone  BF  I think that's the next session. DH  Next session  BF  Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this. He actually assumes more of the danger in this. DH  Please stand up  Richard.  Whip cracks  Oh  sorry.  Laughter  DH  Now Richard  please ...  Whip cracks  BF  OK  sorry. DH  Jesus Christ. Richard  please stand in front of me. Richard Wurman  Can I say something  BF  Sure. RW  In all past years I've rehearsed with them  the things that have happened to me    I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. DH  All right  please stand here in front ... God  I hate that. Put your hands out like this  please. BF  No  come stay up with him. Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection. It's kind of neat. OK. DH  Wow  you've been working out. BF  No  shut up  Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice  that's good. OK  here we go. Have him hold your wrist so I can ... DH  Please hold my wrist  will you. BF  Yeah  hold this a minute. There you go. OK. OK  hold on. RW  Hmmm. DH  First one. BF  All those mid year phone calls are coming back to me now  Richard. DH  So Richard  what were we on the list  Like        What happened there  BF  I think we were just outside. DH  I don't get it.  Applause  DH  Sorry. BF  Having some bad flashbacks. RW  Do you want me to hold you or not  DH  Don't hold me that hard. BF  Here we go  I'm taking it.  Balloon pops   Applause  DH  One more  one more. BF  We've got one more we're going to do. RW  Do I get to hold them  BF  You don't want to hold these  trust me. DH  Could you spread your legs a little bit  BF  Gloria  you want to do it  It's very cool. One more try. Man  I don't want to get too close. Could you just push that  DH  Wow  Boy  BF  That's cool. I always wanted to try that. DH  Let's jump this way  though. Now  we risked Richard's life  it's only fair we risk our own lives. So to do that  I will juggle these three razor sharp sickles. And if that wasn't enough  and judging by your response  it's not ... DH  Wow  BF  Hoping for a little more build. DH  True. Barry ... BF  I'm going to run up behind him. DH  Leap over my shoulder. BF  Up and over his shoulders. DH  Grab the blades in mid air  land right there in a pool of blood ... Still juggling.  Laughter  Impossible  you say  BF  Incredible  you say  DH  Why bother  you say  BF  Here we go. DH  Just do it juggler boys  you say  BF  This guy  this guy invented air. DH  I think so  that's right. Even the pencil. BF  He invented the pencil. DH  All right  we'll do this trick  but please remember it took us over    years to perfect. BF  Ten years to perfect  which you're about to see. DH  It's not that difficult  we just don't like to practice that much. BF  No  it's a hassle. Traveling too much. Actually  we will take a second to prove    this could be fake    that the blades are indeed razor sharp. DH  Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage  Or a virgin for a sacrifice  BF  Anything  DH  Where's Gloria   Laughter  BF  No  she's got ... farm animal. DH  Do you have a small farm animal  Just trying to play the odds. All right  here we go. BF  Over the top  over the top. DH  How you feeling  Barry  You feeling all right  BF  Yeah  it's all right. DH  Do you feel everything's OK  The atmosphere  the ... BF  Yeah  a little sketchy. DH  Everything up here's OK  BF  Yeah. DH  Then here we go. BF  This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights  Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs  Is that possible   Laughter  I can still see a little. DH  And turn up the intensity  we're still pink in the middle. We went too far.  Laughter  BF  Yeah  it's too far. It's too much of a visual. The design of the body is a whole different thing. DH  Ready  Barry  BF  Over the top. DH  May we have our jumping music please   Silence  May we have it a bit louder  BF  They're a good crew  Whoa  DH  Whoa  sorry. All right. BF  We're going on. DH  All right  we'll try again. BF  All right  Oh my gosh. Oh. DH  All right  here we go. Sorry about that. BF  I thought I had the hard part. OK. DH  Whenever you're ready. BF  There we go  All right  get up  Come on and dance  DH  Dance  come on. BF  Come on and dance  Somebody dance  Come on  Wow  wow  OK  stop. Weird  no one dances. We're two guys doing this.  Laughter  I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. DH  The French judge ... BF  One more quick thing. DH  The French judge gives it a  . . BF  Well  you know ... DH  There you go ... BF  Oh  yeah. Another one coming in. DH  Tell them about our bio and stuff. BF  Yeah. In our bio  some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships. And believe it or not  you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups. We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition. DH  That's right. BF  Good. DH  I know what you're thinking  other juggling teams must really suck. BF  Juggling's got a bad rap. DH  But wait  Barry  there's still one more club lying there by my foot. And look  it has a twin  BF  Shut up.  Laughter  DH  There's still one more by my foot. What do you want me to do with it  BF  Richard you tell him  it's your last year.  Laughter  DH  That's a pretty good setup  Richard. BF  Yeah  it's a good setup. That's a big setup. DH  You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do  I will use my panther like reflexes. BF  Nice. DH  I got that    to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. BF  Nice. DH  I touched it  Barry. That should be enough. BF  It's progress  that's the thing. DH  How about that  I'll do it again. Oh wait  it's on your side  Barry. And it's awfully windy over there. BF  It is  it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage  but it is. It's weird. Watch this  what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. DH  Wow  What a great trick  Barry  Oh  look how it lies there. Oh  Barry  is there nothing you can't do  You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea  Jr. Too much Olympics. BF  From my foot  I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. DH  Where  Barry  Where  Tell us  Barry.  Unclear  eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be  What gem of knowledge  What pearl of wisdom  Do you want to buy a vowel  Barry  Is that your final answer  BF  All right  You have to turn off the TV from time to time. DH  I do  I do. BF  From my foot  the kick up in the seven. DH  We will juggle seven. BF  From six to seven. DH  That's a world's record. BF  Really  DH  For us. BF  Yes. DH  Whenever you're ready there  big guy. Put your tongue away  Barry. BF  Oh  oh  whoa. DH  Please  please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. Because now  to make this twice as difficult  we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... BF  Seven club juggling. DH  ... to back. BF  Thank you  that's it. BF  Thank you guys  DH  Thank you very much  My name is Joseph  a Member of Parliament in Kenya. Picture a Maasai village  and one evening  government soldiers come  surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school. That's how I went to school    pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father   You have to make a choice.  I walked very comfortably to this missionary school  that was run by an American missionary. The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy. I had never in my life ever tasted candy. So I said to myself  with all these hundred other boys  this is where I belong. When everybody else was dropping out. My family moved  we're nomads. It was a boarding school  I was seven    Every time it closed you had to travel to find them.       miles  it doesn't matter. You slept in the bush  but you kept going. And I stayed. I don't know why  but I did. All of a sudden I passed the national examination  found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya. And I finished high school. And just walking  I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States. My mother still lived in a cow dung hut  none of my brothers were going to school  and this man told me   Here  go.  I got a scholarship to St. Lawrence University  Upstate New York  finished that. And after that I went to Harvard Graduate School  finished that. Then I worked in DC a little bit  I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history. And every time  I kept going back home  listening to their problems    sick people  people with no water  all this stuff    every time I go back to America  I kept thinking about them. Then one day  an elder gave me a story that went like this  long time ago  there was a big war between tribes. This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe. Every time  they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them. So one day  the scouts came running and told the villagers   The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away  they'll be here.  So people scrambled  took their things and ready to go  move out. But there were two men  one man was blind  one man had no legs    he was born like that. The leader of the chiefs said   No  sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down. We have to flee our women and children  we have to run.  And they were left behind  waiting to die. But these two people worked something out. The blind man said   Look  I'm a very strong man but I can't see.  The man with no legs says   I can see as far as the end of the world  but I can't save myself from a cat  or whatever animals.  The blind man went down on his knees like this  and told the man with no legs to go over his back  and stood up. The man on top can see  the blind man can walk. These guys took off  followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them. So  this was told to me in a setup of elders. And it's a really poor area. I represent Northern Kenya  the most nomadic  remote areas you can even find. And that man told me   So  here you are. You've got a good education from America  you have a good life in America  what are you going to do for us  We want you to be our eyes  we'll give you the legs. We'll walk you  you lead us.  The opportunity came. I was always thinking about that   What can I do to help my people  Every time you go to an area where for    years of independence  we still don't have basic health facilities. A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow    km for a hospital. No clean drinking water. So I said   I'm going to dedicate myself. I'm leaving America. I'm going to run for office.  Last June  I moved from America  ran in July election and won. And I came for them  and that's my goal. Right now I have in place  for the last nine months  a plan that in five years  every nomad will have clean drinking water. We're building dispensaries across that constituency. I'm asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out. I'm trying to improve infrastructure. I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward. I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because people from outside can come and help us  but if we don't help ourselves  there's nothing to do. My plan right now as I continue with introducing students to different fields    some become doctors  some lawyers    we want to produce a comprehensive group of people  students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession. As I continue to be a Member of Parliament and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany  health  democracy  new inventions  I'm hoping that one day in my own little community    which is        square km  maybe five times Rhode Island    with no roads  we'll be able to become a model to help others develop. Thank you very much. By day  I'm a venture capitalist. On weekends  I love rockets. I love photography  I love rockets  and I'm going to talk to you about a hobby that can scale and show you some photos that I've taken over the years with kids like these  kids that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become maybe another Richard Branson or Diamandis. My son designed a rocket that became stable  a golf ball rocket    I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science    and it flies straight as an arrow. Baking soda and vinegar. Night shots are beautiful  piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way. Two stage rockets  rockets with video cameras on them  on board computers logging their flights  rocket gliders that fly back to Earth. I use RockSim to simulate flights before they go to see if they'll break supersonic or not  and then fly them with on board computers to verify their performance. But to launch the really big stuff  you go to the middle of nowhere  Black Rock Desert  where dangerous things happen. And the boys get bigger  and the rockets get bigger.  Laughter  And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters. They rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle. These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide. They use solid propellant most frequently. It's a strange kind of love. We have a RocketMavericks.com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this  participate  be a spectator. Mavericks  we had to call it Rocket Mavericks. This one was great  it went to         feet  but didn't quite. Actually  it went    feet into the solid clay  and it became a bunker buster  drilling down into the clay. It had to be dug out. Rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them. Here was a drag race. At night you can see what happened in a second  in daytime  we call them land sharks. Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic. To take this shot  I do what I often do  which is go way beyond the pads where none of the other spectators are. And if we can run the video  I'll show you what it took to get this DreamWorks shot. Steve Jurvetson  This is rare. Here's where they realized the computer's failed. They're yelling deploy. Voices  Oh shit. SJ  This is when they realize everything on board's gone haywire. Voices  It's going ballistic. Oh shit. SJ  And I'll just be quiet. Voices  No. Up  up  up. SJ  And that's me over there  taking photos the whole way. Things often go wrong. Some people watch this event because of a NASCAR like fascination with things bumping and grinding. Burning the parachute as it fell    that was last weekend. This guy went up  went supersonic  ripped the fin can off    yard sale in the sky    and a burning metal hunk coming back. These things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch. It's a cadence you can't quite imagine. And in many ways  I try to capture the mishaps  it's the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second. Why do they do it  It's for things like this  Gene from Alabama drives out there with this rocket that he's built with X ray sensors  video cameras  festooned with electronics  and he succeeds getting to         feet  leaving the atmosphere  seeing a thin blue line of space. It is this breathtaking image    success  of course    that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science  to understand the importance of physics and math and  in many ways  to sort of have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown. Thank you. Roy Gould  Less than a year from now  the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy  which marks the    th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope. In a few months  the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research  which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago. It's called the WorldWide Telescope  and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. And I want to urge you  when you get a chance  to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs. The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space  and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe. It's going to change the way we do astronomy  it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day  that might not be so big a claim. In       for example  you weren't allowed to drink  if you were a woman  you weren't allowed to vote  and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night  what you saw was thought to be the entire universe. In fact  the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe. Harvard was wrong  big time.  Laughter  Of course  we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy. We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe  all the way back in time  almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself. We can see across the entire spectrum of light  revealing worlds that had previously been invisible. We see these magnificent star nurseries  where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise. We see alien worlds  we see alien solar systems        now  and still counting    and they're not like us. We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy  in the Milky Way  and elsewhere in the universe  where time itself seems to stand still. But until now  our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented  and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing. I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I  in astronomy and in education  are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative. First  it enables you to experience the universe  the WorldWide Telescope  for me  is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go. Second  you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides. And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing  but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe  who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place. And third  you can create your own tours    you can share them with friends  you can create them with friends    and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart  we are all storytellers. And in telling stories  each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. We're going to have a personal universe. I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge. Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope  I just want to leave you with this brief thought  when I ask people   How does the night sky make you feel   they often say   Oh  tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant.  Well  our gaze fills the universe. And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope  we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe. I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny  but we are truly  wonderfully significant. Thank you. I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft.  Applause  Curtis Wong  Thank you  Roy. So  what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation  but it's one of the tours. And actually this tour is one that was created earlier. And the tours are all totally interactive  so that if I were to go somewhere ... you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way  pull up other information    there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go    you can zoom in  you can pull back out. The whole resources are there available for you. So  Microsoft    this is a project that    WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray  who's our colleague  and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible. It's a labor of love for us and our small team  and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe. So basically  kids of all ages  like us. And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring. It'll be a free download    thank you  Craig Mundie    and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org  which is something new. And so  what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here  and in the TED Lab  we have a tour that was created by a six year old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off.  Laughter  So we'll see you there. Thank you. A great way to start  I think  with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED. Here you are  understanding why we're here  what's going on with no difficulty at all. The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing  and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point. He would have a great time. And of course  if you're a speaker here  like Hans Rosling  a speaker finds this complex  tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case  he had a secret weapon yesterday  literally  in his sword swallowing act. And I must say  I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on  but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing. So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense  but that we're easily fooled. In fact  what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled  so we're actually looking forward to it. We go to magic shows in order to be fooled. And this makes many things fun  but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves. And our friend  Betty Edwards  the  Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain  lady  shows these two tables to her drawing class and says   The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can't move your hand  but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty. It's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what's there.  And to prove it  she says   The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same  and I'm going to prove it to you.  She does this with cardboard  but since I have an expensive computer here I'll just rotate this little guy around and ... Now having seen that    and I've seen it hundreds of times  because I use this in every talk I give    I still can't see that they're the same size and shape  and I doubt that you can either. So what do artists do  Well  what artists do is to measure. They measure very  very carefully. And if you measure very  very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge  you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size. And the Talmud saw this a long time ago  saying   We see things not as they are  but as we are.  I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then  if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion. So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are  then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream  and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history. And what that means   simple and understandable  might not be actually simple or understandable  and things we think are  complex  might be made simple and understandable. Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws. We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel. The way I think of it is  we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind. Once you start down at this very humble level  then you can start finding ways to see things. And what's happened  over the last     years in particular  is that human beings have invented  brainlets     little additional parts for our brain    made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways. And these are in the form of sensory apparatus    telescopes  microscopes    reasoning apparatus    various ways of thinking    and  most importantly  in the ability to change perspective on things. I'll talk about that a little bit. It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last     years than we have in the rest of human history. And yet  it is not taught in any K through    curriculum in America that I'm aware of. So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more. We like more. If we do more in a kind of a stupid way  the simplicity gets complex and  in fact  we can keep on doing it for a very long time. But Murray Gell Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties  another name for them could be  architecture  as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non obvious  non simple ways of combining it. And in fact  what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature    of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar    all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish  and they're in violent motion. Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world. But how simple  So  when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago  I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen in conveying complex ideas simply. But then I had a thought of   Boy  maybe it's too simple.  And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side  and I found that they matched up very well. So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what's important about the data. Whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell  as a former molecular biologist  I didn't like that at all. Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything  but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology  and that is  why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed  And what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous  they just swooped in the air and bound  and something happened. But in fact  those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second  they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds  they're completely crowded together  they're jammed  they're bashing up against each other. And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff  what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous  and I think that's exactly the wrong image for when you're trying to teach science. So  another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle. So a kid who's    in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem  which is a truly subtle and interesting proof  but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics. So a more direct one  one that gives you more of the feeling of math  is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof  which goes like this  so here we have this triangle  and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that  notice that we can move those triangles down like this. And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ... and bingo. That is all you have to do. And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the  literally        or       proofs of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered. Now let's go to young children. This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first grade teacher  but was a natural mathematician. So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician  she just had a feeling for math. And here are her six year olds  and she's got them making shapes out of a shape. So they pick a shape they like    like a diamond  or a square  or a triangle  or a trapezoid    and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape  and the next larger shape. You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project  and then something like science. So they had created these artifacts. Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious  which I thought for a long time  until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think. So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up. But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out.  What have you noticed about what you did   And so six year old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one  and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one  the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one  and then the next one. She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two  so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there. And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six  where she wasn't sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was  but then she was confident again. So that's what Lauren did. And then the teacher  Gillian Ishijima  had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor  and everybody went batshit   Holy shit  They're the same   No matter what the shapes were  the growth law is the same. And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete differential equation  derived by six year olds. Well  that's pretty amazing. That isn't what we usually try to teach six year olds. So  let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this. And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do. I'm using the software that we're putting on the      laptop. So I'd like to draw a little car here    I'll just do this very quickly    and put a big tire on him. And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object  I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior  car forward. Each time I click it  car turn. If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again  I just drag these guys out and set them going. And I can try steering the car here by ... See the car turn by five here  So what if I click this down to zero  It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine year olds. Make it go in the other direction. But of course  that's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car  so the kids want to do a steering wheel  so they draw a steering wheel. And we'll call this a wheel. See this wheel's heading here  If I turn this wheel  you can see that number over there going minus and positive. That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here  and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. And it's interesting. You know how much trouble the children have with variables  but by learning it this way  in a situated fashion  they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it. And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did. So if you look at the little script here  the speed is always going to be   . We're going to move the car according to that over and over again. And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things  they're evenly spaced because they're    apart. And what if I do this progression that the six year olds did of saying   OK  I'm going to increase the speed by two each time  and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time  What do I get there   We get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration. So how do the children do science  Student    Ooh  this is nice. Teacher  Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing. Who's got the apple  Alan Kay  They've got little stopwatches. Student    What did you get  What did you get  AK  Stopwatches aren't accurate enough. Student     .   seconds. Teacher  So put  sponge ball  ... Student  l   I decided to  do the shot put and the sponge ball because they're two totally different weights  and if you drop them at the same time  maybe they'll drop at the same speed. Teacher  Drop. Class  Whoa  AK  So obviously  Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because  of course  he didn't bother doing the experiment  and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas. And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child  only     years ago. We get one child like that about every classroom of    kids who will actually cut straight to the chase. Now  what if we want to look at this more closely  We can take a movie of what's going on  but even if we single stepped this movie  it's tricky to see what's going on. And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up. So when the children see this  they say   Ah  Acceleration   remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways  and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is. So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image  about a fifth of a second later  like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time  and if I stack these guys up  then we see the differences  the increase in the speed is constant. And they say   Oh  yeah. Constant acceleration. We've done that already.  And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it  So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there  but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time  we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model. Galileo  by the way  did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute. I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story  but it's a great story. And I thought I would do just one thing on the      laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here. So once you have gravity  here's this    increase the speed by something  increase the ship's speed. If I start the little game here that the kids have done  it'll crash the space ship. But if I oppose gravity  here we go ... Oops  One more. Yeah  there we go. Yeah  OK  I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes  Marshall McLuhan said   Children are the messages that we send to the future   but in fact  if you think of it  children are the future we send to the future. Forget about messages  children are the future  and children in the first and second world and  most especially  in the third world need mentors. And this summer  we're going to build five million of these      laptops  and maybe    million next year. But we couldn't create       new teachers this summer to save our life. That means that we  once again  have a thing where we can put technology out  but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing. I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface  and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about     million dollars. It sounds like a lot  but it is literally    minutes of what we're spending in Iraq    we're spending   billion dollars a month     minutes is     million dollars    so this is actually cheap. And Einstein said   Things should be as simple as possible  but not simpler.  Thank you. You know  I've talked about some of these projects before    about the human genome and what that might mean  and discovering new sets of genes. We're actually starting at a new point  we've been digitizing biology  and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. So  we've always been trying to ask big questions.  What is life   is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. We've tried various approaches  paring it down to minimal components. We've been digitizing it now for almost    years  when we sequenced the human genome  it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. Now we're trying to ask   Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe   This is the map of a small organism  Mycoplasma genitalium  that has the smallest genome for a species that can self replicate in the laboratory  and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. We're able to knock out on the order of     genes out of the     or so that are here. When we look at its metabolic map  it's relatively simple compared to ours    trust me  this is simple    but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time  it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. And so we started down the road of  can we synthesize a chromosome  Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before  And if we do  can we boot up a chromosome  A chromosome  by the way  is just a piece of inert chemical material. So  our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing  and our latest point would put it on  now  an exponential curve. We started this over    years ago. It took several stages  in fact  starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult. There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA       to    letters in length    and it's a degenerate process  so the longer you make the piece  the more errors there are. So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. And this was our first attempt  starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X   . It's a small virus that kills bacteria. We designed the pieces  went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about       letters. The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria  and the bacteria started to read this genetic code  made the viral particles. The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. They laughed more than you guys are.  Laughter  And so  we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. But we wanted to go much larger  we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome    it's over         letters of genetic code    so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. Design is critical  and if you're starting with digital information in the computer  that digital information has to be really accurate. When we first sequenced this genome in       the standard of accuracy was one error per        base pairs. We actually found  on resequencing it     errors  had we used that original sequence  it never would have been able to be booted up. Part of the design is designing pieces that are    letters long that have to overlap with all the other    letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. We design unique elements into this. You may have read that we put watermarks in. Think of this  we have a four letter genetic code    A  C  G and T. Triplets of those letters code for roughly    amino acids  such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids. So we can use the genetic code to write out words  sentences  thoughts. Initially  all we did was autograph it. Some people were disappointed there was not poetry. We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes  there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. And we started making pieces  starting with pieces that were       to       letters  put those together to make        letter pieces  then put sets of those going up to       . At each stage  we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. We're trying to get to the point of automation. So  this looks like a basketball playoff. When we get into these really large pieces over         base pairs  they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli    it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology    and so we turned to other mechanisms. We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. Here's an example of it  there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. You can see in the top panel  its chromosome just gets blown apart. Twelve to    hours later  it put it back together exactly as it was before. We have thousands of organisms that can do this. These organisms can be totally desiccated  they can live in a vacuum. I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space  move around  find a new aqueous environment. In fact  NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes  actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in  yeast puts them together automatically. This is not an electron micrograph  this is just a regular photomicrograph. It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope. These are pictures over about a six second period. So  this is the publication we had just a short while ago. This is over         letters of genetic code  it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. It's over     million molecular weight. If we printed it out at a    font with no spacing  it takes     pages just to print this genetic code. Well  how do we boot up a chromosome  How do we activate this  Obviously  with a virus it's pretty simple  it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves  you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one  and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. With bacteria and Archaea  the chromosome is integrated into the cell  but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. We purified a chromosome from one microbial species    roughly  these two are as distant as human and mice    we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome  we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins  and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell    and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. The new chromosome went into the cell. In fact  we thought this might be as far as it went  but we tried to design the process a little bit further. This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere  adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. So  people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA. The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one  the chromosome we put in does. It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material  chewed it up  and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. And with a very short period of time  all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. All the proteins changed  the membranes changed  when we read the genetic code  it's exactly what we had transferred in. So  this may sound like genomic alchemy  but we can  by moving the software of DNA around  change things quite dramatically. Now I've argued  this is not genesis  this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion  where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design. Why do this  I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs. We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next    years. To put it in context for myself  I was born in     . There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in       within    years  there'll be four. We have trouble feeding  providing fresh  clean water  medicines  fuel for the six and a half billion. It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. We use over five billion tons of coal     billion plus barrels of oil    that's a hundred million barrels a day. When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that  it's going to be a huge challenge. Then of course  there's all that CO  from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. We now  from our discovery around the world  have a database with about    million genes  and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components  and look at the diversity that came out of that. We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination. We now have techniques  because of these rapid methods of synthesis  to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. When you think of processing these    million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals  new vaccines  we can just with a small team  do more molecular biology than the last    years of all science. And it's just standard selection  we can select for viability  chemical or fuel production  vaccine production  etc. This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer. You know  we don't know necessarily what it'll look like  we know exactly what their genetic code looks like. We're focusing on now fourth generation fuels. You've seen recently  corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. We have second  and third generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar  to much higher value fuels like octane or different types of butanol. But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO  as its feedstock  and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. And we think we'll have the first fourth generation fuels in about    months. Sunlight and CO  is one method ... but in our discovery around the world  we have all kinds of other methods. This is an organism we described in     . It lives in the deep ocean  about a mile and a half deep  almost at boiling water temperatures. It takes CO  to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. We're looking to see if we can take captured CO   which can easily be piped to sites  convert that CO  back into fuel to drive this process. So  in a short period of time  we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of  What is life   We truly  you know  have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol chemical industry    Yeah. If you can't do that at TED  where can you     become a major source of energy ... But also  we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines. You've seen this year with flu  we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine. I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance. Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing  now  the evolutionary tree  speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria  Archaea and  eventually  eukaryotes. We're a ways away from improving people  our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. In this rather long sort of marathon presentation  I've tried to break it up into three parts  the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface. And these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of  if you will  the intelligence of interaction. Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies    new media falling very much into that mold. Again  I will go through them as fast as possible. And then the last one will be some examples I've been able to collect  which I think illustrate this at least as best I can  in the world of entertainment. People have this belief    and I share most of it    that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. But then you think   My God  What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV.  Well  it doesn't have to be terrible. And that is a slide taken from a TV set and it was pre processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium  and it absolutely looks beautiful. Well  what's happened  How did people get into this mess  Where you are now  all of a sudden  sitting in front of personal computers and video text    teletext systems  and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen  Well  you have to remember that TV was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal. So you get a    inch     inch  whatever  TV  and then you should multiply that by eight and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set. Now we've put people    inches in front of a TV  and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen  all of a sudden  are staring you in the face  the shadow mask  the scan lines  all of that. And they can be treated very easily  there are actually ways of getting rid of them  there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures. I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. Let me talk about how you might input information. And my favorite example is always fingers. I'm very interested in touch sensitive displays. High tech  high touch. Isn't that what some of you said  It's certainly a very important medium for input  and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low resolution sort of stylus for inputting to a display. In fact  they're not  it's really a very  very high resolution input medium    you have to just do it twice  you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly    and you can move a cursor with great accuracy. And so when you see on the market these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution  it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing. But it  in some sense  misses the point  namely  that fingers are a very  very high resolution input medium. Now  what are some of the other advantages  Well  the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up  and people don't realize how important that is    not having to pick up your fingers to use them.  Laughter  When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh    and I will not criticize the mouse too much    when you're typing    what you have    you want to now put something    first of all  you've got to find the mouse. You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt  but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse  and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen. And then when you finally see where it is  then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there  and then     Bang     you've got to hit a button or do whatever. That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it all in one motion    or one and a half  depending on how you want to count. Again  what I'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that I think face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems from the perspective of the quality of that interface. And another advantage  of course  of using fingers is you have    of them. And we have never known how to do this technically  so this slide is a fake slide. We never succeeded in using ten fingers  but there are certain things you can do  obviously  with more than one finger input  which is rather fascinating. What we did stumble across was something ... Again  which is typical of the computer field  is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature. And maybe ...  Laughter  maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug. But the bug in our case was in touch sensitive displays  we wanted to be able to draw    you know  rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points    and there was just too much friction created between your finger and the glass    if glass was the substrate  which it usually is. So we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display. And when you touch it with your finger  you can actually  then  introduce all the forces on the face of that screen  and that actually has a certain amount of value. Let me see if I can load another disc and show you  quickly  an example. Now  imagine a screen  which is not only touch sensitive now  it's pressure sensitive. And it's pressure sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen    X  Y  and Z at least in one direction  we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction. But let me get rid of the slide  and let's see if this comes on. OK. So there is the pressure sensitive display in operation. The person's just  if you will  pushing on the screen to make a curve. But this is the interesting part. I want to stop it for a second because the movie is very badly made. And the particular display was built about six years ago  and when we moved from one room to another room  a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed. So all we have is this record.  Laughter  But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object    one of N    like he did there  and then pushed on it. Now  imagine a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light  one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass. And when you touch it  you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen  and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen. And what you can do    oops  I didn't mean to do that    what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties. So again  they don't have to be weight  they could be a general trying to move troops  and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat. In fact  they funded it for that very reason. The whole notion  then  is one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer    in this case it's pressure and touches    that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before. So it's not simply looking at the quality or  if you will  the luxury of that interface  but it's actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before. I want to move on to another example  which is one of a different sort  where we're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book. Here  the idea is that you're going to take this book  if you will  and it's going to come alive. You're going to sort of breathe life into it. We are so used to doing monologues. Filmmakers  for example  are the experts in monologue making  you make a film and it has a well formed beginning  middle and end  and in some sense the art of it is that. And you then say   There's an opportunity for making conversational movies.  Well  what does that mean  And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium. So  book writing is the same thing. What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there  but you have to keep a few things in mind. One is that this book knows about itself. Each frame of the movie has information about itself. So it knows  or at least there is computer readable information in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame. That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium  and you can  in fact  branch and expand and elaborate and shrink. And here    again  my favorite example    is the cookbook  the  Larousse Gastronomique.  And I think I use the example all too often  but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little encyclopedia style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin  and you get to the end of the recipe and it says   Cook until done.  Now  that would be  if you will  the top green track  which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert  and say   Cook at     degrees for    minutes.  And then for a real beginner  you would go down even further and elaborate more    say   Open the oven  preheat  wait for the light to go out  open the door  don't leave it open too long  put the penguin in and shut the door ...   Laughter  whatever. And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back. That's one kind of use of random access. And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways. If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question  the last thing you do is repeat what you just said. You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing  or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style  then you might say it in a way that you think would have a good impedance match with that student. There are all sorts of techniques you will use    and again  this is a different kind of branching. So  what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book  but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission. Now  I don't even know what vintage the transmission is  but let me just show you very quickly some of it  and we'll move on. Nicholas Negroponte  Now  this is his table of contents. Just a picture of the transmission  and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts. Narrator  When I find a chapter that I want to see  I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read. The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words  so I can get a different definition by just touching the word  and the definition appears  superimposed over the illustration. NN  This is about the oil pan  or the oil filter and all that. This is relatively important because it sets the page ... Narrator  This is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red. I can get a definition of these words just by touching them  and the definition will appear in the illustration corner. I can get back to the illustration  but in this case it's not a single frame  but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair that's described in the text. The two headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie at various speeds  in forward or reverse. And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie. I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed. Here's another step by step procedure  only in this case    NN  Okay  this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound sync movies    this is text sync movies  so as the movie plays  the text gets highlighted. We highlight the text as we go through the movie. Repairman  ... Not too far out. Front poles  preferably. Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far  you'll have a big mess. NN  I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language. OK. I'm at the third and last part of this  which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment. And of course  good education has got to be good entertainment  so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment that we've been doing    in this case  in Senegal    where we have tried to use personal computers as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all  the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles    the child is  if you will  the teacher and the machine is the student    and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking. But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant. And there are just a few slides I want to go through  but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when  before we did this in any developing countries    we're doing it  in fact  in three developing countries right now  Pakistan  Colombia and Senegal    we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City. And one child  whose name I've forgotten  was about seven or eight years old  absolutely considered mentally handicapped    couldn't read  didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes    and was pretty much not in school  though physically there. But did hang around the  quote   computer room   where there were quite a few computers  and learned this particular language called Logo    and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun  it was very interesting. And one day  by chance  some visitors from the NIE came by in their double breasted suits looking at this setup  and none of the children who were normally there  except for this one child  were there. He was  and he said   Let me show you how this works   and they got an absolutely ingenuous  wonderful description of Logo. And the child was just zipping right through it  showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain and so he flipped through the manual  found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked. They were delighted  and by the time it was time to go see the principal  whom they'd actually come to see    not the computer room    they went upstairs and they said   This is absolutely remarkable  That child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic.  The principal said   There's a dreadful mistake  because that child can't read. And you obviously have been hoodwinked or you've talked about somebody else.  And they all got up and they all went downstairs and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent  they asked the child   Can you read   And the child said   No  I can't.  And then they said   But wait a minute. You just looked through that manual and you found ...   and he said   Oh  but that's not reading.  And so they said   Well  what's reading then   He says   Well  reading is this junk they give me in little books to read. It's absolutely irrelevant   Laughter  and I get nothing for it. But here  with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return.  And it really meant something to the child. The child read beautifully  it turned out  and was really very competent. So it actually meant something. And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar  but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there  and it is  when does it mean something to a child  There is a myth  and it truly is a myth  we believe    and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room    that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak. And it's not  but we think speech     My God  little children pick it up somehow  and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job  and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well. And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read  and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you. Hence  it must be harder.  Well  it's not harder. What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child  the child can get a great deal by talking to you. Reading and writing is utterly useless. There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith  and that it's going to help you.  Laughter  So what happens is you go to school and people say   Just believe me  you're going to like it. You're going to like reading   and just read and read. On the other hand  you give a kid    a three year old kid    a computer and they type a little command and    Poof     something happens. And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing  but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen has a huge payoff  and it's a lot of fun. And in fact  it's a powerful educational instrument. Well  in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom      kids    three per desk    one teacher  a little bit of chalk. This student was one of our first students  and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard  and she came ... within two days    I want to show you the program she wrote  and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made. That's what meant something to her  is doing the hair pattern  and actually did it within two days    an hour each day    and found it was  to her  absolutely the most meaningful piece ... But rooted in that  little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest. And again  I could talk for three hours about this subject. I will come to my last example and then quit. And my last example    as some of my former colleagues  whom I see in the room  can imagine what it will be. Yes  it is. It's our work    that was a while ago  and it still is my favorite project    of teleconferencing. And the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system where you had the following situation  you had five people at five different sites    they were known people    and you had to have these people in teleconference  such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present. Now  that is sufficiently zany that we would  obviously  jump to the bait  and we did. And the fact that we knew the people    we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney    we actually went so far as to build CRTs in the shapes of the people's faces. So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone  my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk  and that would be the TV used for the occasion. And it's uncanny  there's no way I can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face projected on a  D CRT of that sort. The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them that there needed to be spatial correspondence  which is straightforward  but again  it's something that didn't fall naturally out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking  it was a very  if you will  architectural or spatial concept. And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table  the actual location of the people becomes rather important. And when somebody gets up  in fact  to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something  the empty seat becomes  if you will  that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat and you say   He or she wouldn't agree   and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial. So we said   Well  these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same  so that at my site  I would be  if you will  real and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads. And the plastic heads  sometimes you want to project them. And there are a number of schemes  which I don't want to dwell on  but this is the one that we finally used where we projected onto rear screen material that was molded in the face    literally in the face of the person. And I'll show you one more slide  where this is actually made from something called a solid photograph and is the screen. Now  we track  on the person's head  the head motions    so we transmit with a video the head positions    and so this head moves in about two axes. So if I  all of a sudden  turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person  then at the person to my right's site  he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other. And then if that person interrupts  then those two heads may turn. And it really is reconstructing  quite accurately  teleconferencing. I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder  schizophrenia. And as a sister and later  as a scientist  I wanted to understand  why is it that I can take my dreams  I can connect them to my reality  and I can make my dreams come true  What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality  so they instead become delusion  So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston  where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes  in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab  we were asking the question   What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control  as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia  schizoaffective or bipolar disorder   So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain  which cells are communicating with which cells  with which chemicals  and then in what quantities of those chemicals  So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day  but then in the evenings and on the weekends  I traveled as an advocate for NAMI  the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December           I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours  I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage  I could not walk  talk  read  write or recall any of my life. I essentially became an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain  it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you a real human brain. So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain  the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down  and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain  it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers  our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor  while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor. The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum  which is made up of some     million axonal fibers. But other than that  the two hemispheres are completely separate. Because they process information differently  each of our hemispheres think about different things  they care about different things  and  dare I say  they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant  It has been. Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment. It's all about  right here  right now.  Our right hemisphere  it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies. Information  in the form of energy  streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like  what this present moment smells like and tastes like  what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere. We are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here  right now  we are brothers and sisters on this planet  here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect  we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere  our left hemisphere  is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details  and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes all that information  associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned  and projects into the future all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me   Hey  you've got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning.  It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important  it's that little voice that says to me   I am. I am.  And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me  I am   I become separate. I become a single solid individual  separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke  I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me    and then it released me. And then it just gripped me    and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain  so I thought   OK  I'll just start my normal routine.  So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider  which is a full body  full exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing  and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought   That's very peculiar.  And I looked down at my body and I thought   Whoa  I'm a weird looking thing.  And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality  where I'm the person on the machine having the experience  to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience. And it was all very peculiar  and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine  and I'm walking across my living room floor  and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace  and there's this constriction in my area of perception  so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower  and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying   OK. You muscles  you've got to contract. You muscles  you relax.  And then I lost my balance  and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin and where I end  because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect was this energy    energy. And I'm asking myself   What is wrong with me  What is going on   And in that moment  my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me. And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body  I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with all the energy that was  and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me   Hey  We've got a problem  We've got to get some help.  And I'm going   Ahh  I've got a problem   So it's like   OK  I've got a problem.  But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness    and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world. So here I am in this space  and my job  and any stress related to my job    it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those    they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine what it would feel like to lose    years of emotional baggage  euphoria. It was beautiful. And again  my left hemisphere comes online and it says   Hey  You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help.  And I'm thinking   I've got to get help. I've got to focus.  So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment  and I'm thinking   I've got to get to work. Can I drive   And in that moment  my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side. Then I realized   Oh my gosh  I'm having a stroke   And the next thing my brain says to me is  Wow  This is so cool  This is so cool  How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out   And then it crosses my mind   But I'm a very busy woman    I don't have time for a stroke   So I'm like   OK  I can't stop the stroke from happening  so I'll do this for a week or two  and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help. I've got to call work.  I couldn't remember the number at work  so I remembered  in my office I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room  I pull out a three inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like  I couldn't tell if this was my card or not  because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols  and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment  I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card... that's not the card. It took me    minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime  for    minutes  the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers  I do not understand the telephone  but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad and I put it right here. I take the business card  I put it right here  and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out into La La Land  and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them  so that as I would come back to normal reality  I'd be able to tell   Yes  I've already dialed that number.  Eventually  the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone  and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me   Woo woo woo woo.   Laughter  And I think to myself   Oh my gosh  he sounds like a Golden Retriever   And so I say to him    clear in my mind  I say to him   This is Jill  I need help   And what comes out of my voice is   Woo woo woo woo woo.  I'm thinking   Oh my gosh  I sound like a Golden Retriever.  So I couldn't know    I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help. And a little while later  I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to  Massachusetts  General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon with the last bit of air  just right out of the balloon  I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment  I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life  or this was perhaps my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon  I was shocked to discover that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender  I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality. Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire  and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise  and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position of my body in space  I felt enormous and expansive  like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit soared free  like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking  there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized   But I'm still alive  I'm still alive  and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive  then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana.  And I pictured a world filled with beautiful  peaceful  compassionate  loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres    and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be  what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage  the surgeons went in  and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama  who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years to completely recover. So who are we  We are the life force power of the universe  with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds. And we have the power to choose  moment by moment  who and how we want to be in the world. Right here  right now  I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere  where we are. I am the life force power of the universe. I am the life force power of the    trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form  at one with all that is. Or  I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere  where I become a single individual  a solid. Separate from the flow  separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor  intellectual  neuroanatomist. These are the  we  inside of me. Which would you choose  Which do you choose  And when  I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres  the more peace we will project into the world  and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea worth spreading. Thank you. I'm going to go right into the slides. And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff. And my ideas are    in my head  anyway    they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients. I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems  or I really do solve their problems  because usually they seem to like it. Let me go right into the slides. Can you turn off the light  Down. I like to be in the dark. I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here. Anyway  I did this house in Santa Monica  and it got a lot of notoriety. In fact  it appeared in a porno comic book  which is the slide on the right. This is in Venice. I just show it because I want you to know I'm concerned about context. On the left hand side  I had the context of those little houses  and I tried to build a building that fit into that context. When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird  and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space. And then  once I deal with the context  I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene  as I hope you'll find that slide on the right. And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A. I was concerned about making a place for the study of law. And we continue to work with this client. The building on the right at the top is now under construction. The garage on the right    the gray structure    will be torn down  finally  and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created  this campus. And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place. They wanted a sense of place. And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown  in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into. And it was my theory  or my point of view  that one didn't upstage the neighborhood    one made accommodations. I tried to be inclusive  to include the buildings in the neighborhood  whether they were buildings I liked or not. In the '  s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's. We even made flooring  walls and everything  out of cardboard. And the success of it threw me for a loop. I couldn't deal with the success of furniture    I wasn't secure enough as an architect    and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like. So  nobody would like this. And it was in this  preliminary to these pieces of furniture  that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice. And after we failed  I just kept failing. The piece on the left    and that ultimately led to the piece on the right    happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket. And I put a piece of tape around it  as you see there  and realized you could sit on it  and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on. So  it was an accidental discovery. I got into fish. I mean  the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism    at po mo    and said that fish were     million years earlier than man  and if you're going to go back  we might as well go back to the beginning. And so I started making these funny things. And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger    as the one glass at the Walker. And then  I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement. And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it    accidental  again    it was an intuitive kind of thing  and I just kept going with it  and made this proposal for a building  which was only a proposal. I did this building in Japan. I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed. And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff. And after I got    I was really drunk    I was asked to do some sketches on napkins. And I made some sketches on napkins    little boxes and Morandi like things that I used to do. And the client said   Why no fish   And so I made a drawing with a fish  and I left Japan. Three weeks later  I received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition. Now  it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form  because they're so beautiful    perfect    into a building or object like this. And Oldenburg  who I work with a little once in a while  told me I couldn't do it  and so that made it even more exciting. But he was right    I couldn't do the tail. I started to get the head OK  but the tail I couldn't do. It was pretty hard. The thing on the right is a snake form  a ziggurat. And I put them together  and you walk between them. It was a dialog with the context again. Now  if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record    they didn't show the context  so you would think   God  what a pushy guy this is.  But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant. Couldn't find it. So ... As for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about  I was thrown for a complete loop. This was built in six months. The way we sent drawings to Japan  we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models  and we used to make foam models  which that thing scanned. We made the drawings of the fish and the scales. And when I got there  everything was perfect    except the tail. So  I decided to cut off the head and the tail. And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker. And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made  I think. And then Jay Chiat  a friend and client  asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A. For reasons we don't want to talk about  it got delayed. Toxic waste  I guess  is the key clue to that one. And so we built a temporary building    I'm getting good at temporary    and we put a conference room in that's a fish. And  finally  Jay dragged me to my hometown  Toronto  Canada. And there is a story    it's a real story    about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday  bringing it home  putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid. I played with it in the evening. When I went to sleep  the next day it wasn't there. And the next night  we had gefilte fish. And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture. And he didn't buy a sculpture  so I made one. I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's  and I put the fish in. It was a joke. I play with funny people like  Claes  Oldenburg. We've been friends for a long time. And we've started to work on things. A few years ago  we did a performance piece in Venice  Italy  called  Il Corso del Coltello     the Swiss Army knife. And most of the imagery is    Claes'  but those two little boys are my sons  and they were Claes' assistants in the play. He was the Swiss Army knife. He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter  and I was Frankie P. Toronto. P for Palladio. Dressed up like the AT T building by Claes    with a fish hat. The highlight of the performance was at the end. This beautiful object  the Swiss Army knife  which I get credit for participating in. And I can tell you    it's totally an Oldenburg. I had nothing to do with it. The only thing I did was  I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal  because I love sailing. We made it into a sailing craft. I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing. I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture  when things are made in such great quantities  absorbed in such great quantities  and there's so much denial about them. People hate it. And I'm fascinated with that  which  like the paper furniture    it's one of those materials. And I'm always drawn to that. And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link  which nobody will forgive me for. But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School. And that chain link is really expensive. It's in perspective and everything. And then we did a camp together for children with cancer. And you can see  we started making a building together. Of course  the milk can is his. But we were trying to collide our ideas  to put objects next to each other. Like a Morandi    like the little bottles    composing them like a still life. And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together. Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice  and I started with this three piece thing  and you entered in the middle. And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle. And he pushed that. And one day I had a    oh  well  the other way. I had the binoculars from Claes  and I put them there  and I could never get rid of them after that. Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal. It made my building look sick. And it was this interaction between that kind of  up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting. It led to the building on the left. And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars  you know  leaving out the    what the hell. I use a lot of metal in my work  and I have a hard time connecting with the craft. The whole thing about my house  the whole use of rough carpentry and everything  was the frustration with the crafts available. I said   If I can't get the craft that I want  I'll use the craft I can get.  There were plenty of models for that  in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns  and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials. I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture. And it was all of one material  and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls. The metalworkers  for the most part  do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff. I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington  and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings  etc. etc. And it's working very well to have these people  these craftsmen  interested in it. I just tell the stories. It's a way of connecting  at least  with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture. The metal continued into a building    Herman Miller  in Sacramento. And it's just a complex of factory buildings. And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place    a people place. I mean  it's kind of a trite thing to say  but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be  where the people would come and where the people working would interact. So it's out in the middle of nowhere  and you approach it. It's copper and galvanize. I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge  so it would buckle. I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic. Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect  and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy. And they end up looking like stone. This is the central area. There's a ramp. And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman. Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job. And when I was awarded the contract I  at the very beginning  asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me. Because these were ideas that we were talking about  building things next to each other  making    it's all about  a  metaphor for a city  maybe. And so Stanley did the little dome thing. And we did it over the phone and by fax. He would send me a fax and show me something. He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower. I told him   No  no  that's too ongepotchket. I don't want the tower.  So he came back with a simpler building  but he put some funny details on it  and he moved it closer to my building. And so I decided to put him in a depression. I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in. And so then he put two bridges    this all happened on the fax  going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period. And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it. And so then I put this big billboard behind it. And I call it   David and Goliath.  And that's my cafeteria. In Boston  we had that old building on the left. It was a very prominent building off the freeway  and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of    I thought    the language of the neighborhood  which had these cornices  projecting cornices. Mine got a little exuberant  but I used lead copper  which is a beautiful material  and it turns green in     years. Instead of  like  copper in    or   . We redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space. And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved  because they have very strict kind of design guideline  and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them. The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building. In Barcelona  on Las Ramblas for some film festival  I did the Hollywood sign going and coming  made a building out of it  and they built it. I flew in one night and took this picture. But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me. And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica    a little shopping center. And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa  in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back. It's the support labs  which  by some coincidence  required no windows. And the shape fit perfectly. I just joined the points. In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment. That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase    a pipe canyon    and so it was an opportunity that I seized  because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form. It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it. This is a small house somewhere. They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is. It's in the West Valley. And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream    dammed it up to make a lake. These are the models. The reality  with the lake    the workmanship is pretty bad. And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house. When you have to do something really cheaply  it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff. That big metal thing is a passage  and in it is    you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom  which is on the right. It's kind of like a whole built town. I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale. I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that. This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota. The owners had a dilemma    they asked Philip to do it. He was too busy. He didn't recommend me  by the way. We ended up having to make it a sculpture  because the dilemma was  how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language  Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided  Etc. etc. You've got the idea. And so we finally ended up making it. These people are art collectors. And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side. And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it. It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin Ply    it's that formed lumber from Finland. We used it at Loyola on the chapel  and it didn't work. I keep trying to make it work. In this case we learned how to detail it. In Cleveland  there's Burnham Mall  on the left. It's never been finished. Going out to the lake  you can see all those new buildings we built. And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site. There's a railroad track. This is the city hall over here somewhere  and the courthouse. And the centerline of the mall goes out. Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built  and so we followed. Sohio is on the axis here  and we followed the axis  and they're two kind of goalposts. And this is our building  which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company. We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top  folded. The health club is fastened to the garage with a C clamp  for Cleveland. You drive down. So it's about a    story C clamp. And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum  and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry. This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries. And this would be a hotel. So  the centerline of this thing    we'd preserve it  and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox  etc.  that are underway. It's hard to do high rise. I feel much more comfortable down here. This is a piece of property in Brentwood. And a long time ago  about '   or something  after my house    I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard    and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left. And she came back  I guess wealthier or something    something happened    and asked me to design a house for her on this site. And following that basic idea of the village  we changed it as we got into it. I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end    here you see on the photographs of the site    slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall  creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom  which I designed like a kind of a barge  looking like a boat. And that's it  built. The dome was a request from the client. She wanted a dome somewhere in the house. She didn't care where. When you sleep in this bedroom  I hope    I mean  I haven't slept in it yet. I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there  but she said I didn't have to do that. But when you're in that room  you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake. And it's very private. The landscape is being built around to create a private garden. And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room  and one on the other side. These aren't focused very well. I don't know how to do it from here. Focus the one on the right. It's up there. Left    it's my right. Anyway  you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees. That's the living room. Servants' quarters. A guest bedroom  which has this dome with marble on it. And then you enter into the living room and then so on. This is the bedroom. You come down from this level along the stairway  and you enter the bedroom here  going into the lake. And the bed is back in this space  with windows looking out onto the lake. These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot. The material is lead copper  like in the building in Boston. And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land    it's     by        into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it. And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table. It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free. But the idea is  the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside. Eventually this will be screened    these trees will come up    and it will be very private. And you feel like you're in your own kind of village. This is for Michael Eisner    Disney. We're doing some work for him. And this is in Anaheim  California  and it's a freeway building. You go under this bridge at about    miles an hour  and there's another bridge here. And you're through this room in a split second  and the building will sort of reflect that. On the backside  it's much more humane    entrance  dining hall  etc. And then this thing here    I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it. Kind of a fun thing to do. I'm doing a building in Switzerland  Basel  which is an office building for a furniture company. And we struggled with the image. These are the early studies  but they have to sell furniture to normal people  so if I did the building and it was too fancy  then people might say   Well  the furniture looks OK in his thing  but no  it ain't going to look good in my normal building.  So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here  and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate. And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces. This is in Paris  along the Seine. Palais des Sports  the Gare de Lyon over here. The Minister of Finance    the guy that moved from the Louvre    goes in here. There's a new library across the river. And back in here  in this already treed park  we're doing a very dense building called the American Center  which has a theater  apartments  dance school  an art museum  restaurants and all kinds of    it's a very dense program    bookstores  etc. In a very tight  small    this is the ground level. And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off. They call it the plan coupe. And I struggled with that thing    how to get around the corner. These are the models for it. I showed you the other model  the one    this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing    so I understood the problem. I was trying to get around this plan coupe    how do you do it  Apartments  etc. And these are the kind of study models we did. And the one on the left is pretty awful. You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built. But out of it came finally this resolution  where the elevator piece worked frontally to this  parallel to this street  and also parallel to here. And then this kind of twist  with this balcony and the skirt  kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer. The restaurants here    the apartments and the theater  etc. So it would all be built in stone  in French limestone  except for this metal piece. And it faces into a park. And the idea was to make this express the energy of this. On the side facing the street it's much more normal  except I slipped a few mansards down  so that coming on the point  these housing units made a gesture to the corner. And this will be some kind of high tech billboard. If any of you guys have any ideas for it  please contact me. I don't know what to do. Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment  and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons. And it's got a fish. And I keep thinking   This is going to be the last fish.  It's like a drug addict. I say   I'm not going to do it anymore    I don't want to do it anymore    I'm not going to do it.  And then I do it. There it is. But it's the living room. And this piece here is    I don't know what it is. I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out. This is Euro Disney  and I've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier. We've had a lot of fun working together. I think I'm from Mars for them  and they are for me  but somehow we all manage to work together  and I think  productively. So far. This is a shopping thing. You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here. And then this is a kind of a shopping mall  with a rodeo and restaurants. And another restaurant. What I did    because of the Paris skies being quite dull  I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station  to the route of the train. It looks like it's kind of been there  and then crashed all these simpler forms into it. The light grid will have a light  be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling. In Switzerland    Germany  actually    on the Rhine across from Basel  we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum. And I tried to    there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here  there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here    I tried to make a relationship urbanistically. And I don't gave good slides to show    it's just been completed    but this piece here is this building  and these pieces here and here. And as you pass by it's always part    you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood. It's plaster and just zinc. And you wonder  if this is a museum  what it's going to be like inside  If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything  and just wait. I'm so cunning and clever    I made it quiet and wonderful. But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit. It's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff. And from the building in the back  you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills. I know I'm over time. See  that skylight goes down and becomes that one. So it's pretty quiet inside. This is the Disney Hall    the concert hall. It's a complicated project. It has a chamber hall. It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring. And it's not a great building  but I approached it optimistically  that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us. And the plan of this    it's a concert hall. This is the foyer  which is kind of a garden structure. There's commercial at the ground floor. These are offices  which  really  in the competition  we didn't have to design. But finally  there's a hotel there. These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler  composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed    to MOCA  etc. The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria  which led to this compartmentalized scheme  which we found out after the competition would not work at all. But everybody liked these forms and liked the space  and so that's one of the problems of a competition. You have to then try and get that back in some way. And we studied many models. This was our original model. These were the three buildings that were the ideal    the Concertgebouw  Boston and Berlin. Everybody liked the surround. Actually  this is the smallest hall in size  and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies. Our client doesn't want balconies  so    and when we met our new acoustician  he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape. And we tried many shapes  trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical  acceptable format. We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls  which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't  but now we have them. And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room. That's the idea. And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural. And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit  and create intimacy. Now  this is not a final design    these are just on the way to being    and so I wouldn't take it literally  except the feeling of the space. We studied the acoustics with laser stuff  and they bounce them off this and see where it all works. But you get the sense of the hall in section. Most halls come straight down into a proscenium. In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners. And so it will be quite a different shape. The original building  because it was frog like  fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well. When you get into a box  it's harder to do it    and here we are  struggling with how to put the hotel in. And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi. I just stuck it on there. But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away. And of course it's not going to look like that  but it is the crazy way I tend to work. And then finally  in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower  the highest building in L.A. Larry Halprin is doing the stairs. And I was asked to do a fish  and so I did a snake. It's a public space  and I made it kind of a garden structure  and you can go in it. It's a kiva  and Larry's putting some water in there  and it works much better than a fish. In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish  and we're working on that  at the foot of a Ritz Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore  Owings and Merrill. And the Ritz Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel  non fire proof  much like those old gas tanks. And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it  perverted it  into the form of the fish  and created a kind of a   th century contraption that looks like  that will sit    this is the beach and the harbor out in front  and this is really a shopping center with department stores. And we split these bridges. Originally  this was all solid with a hole in it. We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel. We showed this to the hotel people the other day  and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz Carlton anymore  because of this fish. And finally  I just threw these in    Lou Danziger. I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here  but this is a building I did for him in       I think. A little studio    and it's sadly for sale. Time goes on. And this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing. He designed the robot as the cashier  and the head moves  and I did the rest of it. And the food wasn't as good as the stuff  and so it failed. It should have been the other way around    the food should have been good first. It didn't work. Thank you very much. Thank you so much everyone from TED  and Chris and Amy in particular. I cannot believe I'm here. I have not slept in weeks. Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous    and I do this when I'm nervous  I just realized.  Laughter  So  I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called     Valencia  and then I'm going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things. Back in about       I was living in Brooklyn  I was trying to finish my first book  I was wandering around dazed every day because I wrote from    a.m. to   a.m. So I would walk around in a daze during the day. I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day  but I had flexible hours. In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in  Park Slope  there are a lot of writers    it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people. Meanwhile  I had grown up around a lot of teachers. My mom was a teacher  my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching. And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were  and they were really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspiring people I knew. But I knew so many of the things they were up against  so many of the struggles they were dealing with. And one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level  in their reading and writing in particular. Now  so many of these students had come from households where English isn't spoken in the home  where a lot of them have different special needs  learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools which sometimes and very often are under funded. And so they would talk to me about this and say   You know  what we really need is just more people  more bodies  more one on one attention  more hours  more expertise from people that have skills in English and can work with these students one on one.  Now  I would say   Well  why don't you just work with them one on one   And they would say   Well  we have five classes of    to    students each. This can lead up to               students a day. How can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one on one attention   You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers. And so we started talking about this. And at the same time  I thought about this massive group of people I knew  writers  editors  journalists  graduate students  assistant professors  you name it. All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word    I hope to have an interest in the English language  but I'm not speaking it well right now.  Laughter  I'm trying. That clock has got me. But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy  nurturing an enlightened life. And so they had  you know  their time and their interest  but at the same time there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community to bring these two communities together. So when I moved back to San Francisco  we rented this building. And the idea was to put McSweeney's    McSweeney's Quarterly  that we published twice or three times a year  and a few other magazines    we were going to move it into an office for the first time. It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn. We were going to move it into an office  and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center. So we thought   We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody    sort of a writing community    coming into the office every day anyway  why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school  get extra help on their written homework  so you have basically no border between these two communities   So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on  at      p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing  or you trade  or you work a little bit later or whatever it is. You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood. So  we had this place  we rented it  the landlord was all for it. We did this mural  that's a Chris Ware mural  that basically explains the entire history of the printed word  in mural form    it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road. So we rented this space. And everything was great except the landlord said   Well  the space is zoned for retail  you have to come up with something. You've gotta sell something. You can't just have a tutoring center.  So we thought   Ha ha  Really   And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell  but we did all the necessary research. It used to be a weight room  so there were rubber floors below  acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights. We took all that down  and we found beautiful wooden floors  whitewashed beams and it had the look    while we were renovating this place  somebody said   You know  it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship.  And we looked around and somebody else said   Well  you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer.   Laughter  And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh  and we said   There's a point to that. Let's sell pirate supplies.  This is the pirate supply store. You see  this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin. A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see  we made it look sort of pirate supply like. Here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy. We have the peg legs there  that are all handmade and fitted to you. Up at the top  you see the eyepatch display  which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch  and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night    special occasions  bar mitzvahs and whatever. So we opened this place. And this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in. This is replacement eyes in case you lose one. These are some signs that we have all over the place   Practical Joking with Pirates.  While you're reading the sign  we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head. That was just my one thing    I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads. It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater  which is just a saltwater tank with three seats  and then right behind it we set up this space  which was the tutoring center. So right there is the tutoring center  and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices  where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that. The kids would come in    or we thought they would come in. I should back up. We set the place up  we opened up  we spent months and months renovating this place. We had tables  chairs  computers  everything. I went to a dot com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto and I bought    G s with a stroke of a paddle. Anyway  we bought 'em  we set everything up and then we waited. It was started with about    of my friends  people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood. And we sat. And at      p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said   Free Tutoring for Your English Related and Writing Related Needs    Just Come In  It's All Free.  And we thought   Oh  they're going to storm the gates  they're gonna love it.  And they didn't. And so we waited  we sat at the tables  we waited and waited. And everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited  really  where nobody came in. And then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap  because we were operating behind a pirate supply store.  Laughter  We never put it together  you know  And so then  around that time  I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari  a longtime San Francisco educator    she was teaching in Mexico City  she had all the experience necessary  knew everything about education  was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood    I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching. She took over as executive director. Immediately  she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything  and so suddenly it was actually full every day. And what we were trying to offer every day was one on one attention. The goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students. You know  it's been proven that    to    hours a year with one on one attention  a student can get one grade level higher. And so most of these students  English is not spoken in the home. They come there  many times their parents    you can't see it  but there's a church pew that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there    the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored. So that was the basis of it  was one on one attention. And we found ourselves full every day with kids. If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around   p.m.       p.m.  you will get run over  often  by the kids and their big backpacks  or whatever  actually running to this space  which is very strange  because it's school  in a way. But there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different. And the other thing was  there was no stigma. Kids weren't going into the  Center for Kids That Need More Help   or something like that. It was     Valencia. First of all  it was a pirate supply store  which is insane. And then secondly  there's a publishing company in the back. And so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often  and shoulder to shoulder  computer next to computer with the students. And so it became a tutoring center    publishing center  is what we called it    and a writing center. They go in  and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel    because we had very gifted kids  too. So there's no stigma. They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor. They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior. These adults  they're working in their field. They can lean over  ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other. There's a lot of cross pollination. The only problem  especially for the adults working at McSweeney's who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up  was that there was just the one bathroom.  Laughter  With like    kids a day  this is a problem. But you know  there's something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day  working one on one  getting all this attention    they go home  they're finished. They don't stall. They don't do their homework in front of the TV. They're allowed to go home at      p.m.  enjoy their family  enjoy other hobbies  get outside  play. And that makes a happy family. A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community. A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world. So the key to it all is homework   Laughter   Applause  There you have it  you know    one on one attention. So we started off with about    volunteers  and then we had about     and then a couple hundred. And we now have       volunteers on our roster. And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer. The key thing is  even if you only have a couple of hours a month  those two hours shoulder to shoulder  next to one student  concentrated attention  shining this beam of light on their work  on their thoughts and their self expression  is going to be absolutely transformative  because so many of the students have not had that ever before. So we said   Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months  it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough.  So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast. Then we said   Well  what are we going to do with the space during the day  because it has to be used before      p.m.   So we started bringing in classes during the day. So every day  there's a field trip where they together create a book    you can see it being typed up above. This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing. You just point a camera at a class  and it always looks like this. So this is one of the books that they do. Notice the title of the book   The Book That Was Never Checked Out  Titanic.  And the first line of that book is   Once there was a book named Cindy that was about the Titanic.  So  meanwhile  there's an adult in the back typing this up  taking it completely seriously  which blows their mind. So then we still had more tutors to use. This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events. The teachers that we work with    and everything is different to teachers    they tell us what to do. We went in there thinking   We're ultimately  completely malleable. You're going to tell us. The neighborhood's going to tell us  the parents are going to tell us. The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful.  So then they said   Why don't you come into the schools  Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you  necessarily  who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in  or aren't close enough   So then we started saying   Well  we've got       people on our tutor roster. Let's just put out the word.  A teacher will say   I need    tutors for the next five Sundays. We're working on our college essays. Send them in.  So we put that out on the wire        tutors. Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class. The teacher tells them what to do  how to do it  what their training is  what their project is so far. They work under the teacher's guide  and it's all in one big room. And that's actually the brunt of what we do is  people going straight from their workplace  straight from home  straight into the classroom and working directly with the students. So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students. Then another school said   Well  what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day   So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room  where we decorated it in buccaneer style. It's right off the library. And there we serve all     kids in this middle school. This is their newspaper  the  Straight Up News   that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom in both languages    English and Spanish. So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said   Hey  why don't you assign a book with high school students  I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world.  And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School  which is a school that we had worked with on some other things  and we gave that assignment to the students. And we said   Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end. She's going to publish them in a book. She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form. It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area and throughout the world  on Amazon and you name it.  So these kids worked harder than they've ever worked on anything in their lives  because there was that outside audience  there was Isabel Allende on the other end. I think we had about     tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well. We had a big party at the end. This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these. You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one   I Might Get Somewhere.  And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books. Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing. The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life if they know it's going to be permanent  know it's going to be on a shelf  know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said  that we've honored their words  honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts  six drafts    all this attention that we give to their thoughts. And once they achieve that level  once they've written at that level  they can never go back. It's absolutely transformative. And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks. We sell all the student books. Where else would you put them  right  So we sell 'em  and then something weird had been happening with the stores. The store  actually    even though we started out as just a gag    the store actually made money. So it was paying the rent. And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing    I don't know  I don't want to judge. But people would come in    and this was before the pirate movies and everything  It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money  but it was paying the rent  paying a full time staff member there. There's the ocean maps you can see on the left. And it became a gateway to the community. People would come in and say   What the     What is this   I don't want to swear on the web.  Laughter  Is that a rule  I don't know. They would say   What is this   And people would come in and learn more about it. And then right beyond    there's usually a little chain there    right beyond  they would see the kids being tutored. This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping  and they might be more likely to buy some lard  or millet for their parrot  or  you know  a hook  or hook protector for nighttime  all of these things we sell. So the store actually did really well. But it brought in so many people    teachers  donors  volunteers  everybody    because it was street level. It was open to the public. It wasn't a non profit buried  you know  on the   th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving  and it was open all the time to the public. So  it became this sort of weird  happy accident. So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn  they said   Well  why don't we have a place like that here   And a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators  so they combined with a lot of local designers  local writers  and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing. They didn't want to sell pirate supplies. They didn't think that that was going to work there. So  knowing the crime fighting community in New York  they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company. This is Sam Potts' great design that did this. And this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmith's shops that has to have every service they've ever offered  you know  all over there. So they opened this place. Inside  it's like a Costco for superheroes    all the supplies in kind of basic form. These are all handmade. These are all sort of repurposed other products  or whatever. All the packaging is done by Sam Potts. So then you have the villain containment unit  where kids put their parents. You have the office. This is a little vault    you have to put your product in there  it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism  which you do  if you want to buy anything. And it limits  really  their sales. Personally  I think it's a problem. Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything. These are some of the products. These are all handmade. This is a secret identity kit. If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone  one American female marketing executive from Hoboken  New Jersey. It's a full dossier on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone. So  this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape  and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action. There's nothing worse than  you know  getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that. So then  the secret door    this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in  but it slowly opens. You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks. It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back.  Applause  So you can see the full effect  But this is    I just want to emphasize    locally funded  locally built. All the designers  all of the builders  everybody was local  all the time was pro bono. I just came and visited and said   Yes  you guys are doing great   or whatever. That was it. You can see the time in all five boroughs of New York in the back.  Laughter   Applause  So this is the space during tutoring hours. It's very busy. Same principles  one on one attention  complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas. And this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those    feet of this bizarre store  right  So it's school  but it's not school. It's clearly not school  even though they're working shoulder to shoulder on tables  pencils and papers  whatever. This is one of the students  Khaled Hamdan. You can read this quote. Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home. Came in. Got this concentrated attention. And he couldn't escape it. So  soon enough  he was writing. He would finish his homework early    got really addicted to finishing his homework early. It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it  and to have it checked  and to know he's going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day. So he got hooked on that  and then he started doing other things. He's now been published in five books. He co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called  Super Has Beens.  He wrote a series on  Penguin Balboa   which is a fighting    a boxing    penguin. And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to     people at Symphony Space  at a benefit for     New York. So he's there every day. He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now. There's four family members that come in every day. So  I'll go through really quickly. This is L.A.  The Echo Park Time Travel Mart   Whenever You Are  We're Already Then.   Laughter  This is sort of a   Eleven for time travelers. So you see everything  it's exactly as a   Eleven would be. Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine   Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday.   Laughter   Applause  Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead. These are spaces that are only affiliated with us  doing this same thing  Word St. in Pittsfield  Massachusetts  Ink Spot in Cincinnati  Youth Speaks  San Francisco  California  which inspired us  Studio St. Louis in St. Louis  Austin Bat Cave in Austin  Fighting Words in Dublin  Ireland  started by Roddy Doyle  this will be open in April. Now I'm going to the TED Wish    is that okay  All right  I've got a minute. So  the TED Wish  I wish that you    you personally and every creative individual and organization you know    will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved  so that within a year we have a thousand examples    a thousand     of transformative partnerships. Profound leaps forward  And these can be things that maybe you're already doing. I know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things. I know that for a fact. So  tell us these stories and inspire others on the website. We created a website. I'm going to switch to  we   and not  I   hope  We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools. We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community. Always let the teachers lead the way. They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out. There are a million ways. You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help. So  this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco  they did this phenomenal job. This website is already up  it's already got a bunch of stories  a lot of ideas. It's called  Once Upon a School   which is a great title  I think. This site will document every story  every project that comes out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website  you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started. Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So  visit the site. If you have any questions  you can ask this guy  who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone. You email him  he'll answer any question you possibly want. And he'll get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change. And it can be fun  That's the point of this talk    it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable. You can do and use the skills that you have. The schools need you. The teachers need you. Students and parents need you. They need your actual person  your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion  sitting next to them  listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time. Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are  how smart and how much they have to say. You can tell them. You can shine that light on them  one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us. Thank you so much. Well  this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world. And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today. And I'm also rather surprised  because when I look back on my life the last thing I ever wanted to do was write  or be in any way involved in religion. After I left my convent  I'd finished with religion  frankly. I thought that was it. And for    years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor. And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer  particularly. But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes  one after the other  and finally found myself in television.  Laughter  I said that to Bill Moyers  and he said   Oh  we take anybody.   Laughter  And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs. This went down very well in the U.K.  where religion is extremely unpopular. And so  for once  for the only time in my life  I was finally in the mainstream. But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity. And there  for the first time  I encountered the other religious traditions  Judaism and Islam  the sister religions of Christianity. And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all    despite my own intensely religious background  I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity  and I knew nothing about Islam at all. But in that city  that tortured city  where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together  you also become aware of the profound connection between them. And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be  and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different light. And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me. Frankly  in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion  I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible. These doctrines seemed unproven  abstract. And to my astonishment  when I began seriously studying other traditions  I began to realize that belief    which we make such a fuss about today    is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the West  in about the   th century. The word  belief  itself originally meant to love  to prize  to hold dear. In the   th century  it narrowed its focus  for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment  to include    to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions  a credo.  I believe   it did not mean   I accept certain creedal articles of faith.  It meant   I commit myself. I engage myself.  Indeed  some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy. In the Quran  religious opinion    religious orthodoxy    is dismissed as  zanna   self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other  but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian.  Laughter  So if religion is not about believing things  what is it about  What I've found  across the board  is that religion is about behaving differently. Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God  first you do something. You behave in a committed way  and then you begin to understand the truths of religion. And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action  you only understand them when you put them into practice. Now  pride of place in this practice is given to compassion. And it is an arresting fact that right across the board  in every single one of the major world faiths  compassion    the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening    is not only the test of any true religiosity  it is also what will bring us into the presence of what Jews  Christians and Muslims call  God  or the  Divine.  It is compassion  says the Buddha  which brings you to Nirvana. Why  Because in compassion  when we feel with the other  we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there. And once we get rid of ego  then we're ready to see the Divine. And in particular  every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted    has said    and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule. First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ   Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you.  That  he said  was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day. And it was    the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called  ren   human heartedness  which was a transcendent experience in itself. And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms  too. There's a famous story about the great rabbi  Hillel  the older contemporary of Jesus. A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg. Hillel stood on one leg and said   That which is hateful to you  do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary. Go and study it.   Laughter  And  go and study it  was what he meant. He said   In your exegesis  you must make it clear that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary  a gloss upon the Golden Rule.  The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which led to hatred and disdain  or contempt of other people    any people whatsoever    was illegitimate. Saint Augustine made exactly the same point. Scripture  he says   teaches nothing but charity  and we must not leave an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it.  And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life.  Applause  But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is    where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities. Where instead of taking Jesus' words   Love your enemies. Don't judge others   we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people  endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people  putting other people down. Throughout the ages  religion has been used to oppress others  and this is because of human ego  human greed. We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things. So the traditions also insisted    and this is an important point  I think    that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group  your own nation  your own co religionists  your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called  jian ai   concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger. We formed you  says the Quran  into tribes and nations so that you may know one another. And this  again    this universal outreach    is getting subdued in the strident use of religion    abuse of religion    for nefarious gains. Now  I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who  when I say to them what I do for a living  inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong. The causes of our present woes are political. But  make no mistake about it  religion is a kind of fault line  and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region  religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent. Between      and          million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict. And so many of our institutions  even football  which used to be a pleasant pastime  now causes riots where people even die. And it's not surprising that religion  too  has been affected by this violent ethos. There's also a great deal  I think  of religious illiteracy around. People seem to think  now equate religious faith with believing things. As though that    we call religious people often believers  as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often  secondary goals get pushed into the first place  in place of compassion and the Golden Rule. Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes    when I'm speaking to congregations about compassion  I sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right  rather than compassionate.  Laughter  Now    but that's not the whole story. Since September the   th  when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me into public life  in a way that I'd never imagined  I've been able to sort of go all over the world  and finding  everywhere I go  a yearning for change. I've just come back from Pakistan  where literally thousands of people came to my lectures  because they were yearning  first of all  to hear a friendly Western voice. And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me    the young people were saying   What can we do  What can we do to change things   And my hosts in Pakistan said   Look  don't be too polite to us. Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing.  Because it seems to me that with    our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time. And religion  with its wide following ... Here in the United States  people may be being religious in a different way  as a report has just shown    but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism  which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old fashioned. But people want to be religious  and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world  which it can and should be    because of the Golden Rule.  Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you   an ethos that should now be applied globally. We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves. And these    whatever our wretched beliefs    is a religious matter  it's a spiritual matter. It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all. And as I say  there is a hunger for change out there. Here in the United States  I think you see it in this election campaign  a longing for change. And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the   th  coming together locally to create networks of understanding. With the mosque  with the synagogue  saying   We must start to speak to one another.  I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other. I'd    there's one story I'd just like to mention. This comes from  The Iliad.  But it tells you what this spirituality should be. You know the story of  The Iliad   the    year war between Greece and Troy. In one incident  Achilles  the famous warrior of Greece  takes his troops out of the war  and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle  his beloved friend  Patroclus  is killed    and killed in single combat by one of the Trojan princes  Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge  and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector  he mutilates his body and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family  which means that  in Greek ethos  Hector's soul will wander eternally  lost. And then one night  Priam  king of Troy  an old man  comes into the Greek camp incognito  makes his way to Achilles' tent to ask for the body of his son. And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself. And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep. And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons  and he  too  starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house. The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people. And then Achilles takes the body of Hector  he hands it very tenderly to the father  and the two men look at each other  and see each other as divine. That is the ethos found  too  in all the religions. It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies  and beginning to appreciate the other. It's of great importance that the word for  holy  in Hebrew  applied to God  is  Kadosh   separate  other. And it is often  perhaps  the very otherness of our enemies which can give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God. And now  here's my wish  I wish that you would help with the creation  launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion  crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism  Christianity and Islam  and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule. We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels    you probably meet  too    who want to join up  in some way  and reclaim their faith  which they feel  as I say  has been hijacked. We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos  and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document. I'd like to see it    to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures  these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity. Let's get back to that. And the idea  too  of Jews  Christians and Muslims    these traditions now so often at loggerheads    working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand  at least  of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world. And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar. Despite the idea that I love a good time  which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me    I actually spend a great deal of time alone  studying  and I'm not very    you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody  everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks  and Archbishop Desmond Tutu  for example  is very happy to give his name to this  as is Imam Feisal Rauf  the Imam in New York City. Also  I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations. I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations  which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism  and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism. And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it. The importance of this is that this is    I can see some of you starting to look worried  because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body    but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality  so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative  but that it's coming  as it were  from the United Nations  from the world    who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this. And so I do urge you to join me in making    in this charter    to building this charter  launching it and propagating it so that it becomes    I'd like to see it in every college  every church  every mosque  every synagogue in the world  so that people can look at their tradition  reclaim it  and make religion a source of peace in the world  which it can and should be. Thank you very much.  Applause  It was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life. Because  basically  I work as a theoretical physicist. I develop and test models of the Big Bang  using observational data. And I've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in Africa. And  I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge. People wonder  you know   How do you have time to do this   And so on. And so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides. So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life. Well  I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime. When they were released  we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania. Both were very young countries then  and full of hope for the future. We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money  but we were outdoors most of the time. We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world  like Kilimanjaro  Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge. Well  then we moved to London for high school. And after that    there's nothing much to say about that. It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa at the age of     as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho  which is a tiny country  surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa. Well     percent of the men in Lesotho worked in the mines over the border  in brutal conditions. Nevertheless  I    as I'm sure    as a rather irritating young  white man coming into their village  I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth. But the kids were the best part. The kids were amazing  extremely eager and often very bright. And I'm just going to tell you one story  which got through to me. I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible  to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world. And they weren't used to that. But I took them outside one day and I said   I want you to estimate the height of the building.  And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall  size it up with a finger  and make an estimate of the height. But there was one little boy  very small for his age. He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village. And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement. And so  I said    I was annoyed    I said   What are you doing  I want you to estimate the height of the building.  He said   OK. I measured the height of a brick. I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying.  Well     Laughter     I hadn't thought of that one. And many experiences like this happened to me. Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three month leave from the mines. Sitting next to him one day  he said   There's only one thing that I really loved at school. And you know what it was  Shakespeare.  And he recited some to me. And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa    inventive kids  intellectual kids    and starved of opportunity. And if Africa is going to get fixed  it's by them  not by us. Well  after     Applause     that's the truth. Well  after Lesotho  I traveled across Africa before returning to England    so gray and depressing  in comparison. And I went to Cambridge. And there  I fell for theoretical physics. Well  I'm not going to explain this equation  but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject. We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line. And  admittedly  it's in a very shorthand notation. And it contains    free parameters  OK  which we have to fit to the data. So it's not the final story  but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level. And apart from a few very important loose ends  which you've heard about here    like dark energy and dark matter    this equation describes  seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it. But there's one big puzzle remaining  and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in Tanzania  who's a wonderful Scottish lady who I still stay in touch with. And she's now in her   s. And when I try to explain my work to her  she waved away all the details  and she said   Neil  there's only one question that really matters. What banged    Laughter   Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged   And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding. The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence  full of a strange kind of energy    inflationary energy    which blew it up. But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved. Now  I worked on that theory for a while  with Stephen Hawking and others. But then I began to explore another alternative. The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning. Perhaps the universe existed before the bang  and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe. Well  this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories  the unified theories  which try to explain all those    free parameters in a single framework  which will hopefully predict all of them. And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here. It's all I can convey. According to these theories  there are extra dimensions of space  not just the three we're familiar with  but at every point in the room there are more dimensions. And in particular  there's one rather strange one  in the most elegant unified theories we have. The strange one looks likes this  that we live in a three dimensional world. We live in one of these worlds  and I can only show it as a sheet  but it's really three dimensional. And a tiny distance away  there's another sheet  also three dimensional  and they're separated by a gap. The gap is very tiny  and I've blown it up so you can see it. But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus. I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this  but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know. Well  I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question. Which is  what happens if these two  three dimensional worlds should actually collide  And if they collide  it would look a lot like the Big Bang. But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture. The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point. Everything comes out of a point  you have infinite density. And all the equations break down. No hope of describing that. In this picture  you'll notice  the bang is extended. It's not a point. The density of matter is finite  and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process. So  to cut a long story short  we've explored this alternative. We've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies  the fluctuations in the microwave background. Furthermore  there's an experimental way to tell this theory  apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before. It involves gravitational waves. And in this scenario  not only was the Big Bang not the beginning  as you can see from the picture  it can happen over and over again. It may be that we live in an endless universe  both in space and in time. And there've been bangs in the past  and there will be bangs in the future. And maybe we live in an endless universe. Well  making and testing models of the universe is  for me  the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe. We need to make the best mathematical models we can  the most consistent ones. And then we scrutinize them  logically and with data. And we try to convince ourselves    we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong. That's progress  when we prove things wrong. And gradually  we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world. As I pursued my career  something was always gnawing away inside me. What about Africa  What about those kids I'd left behind  Instead of developing  as we'd all hoped in the '  s  things had gotten worse. Africa was gripped by poverty  disease and war. This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project. And so the idea is to represent each country on a map  but scale the area according to some quantity. So here's just the standard area map of the world. By the way  Africa is very large. And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in       around the time of independence for many African states. Now  this is       and then     . And here's a projection for     . Big changes are happening in the world  but they're not helping Africa. What about Africa's population  The population isn't out of proportion to its area  but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes  malnutrition  simple infections and birth complications. Then there's HIV AIDS. And then there are deaths from war. OK  currently there are        people a month dying in the Congo  as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things. It's still going on. What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems  Well  here's the number of physicians in Africa. Here's the number of people in higher education. And here    most shocking to me    the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa. It just doesn't exist scientifically. And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa  that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet. Well  the transition to democracy in South Africa in      was literally a dream come true for many of us. My parents were both elected to the first parliament  alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple. And in       I took a research leave to visit them. And while I was busy working    I was working on these colliding worlds  in the day. But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills  especially mathematical skills  in industry  in government  in education. The ability to make and test models has become essential  not only to every single area of science today  but also to modern society itself. And if you don't have math  you're not going to enter the modern age. So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple. The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences  or AIMS. And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa  bring them together with lecturers from all over the world  and we'll try to give them a fantastic education. Well  as a Cambridge professor  I had many contacts. And to my astonishment  they backed me     percent. They said   Go and do it  and we'll come and lecture.  And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries    where they don't have any opportunities    together with the best lecturers in the world    who I knew would come  because of the interest in Africa    and put them together and just let the sparks fly. So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town. It's an    room Art Deco hotel from the     s. The area was kind of seedy  so we got an    room hotel for         dollars. It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word  we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel. Well  the new South Africa is a very exciting country. And those of you who haven't been there  you should go. It's very  very interesting what's happening. And we recruited wonderful staff  highly motivated staff. The other thing that's happened  which was good for us  is the Internet. Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa  there are Internet cafes everywhere. And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community  to be successful    and they're very ambitious. They want to be the next Einstein. And so when word came out that AIMS was opening  it spread very quickly via e mail and our website. And we got lots of applicants. Well  we designed AIMS as a    hour learning environment  and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning. You have to rethink  what is the university for  And that's really exciting. So we designed it to have interactive teaching. No droning on at the chalkboard. We emphasize problem solving  working in groups  every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades. Everyone lives together in this hotel    lecturers and students    and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at   a.m. The students don't usually leave the computer lab till   or   a.m. And then they're up again at eight in the morning. Lectures  problem solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place. We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development  because  in those areas  scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage. They'll publish  be invited to conferences. They'll do well. They'll have successful careers. And AIMS has done extremely well. Here is a list of last year's graduates  graduated in June  and what they're currently doing       of them. And where they are is indicated over here. And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students. And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places. Five students can be educated at AIMS for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe. But more important  the pan African student body is a continual source of strength  pride and commitment to Africa. We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa. So here you can see behind this list. When a county is colored yellow  we've received an application  orange  we've accepted an application  and green  a student has graduated. So here is where we were after the first graduation in     . And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green. So there's                 . We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal. We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS. And I'll just show you one. Tendai Mugwagwa  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa. I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree. I will be attending AIMS. My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot. You know  from physics to medicine  in particular  epidemiology and also mathematical modeling. Neil Turok  So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well. And I'll let her take it from there. TM  My name is Tendai Mugwagwa and I was a student at AIMS in      and     . After leaving AIMS  I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. After that  I came to the Netherlands where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology. Professor  Tendai is working very independently. She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital. So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa. So I'm happy she's here. NT  Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu. And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher. And then entering university in northern Nigeria. And after AIMS  Shehu wanted to do high energy physics  and he came to Cambridge. He's about to finish his Ph.D.  and he was filmed recently with someone you all know. Shehu  And from there we will be able to  hopefully  make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions. Stephen Hawking  That is nice. NT  Here are the current students at AIMS. There are    of them from    different countries  including    women. So now I'm going to get to my TED business. Well  we had a party. This is Africa    we have good parties in Africa. And last month  they threw a surprise party for me. Here's somebody you've seen already. I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture. So  we were having a party  as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point. This is Ezra. She's from Darfur. She's a physicist  and somehow stays smiling  in spite of everything going on back home. But she wants to continue in physics  and she's doing extremely well. This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic. And she's now at AIMS.  Applause  So now let me get to our TED wish. Well  it's not my TED wish  it's our wish  as you've already gathered. And our wish has two parts  one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK. Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African.  Applause  In striving for the heights of creative genius  we want to give thousands of people the motivation  the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high level skills they need to help Africa. Among them will be not only brilliant scientists    I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS    they'll also be the African Gates  Brins and Pages of the future. Well  I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple. AIMS is now a proven model. And what we need to do is to replicate it. We want to roll out    AIMS centers in the next five years  all over Africa. Each will have a pan African student body  but specialize in a different area of science. We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers  as it does at AIMS. And we want to add elements to the curriculum. We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills. The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan African institution  and its graduates will form a powerful network  working together for peace and progress across the continent. Over the last year  we've been visiting sites in Africa  looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers. And here are the ones we've selected. And each of these centers has a strong local team  each is in a beautiful place  an interesting place  which international lecturers will be happy to visit. And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this. Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country. And last November  the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology  held in Mombasa  called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS. So we have political support right across the continent. It won't be easy. At every site there will be huge challenges. Local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in. Conditions are very difficult  but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work. And we summarize them this way  the institutes have got to be relevant  innovative  cost effective and high quality. Why  Because we want Africa to be rich. Easy to remember the basic rules we need. So  just in ending  let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential  we can create a step change in Africa's future. Over time  they will contribute to African development and to science in ways we can only imagine. Thank you. As an architect you design for the present  with an awareness of the past  for a future which is essentially unknown. The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day. And I'd like to share some experience over the last    years    we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year    and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability. How far you can anticipate  what follows from it  what are the threats  what are the possibilities  the challenges  the opportunities  I think that    I've said in the past  many  many years ago  before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda  that it wasn't about fashion    it was about survival. But what I never said  and what I'm really going to make the point is  that really  green is cool. I mean  all the projects which have  in some way  been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle  in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life. I rarely actually quote anything  so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can   in  which somebody  at the end of last year  ventured the thought about what for that individual  as a kind of important observer  analyst  writer    a guy called Thomas Friedman  who wrote in the Herald Tribune  about     . He said   I think the most important thing to happen in      was that living and thinking green hit Main Street. We reached a tipping point this year where living  acting  designing  investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens  entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic  capitalistic  geo political and competitive thing they could do. Hence my motto  green is the new red  white and blue.  And I asked myself  in a way  looking back   When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear   And I think it was July           when  for the first time  man could look back at planet Earth. And  in a way  it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase. And before the kind of collapse of the communist system  I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia. And interestingly  as I think back  they were the first true environmentalists. They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion  fired about the problems of the Aral Sea. And at that period it was    in a way  a number of things were happening. Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru    again  a word that had not been coined. He was a design scientist  if you like  a poet  but he foresaw all the things that are happening now. It's another subject. It's another conversation. You can go back to his writings  it's quite extraordinary. It was at that time  with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies  his concerns as a citizen  as a kind of citizen of the planet  that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time. And it's a number of projects. I select this one because it was       and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands. And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook  and you had the hippie movement. And there are some of those qualities in this drawing  which seeks to sum up the recommendations. And all the components are there which are now in common parlance  in our vocabulary  you know     odd years later  wind energy  recycling  biomass  solar cells. And in parallel at that time  there was a very kind of exclusive design club. People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams  and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun. This is going back the mid '  s  '  s. And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style    access to comfort  to amenities    it was very  very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image  would be very  very stylishly packaged. And that  and more besides  would be in the palm of your hand. And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where  as the virtual world  which brings so many people together here  finally connects with the physical world  there is the reality that that has become humanized  so that digital world has all the friendliness  all the immediacy  the orientation of the analog world. Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here  as we generously had gifted at lunchtime  the  unclear   which is a further kind of development    and again  inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel. A very  very beautiful object. So  something which in  the  '  s  '  s was very exclusive has now become  interestingly  quite inclusive. And the reference to the iPod as iconic  and in a way evocative of performance  delivery    quite interesting that  in  the beginning of the year       the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid  energy conscious vehicle  which rivals the iPod as an iconic product. And I think it's very tempting to  in a way  seduce ourselves    as architects  or anybody involved with the design process    that the answer to our problems lies with buildings. Buildings are important  but they're only a component of a much bigger picture. In other words  as I might seek to demonstrate  if you could achieve the impossible  the equivalent of perpetual motion  you could design a carbon free house  for example. That would be the answer. Unfortunately  it's not the answer. It's only the beginning of the problem. You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit. For example  if  in that Bucky inspired phrase  we draw back and we look at planet Earth  and we take a kind of typical  industrialized society  then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings     percent  transport     percent  and industry. But again  that only shows part of the picture. If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport  in other words  the transport of people  which is    percent  then    percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together. So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities  of which the buildings are a part. For example  if you take  and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city  what I'll call  simplistically  a North American city    and Detroit is not a bad example  it is very car dependent. The city goes out in annular rings  consuming more and more green space  and more and more roads  and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center    which again  the city center  as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial  again becomes dead. If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example    and Munich is not a bad example of that  with the greater dependence on walking and cycling    then a city which is really only twice as dense  is only using one tenth of the energy. In other words  you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous. So basically  if you wanted to generalize  you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there  that the energy consumed reduces dramatically. Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity  mass transit  the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance  the quality of civic spaces. But again  you can see Detroit  in yellow at the top  extraordinary consumption  down below Copenhagen. And Copenhagen  although it's a dense city  is not dense compared with the really dense cities. In the year       a rather interesting thing happened. You had for the first time mega cities   of    million or more  which were occurring in the developing world. And now  out of typically    cities     of those mega cities are in the developing world. So you have to ask yourself    the environmental impact of  for example  China or India. If you take China  and you just take Beijing  you can see on that traffic system  and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles. In other words  if you put onto the roads  as is currently happening        new cars every day    statistically  it's the biggest booming auto market in the world    and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing. And that urbanization is extraordinary  accelerated pace. So  if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities  which took     years  then that same process is happening in    years. In other words  it is accelerating by a factor of   . And quite interestingly  over something like a    year period  we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy  over that period where the urbanization has trebled. If I pull back from that global picture  and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology    which  as a tool  is a tool for designers  and I cite our own experience as a company  and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects    then how do you measure that change of technology  How does it affect the design of buildings  And particularly  how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy  create less pollution and are more socially responsible  That story  in terms of buildings  started in the late '  s  early '  s. The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber  in a small market town in the northeast of England  commuting distance with London. And here  the first thing you can see is that this building  the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket  a kind of insulating garden  which is also about the celebration of public space. In other words  for this community  they have this garden in the sky. So the humanistic ideal is very  very strong in all this work  encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here  where you can see greenery  you can see sunlight  you have a connection with nature. And nature is part of the generator  the driver for this building. And symbolically  the colors of the interior are green and yellow. It has facilities like swimming pools  it has flextime  it has a social heart  a space  you have contact with nature. Now this was     . In       this building received an award. And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time. And the people who'd created it came back  the project managers  the company chairmen then. And they were saying  you know   The architects  Norman was always going on about designing for the future  and you know  it didn't seem to cost us any more. So we humored him  we kept him happy.  The image at the top  what it doesn't    if you look at it in detail  really what it is saying is you can wire this building. This building was wired for change. So  in       the image there is of typewriters. And when the photograph was taken  it's word processors. And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology. We were fortunate  because in a way our building was future proofed. It anticipated change  even though those changes were not known. Round about that design period leading up to this building  I did a sketch  which we pulled out of the archive recently. And I was saying  and I wrote   But we don't have the time  and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level.  In other words  we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building. And that would be to create a kind of three dimensional bubble    a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate  would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads. Notwithstanding the fact that the building  as a green building  is very much a pioneering building. And if I fast forward in time  what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory. The library of the Free University  which opened last year  is an example of that. And again  the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality. And a combination of devices here  the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks  and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin  which enables the building to be ventilated  to consume dramatically less energy  and where it's really working with the forces of nature. And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it. Again  coming back to that thing about the lifestyle  and in a way  the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit. So it's not a kind of sacrifice  quite the reverse. I think it's a great    it's a celebration. And you can measure the performance  in terms of energy consumption  of that building against a typical library. If I show another aspect of that technology then  in a completely different context    this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland. Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials  but that material    because of the technology  the computing ability  the ability to prefabricate  make high performance components out of timber    very much at the cutting edge. And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology  the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit  to transfer that information now  directly into the factory. So if you cross the border    just across the border    a small factory in Germany  and here you can see the guy with his computer screen  and those points in space are communicated. And on the left are the cutting machines  which then  in the factory  enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very  very few millimeters  to be slotted together on site. And then interestingly  that building to then be clad in the oldest technology  which is the kind of hand cut shingles. One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish. And again  the way in which that works as a building  for those of us who can enjoy the spaces  to live and visit there. If I made the leap into these new technologies  then how did we    what happened before that  I mean  you know  what was life like before the mobile phone  the things that you take for granted  Well  obviously the building still happened. I mean  this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of       which opened in       with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here. And in the absence of computers  you have to physically model. So for example  we would put models under an artificial sky. For wind tunnels  we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air  and the many kilometers of cable and so on. And the turning point was probably  in our terms  when we had the first computer. And that was at the time that we sought to redesign  reinvent the airport. This is Terminal Four at Heathrow  typical of any terminal    big  heavy roof  blocking out the sunlight  lots of machinery  big pipes  whirring machinery. And Stansted  the green alternative  which uses natural light  is a friendly place  you know where you are  you can relate to the outside. And for a large part of its cycle  not needing electric light    electric light  which in turn creates more heat  which creates more cooling loads and so on. And at that particular point in time  this was one of the few solitary computers. And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted. Not going back very far in time        that's our office. And if you looked very closely  you'd see that people were drawing with pencils  and they were pushing  you know  big rulers and triangles. It's not that long ago     years  and here we are now. I mean  major transformation. Going back in time  there was a lady called Valerie Larkin  and in       she had all our information on one disk. Now  every week  we have the equivalent of    million disks  which record our archival information on past  current and future projects. That reaches    kilometers into the sky. This is the view you would get  if you looked down on that. But meanwhile  as you know  wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature  set in the context of that  interestingly  those buildings which are celebratory and very  very relevant to this place. Our Reichstag project  which has a very familiar agenda  I'm sure  as a public place where we sought to  in a way  through a process of advocacy  reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians  public space. And maybe its hidden agenda  an energy manifesto    something that would be free  completely free of fuel as we know it. So it would be totally renewable. And again  the humanistic sketch  the translation into the public space  but this very  very much a part of the ecology. But here  not having to model it for real. Obviously the wind tunnel had a place  but the ability now with the computer to explore  to plan  to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature  natural ventilation  to be able to model the chamber below  and to look at biomass. A combination of biomass  aquifers  burning vegetable oil    a process that  quite interestingly  was developed in Eastern Germany  at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc. So really  retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean  it was virtually pollution free. You can measure it again. You can compare how that building  in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year    at the time that we took that project  over       tons    what it would have been with natural gas and finally  with the vegetable oil      tons. I mean  a    percent reduction    virtually clean. We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank    its dependence on natural ventilation  the way that you can model those gardens  the way they spiral around. But again  very much about the lifestyle  the quality    something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work. And again  we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption. There is an evolution here between the projects  and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further    the project in the city in London. And this sequence shows the buildup of that model. But what it shows first  which I think is quite interesting  is that here you see the circle  you see the public space around it. What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site  If  for example  you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement  it's the same amount of space. And finally  you profile this  you cut grooves into it. The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views  which give light  ventilation  make the building fresher. And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance  which is a mesh of triangulated structures    again  in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller  and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity. And here  if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria  the way in which now  with a computer  we can model the forces  we can see the high pressure  the low pressure  the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing. So it also has the ability  all the time  regardless of the direction of the wind  to be able to make the building fresh and efficient. And unlike conventional buildings  the top of the building is celebratory. It's a viewing place for people  not machinery. And the base of the building is again about public space. Comparing it with a typical building  what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large scale thinking  And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project. It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying. The level is dropping  rather like the Aral Sea. And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it. So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline  a pipe  sometimes above the surface  sometimes buried  that will redress that  and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea. And our translation of that  using a lot of the thinking built up over the    years  is to say  what if that  instead of being just a pipe  what if it is a lifeline  What if it is the equivalent  depending on where you are  of the Grand Canal  in terms of tourists  habitation  desalination  agriculture  In other words  water is the lifeblood. And if you just go back to the previous image  and you look at this area of volatility and hostility  that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause  in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense. Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication. And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world  then it's absolutely central to society. And how do we make more legible in this growing world  especially in some of the places that I'm talking about    China  for example  which in the next ten years will create     new airports. Now what form do they take  How do you make them more friendly at that scale  Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age  because you always have a point of reference. So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society  And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building. It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.        excuse me         people working    hours  seven days. Larger by    percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow    built    plus the new  un built Terminal Five. And the challenge here is a building that will be green  that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel  is about friendly  is coming back to that starting point  is very  very much about the lifestyle. And perhaps these  in the end  as celebratory spaces. As Hubert was talking over lunch  as we sort of engaged in conversation  talked about this  talked about cities. Hubert was saying  absolutely correctly   These are the new cathedrals.  And in a way  one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve  when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations. And I was voicing the thought that    it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve  a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from      to         that maybe  you know  the future was the most powerful  innovative sort of nation. The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say   We put a man on the moon.  You know  who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels  with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes  and so on. And that's a concerted platform. It's more than one device  you know  it's renewable. And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year  I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other  larger countries out there    the Chinas  the Indias  the Asian Pacific tigers. Thank you very much. Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back  just the way I am    kind of a royal wave. You can mimic what you can see. You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm. Soon  you'll be able to look inside your brain and program  control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there. I'm going to tell you about that technology. People have wanted to look inside the human mind  the human brain  for thousands of years. Well  coming out of the research labs just now  for our generation  is the possibility to do that. People envision this as being very difficult. You had to take a spaceship  shrink it down  inject it into the bloodstream. It was terribly dangerous.  Laughter  You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries. But now  we have a real technology to do this. We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain. We're going to do it non invasively using MRI. We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation. We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain    literally  fly into his body    but more importantly  we can look into his mind. When Peter moves his arm  that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place. Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms  that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains. What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis. We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds  and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner. He can look at these        points of activation per second. If he can see this pattern in his own brain  he can learn how to control it. There have been three ways to try to impact the brain  the therapist's couch  pills and the knife. This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have. We all know that as we form thoughts  they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains. Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself  you pull your hand away. But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time  it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you. If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain  we can form  D models and watch in real time the brain process information  and then we can select the areas that produce the pain. So put your arms back up and flex your bicep. Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing. What you're seeing here is  we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient. This may shock you  but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time. They're watching their own brain activation  and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain. They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates. As they do it  in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled. When they control their brain  they can control their pain. This is an investigational technology  but  in clinical trials  we're seeing a    to    percent decrease in chronic pain patients. This is not  The Matrix.  You can only do this to yourself. You take control. I've seen inside my brain. You will too  soon. When you do  what do you want to control  You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself  all your experiences. These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail. But I want to leave with you the big question. We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into  using this technology  the human mind and brain. Where will we take it  I'm delighted to be here. I'm honored by the invitation  and thanks. I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in  but unfortunately  I suspect that what I'm interested in won't interest many other people. First off  my badge says I'm an astronomer. I would love to talk about my astronomy  but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter. So I'm not going to talk about that. It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in      and       when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs. And I caught the guys  and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB  and stealing information and selling it. And I'd love to talk about that    and it'd be fun    but     years later ... I find computer security  frankly  to be kind of boring. It's tedious. I'm    The first time you do something  it's science. The second time  it's engineering. A third time  it's just being a technician. I'm a scientist. Once I do something  I do something else. So  I'm not going to talk about that. Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book   Silicon Snake Oil   or my second book  nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don't belong in schools. I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools. My idea is  no  No  Get them out of schools  and keep them out of schools. And I'd love to talk about this  but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn't need much talking about    but I guess I may be very wrong about that  and everything else that I've said. So don't go back and read my dissertation. It probably has lies in it as well. Having said that  I outlined my talk about five minutes ago. And if you look at it over here  the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future. I'm supposed to talk about the future  yes  Oh  right. And my feeling is  asking me to talk about the future is bizarre  because I've got gray hair  and so  it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future. In fact  I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be  if you really want to know about the future  don't ask a technologist  a scientist  a physicist. No  Don't ask somebody who's writing code. No  if you want to know what society's going to be like in    years  ask a kindergarten teacher. They know. In fact  don't ask just any kindergarten teacher  ask an experienced one. They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation. I don't. Nor  I suspect  do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring. Certainly  all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there. But to me  things aren't the future. What I ask myself is  what's society is going to be like  when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on screen time  but have never gone bowling together  Change is happening  and the change that is happening is not one that is in software. But that's not what I'm going to talk about. I'd love to talk about it  it'd be fun  but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now  Oh    the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about is right over here. Right over here. Is that visible  What I'd like to talk about is one sided things. I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side. Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops  but I'm one of the very few people  if not the only person in the world  that makes Klein bottles. Right away  I hope that all of your eyes glaze over. This is a Klein bottle. For those of you in the audience who know  you roll your eyes and say  yup  I know all about it. It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside. It has zero volume. And it's non orientable. It has wonderful properties. If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together  you get one of these  and I make them out of glass. And I'd love to talk to you about this  but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because    However  the  D  in TED of course stands for design. Just two weeks ago I made    you know  I've been making small  medium and big Klein bottles for the trade. But what I've just made    and I'm delighted to show you  first time in public here. This is a Klein bottle wine bottle  which  although in four dimensions it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all  it's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions. And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions  it can hold fluids. So it's highly    that one's the cool one. That was a month of my life. But although I would love to talk about topology with you  I'm not going to. Instead  I'm going to mention my mom  who passed away last summer. Had collected photographs of me  as mothers will do. Could somebody put this guy up  And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me  standing    well  sitting    in       in front of a bunch of dials. And I looked at it  and said  oh my god  that was me  when I was working at the electronic music studio  As a technician  repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow  Way back machine. And I said to myself  oh yeah  And it sent me back. Soon after that  I found in another picture that she had  a picture of me. This guy over here of course is me. This man is Robert Moog  the inventor of the Moog synthesizer  who passed away this past August. Robert Moog was a generous  kind person  extraordinarily competent engineer. A musician who took time from his life to teach me  a sophomore  a freshman at SUNY Buffalo. He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer  but we'd be sitting there    I'm studying physics at the time. This is             . We're studying physics  I'm studying physics  and he's saying   That's a good thing to do. Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics.  Mentoring me. He'd come up and spend hours and hours with me. He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school. In the background  my bicycle. I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room. Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this. We sat around talking about Fourier transforms  Bessel functions  modulation transfer functions  stuff like this. Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us. Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog. And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do    I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave  almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett Packard oscilloscope. Oh  cool. I can get to this place over here  right  Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about    is that okay  It says kids over here  that's what I'd like to talk about. I've decided that  for me at least  I don't have a big enough head. So I think locally and I act locally. I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very  very locally. So Ph.D. this  and degree there  and the yadda yadda. I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago. And one of them  several of them would come up to me and say   Well  how come you ain't teaching   And I said   Well  I've taught graduate    I've had graduate students  I've taught undergraduate classes.  No  they said   If you're so into kids and all this stuff  how come you ain't over here on the front lines  Put your money where you mouth is.  Is true. Is true. I teach eighth grade science four days a week. Not just showing up every now and then. No  no  no  no  no. I take attendance. I take lunch hour.  Applause  This is not    no  no  no  this is not claps. I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do. Not just show up to class every now and then. Teach a solid week. Okay  I'm teaching three quarters time  but good enough. One of the things that I've done for my science students is to tell them   Look  I'm going to teach you college level physics. No calculus  I'll cut out that. You won't need to know trig. But you will need to know eighth grade algebra  and we're going to do serious experiments. None of this open to chapter seven and do all the odd problem sets. We're going to be doing genuine physics.  And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now. Oh  before I even turn that on  one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class    this is through the lens  and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light. My students in El Cerrito    with my help  of course  and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope    measured the speed of light. We were off by    percent. How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light  In addition to that  we've measured the speed of sound. I'd love to measure the speed of light here. I was all set to do it and I was thinking   Aw man   I was just going to impose upon the powers that be  and measure the speed of light. And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it  but then it turns out that to set up here  you have like    minutes to set up  And there's no time to do it. So  next time  maybe  I'll measure the speed of light  But meanwhile  let's measure the speed of sound  Well  the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo. But  probably    one of my students  Ariel  unclear   said   Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation   And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ... is a constant. When the frequency goes up  the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up  frequency goes down. So  if we have a wave here    over here  that's what's interesting    as the pitch goes up  things get closer  pitch goes down  things stretch out. Right  This is simple physics. All of you know this from eighth grade  remember  What they didn't tell you in physics    in eighth grade physics    but they should have  and I wish they had  was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light  you get a constant. And that constant is the speed of sound. So  in order to measure the speed of sound  all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well  that's easy. I've got a frequency counter right here. Set it up to around A  above A  above A. There's an A  more or less. Now  so I know the frequency. It's  .   kilohertz. I measure its wavelength. All I need now is to flip on another beam  and the bottom beam is me talking  right  So anytime I talk  you'd see it on the screen. I'll put it over here  and as I move this away from the source  you'll notice the spiral. The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave  coming out this way. Those of you who are physicists  I hear you rolling your eyes  but bear with me.  Laughter  To measure the wavelength  all I need to do is measure the distance from here    one full wave    over to here. From here to here is the wavelength of sound. So  I'll put a measuring tape here  measuring tape here  move it back over to here. I've moved the microphone    centimeters.  .  meters from here  back to here     centimeters. OK  let's go back to Mr. Elmo. And we'll say the frequency is  .   kilohertz  or     . The wavelength was  .  meters. Let's figure out what this is.  .   times  .  over here is     meters per second. If you look it up in the book  it's really    . But  here with kludgy material  and lousy drink    we've been able to measure the speed of sound to    not bad. Pretty good. All of which comes to what I wanted to say. Go back to this picture of me a million years ago. It was       the Vietnam War was going on  and I'm like   Oh my God   I'm studying physics  Landau  Lipschitz  Resnick and Halliday. I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus. There's a riot  Hey  Elmo's done  off. There's a riot going on on campus  and the police are chasing me  right  I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says   You  You're a student.  Pulls out a gun. Goes boom  And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh  I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe. This cop comes after me with a rifle. He wants to clunk me over the head  I'm saying   I got to clear out of here   I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall. It's one of these bell tower buildings. The cop's chasing me. Chasing me up the first floor  second floor  third floor. Chases me into this room. The entranceway to the bell tower. I slam the door behind me  climb up  go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking. And I'm thinking   Oh yeah  the square root of the length is proportional to its period.   Laughter  I keep climbing up  go back. I go to a place where a dowel splits off. There's a clock  clock  clock  clock. The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it. I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity. I climb up  and there's this place  way in the back  that you climb up this wooden ladder. I pop up the top  and there's a cupola. A dome  one of these ten foot domes. I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads  shooting tear gas  and watching students throwing bricks. And I'm asking   What am I doing here  Why am I here   Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said. Namely  that when they cast bells  they write inscriptions on them. So  I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells  and I look at it. I'm asking myself   Why am I here   So  at this time  I'd like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells   All truth is one. In this light  may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind  from darkness to light  from narrowness to broad mindedness  from prejudice to tolerance. It is the voice of life  which calls us to come and learn.  Thank you very much. Good morning. Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all  Leonardo da Vinci. We're all familiar with his fantastic work    his drawings  his paintings  his inventions  his writings. But we do not know his face. Thousands of books have been written about him  but there's controversy  and it remains  about his looks. Even this well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians. So  what do you think  Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it  Let's find out. Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him. He drew people  anatomy  plants  animals  landscapes  buildings  water  everything. But no faces  I find that hard to believe. His contemporaries made faces  like the ones you see here    en face or three quarters. So  surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time. So let's try to find them. I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self portraits  we would find his face looking at us. So I looked at all of his drawings  more than      and looked for male portraits. There are about      you see them here. Which ones of these could be self portraits  Well  for that they have to be done as we just saw  en face or three quarters. So we can eliminate all the profiles. It also has to be sufficiently detailed. So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized. And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome  even beautiful man. So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures. And look what happens    only three candidates remain that fit the bill. And here they are. Yes  indeed  the old man is there  as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus. And lastly  the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted   The Musician.  Before we go into these faces  I should explain why I have some right to talk about them. I've made more than       portraits myself for newspapers  over the course of           years  sorry     years only. But there are        and very few artists have drawn so many faces. So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces. OK  now let's look at these three portraits. And hold onto your seats  because if we zoom in on those faces  remark how they have the same broad forehead  the horizontal eyebrows  the long nose  the curved lips and the small  well developed chin. I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that. There is no reason why these portraits should look alike. All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self portrait  and look  they are very similar. Now  are they made in the right order  The young man should be made first. And as you see here from the years that they were created  it is indeed the case. They are made in the right order. What was the age of Leonardo at the time  Does that fit  Yes  it does. He was        and    when these were made. So we have three pictures  potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time. But how do we know it's him  and not someone else  Well  we need a reference. And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted. It's a statue made by Verrocchio  of David  for which Leonardo posed as a boy of   . And if we now compare the face of the statue  with the face of the musician  you see the very same features again. The statue is the reference  and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces. Ladies and gentlemen  this story has not yet been published. It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first. The icon of icons finally has a face. Here he is  Leonardo da Vinci. Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union  a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside. With it  they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space. The rocket was huge. And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside. On October          they launched their rocket. One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time   We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik. In the olden days  explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe. Now we have the good fortune to open up space. And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy.  You're watching snippets from  Sputnik   my fifth documentary feature  which is just about completed. It tells the story of Sputnik  and the story of what happened to America as a result. For days after the launch  Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity. A man made moon visible by ordinary citizens  it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space. But just three days later  on a day they called Red Monday  the media and the politicians told us  and we believed  that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology  and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs  using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile. All hell broke loose. Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America    historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or     . It provoked the missile gap. It exploded an arms race. It began the space race. Within a year  Congress funded huge weapons increases  and we went from       nuclear weapons to       . And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases. For example  some here will remember this day  June       the National Civil Defense Drill  where tens of millions of people in    cities went underground. Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in    Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen  and that at least    percent of our population was going to be killed. But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well. For example  some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik. Support for engineering  math and science    education in general    boomed. And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA  and the Internet  and  of course  NASA. My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media. But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation  into something that was overall very good for America.  Sputnik  will soon be released. In closing  I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors  longtime TEDster  Jay Walker. And I'd like to thank you all. Thank you  Chris. There is nothing bigger or older than the universe. The questions I would like to talk about are  one  where did we come from  How did the universe come into being  Are we alone in the universe  Is there alien life out there  What is the future of the human race  Up until the     s  everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time. Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us. This meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back  we find we must have all been on top of each other about    billion years ago. This was the Big Bang  the beginning of the universe. But was there anything before the Big Bang  If not  what created the universe  Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did  We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. First  there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe  given its state over all of space at one time. And second  there was no question of the initial state of the universe. We have made good progress on the first part  and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. But until recently  we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. However  this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. Under extreme conditions  general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space. This removes the distinction between time and space  and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state. The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing. Moreover  we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states. These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background  which is an imprint of the very early universe. We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence. I now turn to the second big question  are we alone  or is there other life in the universe  We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth  so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets  of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy. But we don't know how life first appeared. We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing. The first is that we have fossils of algae from  .  billion years ago. The Earth was formed  .  billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years. So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible  which is short compared to the    billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. If it was very low  one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available. On the other hand  we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. I am discounting the reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos  If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring  it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far. Furthermore  despite an extensive search by the SETI project  we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows. This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years. Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet. This brings me to the last of the big questions  the future of the human race. If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy  we should make sure we survive and continue. But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history. Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially  along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill. But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years  let alone the next thousand or million. Our only chance of long term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth  but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years  our future is in space. That is why I am in favor of manned    or should I say   personned    space flight. All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed  it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe  and we are making good progress. Thank you for listening. Chris Anderson  Professor  if you had to guess either way  do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way  as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher  This answer took seven minutes  and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED. Stephen Hawking  I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years  otherwise we would have heard radio waves. The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long  but destroy themselves. CA  Professor Hawking  thank you for that answer. We will take it as a salutary warning  I think  for the rest of our conference this week. Professor  we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today. Thank you very much indeed. I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about       times. I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time  so    well it's    I don't want or need to raise the bar  I'm actually trying to lower the bar. Because I've cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session. And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief  but about behavior. Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism. How dare we be optimistic  Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief  an intellectual posture. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said   You must become the change you wish to see in the world.  And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone  except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior. But the word  behavior  is also  I think  sometimes misunderstood in this context. I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids  and Tipper and I put    solar panels on our house  and dug the geothermal wells  and did all of that other stuff. But  as important as it is to change the lightbulbs  it is more important to change the laws. And when we change our behavior in our daily lives  we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this  we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy. In order to solve the climate crisis  we have to solve the democracy crisis. And we have one. I have been trying to tell this story for a long time. I was reminded of that recently  by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at  just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her   s  looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction  also just staring at me. And so I said   How do you do   And she said   You know  if you dyed your hair black  you would look just like Al Gore.   Laughter  Many years ago  when I was a young congressman  I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control    the nuclear arms race. And the military historians taught me  during that quest  that military conflicts are typically put into three categories  local battles  regional or theater wars  and the rare but all important global  world war    strategic conflicts. And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources  a different approach  a different organizational model. Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories  and most of what we think about are local environmental problems  air pollution  water pollution  hazardous waste dumps. But there are also regional environmental problems  like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast  and from Western Europe to the Arctic  and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico. And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis is the rare but all important global  or strategic  conflict. Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response appropriately. We need a worldwide  global mobilization for renewable energy  conservation  efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy. We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources and political will. But the political will has to be mobilized  in order to mobilize the resources. Let me show you these slides here. I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here  of course  is the North Polar ice cap. Greenland remains. Twenty eight years ago  this is what the polar ice cap    the North Polar ice cap    looked like at the end of the summer  at the fall equinox. This last fall  I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder  Colorado  and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory. This is what's happened in the last    years. To put it in perspective       was the previous record. Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers. The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically    doesn't look quite the same size    but it is exactly the same size as the United States  minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona. The amount that disappeared in      was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi. The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter  but not as permanent ice  as thin ice    vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years. That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland. Already  around the Arctic Circle    this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA. The amount of a moderate to severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California.  They were the best of times  they were the worst of times   the most famous opening sentence in English literature. I want to share briefly a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter is about     kilometers larger  but essentially the same size. They have exactly the same amount of carbon. But the difference is  on Earth  most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere  deposited in the ground as coal  oil  natural gas  etc. On Venus  most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is    degrees on average. On Venus  it's    . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible  and putting it into the atmosphere. It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun. It's three times hotter than Mercury  which is right next to the Sun. Now  briefly  here's an image you've seen  as one of the only old images  but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI  Climate. The global scientific community says  man made global warming pollution  put into the atmosphere  thickening this  is trapping more of the outgoing infrared. You all know that. At the last IPCC summary  the scientists wanted to say   How certain are you   They wanted to answer that     percent.  The Chinese objected  and so the compromise was  more than    percent.  Now  the skeptics say   Oh  wait a minute  this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun.  If that were true  the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere  if it's more coming in. If it's more being trapped on the way out  then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere. Here's the stratosphere  cooler. CSI  Climate. Now  here's the good news. Sixty eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. Sixty nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way. There has been progress  but here is the key  when given a list of challenges to confront  global warming is still listed at near the bottom. What is missing is a sense of urgency. If you agree with the factual analysis  but you don't feel the sense of urgency  where does that leave you  Well  the Alliance for Climate Protection  which I head in conjunction with Current TV    who did this pro bono    did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this. This is the winner. NBC    I'll show all of the networks here    the top journalists for NBC asked     questions in      of the presidential candidates  two of them were about the climate crisis. ABC      questions  two about the climate crisis. Fox  two. CNN  two. CBS  zero. From laughs to tears    this is one of the older tobacco commercials. So here's what we're doing. This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us. But it's not just the developed nations. The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace. And actually  their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in     . And they're catching up very dramatically. The total concentrations  by       they will be essentially where we were in     . If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture  we would still have this crisis. But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia    over thirty years. This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '  s. '  s. '  s. '  s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can. We have the technologies. We have to have a unified view of how to go about this  the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions  all has a single  very simple solution. People say   What's the solution   Here it is. Put a price on carbon. We need a CO  tax  revenue neutral  to replace taxation on employment  which was invented by Bismarck    and some things have changed since the   th century. In the poor world  we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis. Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted  if we do not solve the climate crisis. But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries. This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe. This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating solar  renewable energy plants  linked in a so called  supergrid  to supply all of the electrical power to Europe  largely from developing countries    high voltage DC currents. This is not pie in the sky  this can be done. We need to do it for our own economy. The latest figures show that the old model is not working. There are a lot of great investments that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil  then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub prime carbon assets. And it is based on an old model. Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense. I have a stake in these  so I'll have a disclaimer there. But geothermal  concentrating solar  advanced photovoltaics  efficiency and conservation. You've seen this slide before  but there's a change. The only two countries that didn't ratify    and now there's only one. Australia had an election. And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there. And we trained     people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia. Lot of other things contributed to it  but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia's position on Kyoto  and he has. Now  they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had. This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names  we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina  and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta. We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture. Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S. are up to        and I thought I saw one go by there  just to localize this    which is good news. Now  to close  we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine. What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially  but also the rest of the world  have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice    just as Jill  Bolte  Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through. We now have a culture of distraction. But we have a planetary emergency. And we have to find a way to create  in the generation of those alive today  a sense of generational mission. I wish I could find the words to convey this. This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet. Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote. We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it. If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War  we could be well on the way to solving this challenge. We have the capacity to do it. One final point  I'm optimistic  because I believe we have the capacity  at moments of great challenge  to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us. Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying   Oh  this is so terrible. What a burden we have.  I would like to ask you to reframe that. How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts  A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do  I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which  a thousand years from now  philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying  they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future. Let's do that. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  For so many people at TED  there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form    one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true. That hurts. Al Gore  You have no idea.  Laughter  CA  When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now    I mean  there's    are you excited by their plans on global warming  AG  The answer to the question is hard for me because  on the one hand  I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee    certain nominee    John McCain  and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination    all three have a very different and forward leaning position on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership  and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration. And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that    as illustrated by the questions    that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters  by the way  the analysis of all the questions    and  by the way  the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label   Clean Coal.  Has anybody noticed that  Every single debate has been sponsored by  Clean Coal.   Now  even lower emissions   The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed. So they're saying the right things and they may    whichever of them is elected    may do the right thing  but let me tell you  when I came back from Kyoto in       with a feeling of great happiness that we'd gotten that breakthrough there  and then confronted the United States Senate  only one out of     senators was willing to vote to confirm  to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say. This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization. CO  is the exhaling breath of our civilization  literally. And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern requires a scope  a scale  a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past. So that's why I began by saying  be optimistic in what you do  but be an active citizen. Demand    change the light bulbs  but change the laws. Change the global treaties. We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy    this    We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that. Use the Internet. Go on the Internet. Connect with people. Become very active as citizens. Have a moratorium    we shouldn't have any new coal fired generating plants that aren't able to capture and store CO   which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources. Now  nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe that between now and November  it is possible. This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign    grassroots mobilization  television ads  Internet ads  radio  newspaper    with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen. We need help. We need help. CA  In terms of your own personal role going forward  Al  is there something more than that you would like to be doing  AG  I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question. What can I do  Buckminster Fuller once wrote   If the future of all human civilization depended on me  what would I do  How would I be   It does depend on all of us  but again  not just with the light bulbs. We  most of us here  are Americans. We have a democracy. We can change things  but we have to actively change. What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness. And that's hard to    that's hard to create    but it is coming. There's an old African proverb that some of you know that says   If you want to go quickly  go alone  if you want to go far  go together.  We have to go far  quickly. So we have to have a change in consciousness. A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency. A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge. CA  Al Gore  thank you so much for coming to TED. AG  Thank you. Thank you very much. So  as researchers  something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities  or achieve certain goals. And this is essential to the progress of science  or exploration of what is possible. But it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny  tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology. Something that motivates me  and gets me really excited about my research  is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population. I'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy. And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote. For those of you who aren't familiar with this device  it's a     video game controller. And it's mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities  so you can swing a tennis racket  or hit a baseball bat. But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high performing infrared camera. And I'm going to show you two demos of why this is useful. So here  I have my computer set up with the projector  and I have a Wii Remote sitting on top of it. And  for example  if you're in a school that doesn't have a lot money  probably a lot of schools  or if you're in an office environment  and you want an interactive whiteboard  normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars. So I'm going to show you how to create one with a Wii Remote. Now  this requires another piece of hardware  which is this infrared pen. You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack. It's got a battery  a button and an infrared LED    you guys can't see it    but it turns on whenever I push the button. Now  what this means is that if I run this piece of software  the camera sees the infrared dot  and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels. And now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface. So for about     of hardware  you can have your own whiteboard. This is Adobe Photoshop. Thank you. The software for this I've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free. In the three months this project has been public  it's been downloaded over half a million times. So teachers and students all around the world are already using this. Although it does do it for    dollars  there are some limitations of this approach. You get about    percent of the way there  for one percent of the cost. Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots  so this is actually a multi touch  interactive whiteboard system as well. For the second demo  I have this Wii Remote that's actually next to the TV. So it's pointing away from the display  rather than pointing at the display. And why this is interesting is that if you put on  say  a pair of safety glasses  that have two infrared dots in them  they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location. And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor  which has a  D room  with some targets floating in it. And you can see that it looks like a  D room. kind of like a video game  it sort of looks  D  but for the most part  the image looks pretty flat  and bound to the surface of the screen. But if we turn on head tracking    the computer can change the image that's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements. So let's switch back to that. So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community. Because this is about    dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii. So I'm looking forward to seeing some games  and actually Louis Castle  that's him down there  last week announced that Electronic Arts  one of the largest game publishers  is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking. And that's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product. Thank you. But actually  to me  what's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is how people actually found out about them. YouTube has really changed the way  or changed the speed  in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world. I'm doing some research in my lab with a video camera  and within the first week  a million people had seen this work  and literally within days  engineers  teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work. So I hope to see more of that in the future  and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community. So thank you very much. The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us. But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it  but you make it yourself. So  that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect    the idea that's been around for the last five to    years    that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby  in utero   that it'll raise our IQ points            percent. Great idea  but it doesn't work at all. So  you can't just listen to music  you have to make it somehow. And I'd add to that  that it's not just making it  but everybody  each of us  everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way  and that's one of the main parts of my work. So  with the MIT Media Lab  for quite a while now  we've been engaged in a field called active music. What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience  not just listening  but making music  And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers    we call these hyperinstruments    for Yo Yo Ma  Peter Gabriel  Prince  orchestras  rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument  so the instrument knows how it's being played. And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling  I can turn my cello into a voice  or into a whole orchestra  or into something that nobody has ever heard before. When we started making these  I started thinking  why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody  people who aren't fantastic Yo Yo Mas or Princes  So  we've made a whole series of instruments. One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera. It's a whole orchestra of about     instruments  all designed for anybody to play using natural skill. So  you can play a video game  drive through a piece of music  use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound  touch a special surface to make melodies  use your voice to make a whole aura. And when we make the Brain Opera  we invite the public to come in  to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera. We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna  where we built a museum around it. And that led to something which you probably do know. Guitar Hero came out of our lab  and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface  people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music  and playing it over and over and over again. So  the model works  but it's only the tip of the iceberg  because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero. And music is very fun  but it's also transformative. It's very  very important. Music can change your life  more than almost anything. It can change the way you communicate with others  it can change your body  it can change your mind. So  we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero. We are very involved in education. We have a long term project called Toy Symphony  where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive  but for little kids  so the kids will fall in love with making music  want to spend their time doing it  and then will demand to know how it works  how to make more  how to create. So  we make squeezy instruments  like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers  Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms    they gather your rhythm  and like hot potato  you send your rhythm to your friends  who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing    and a software package called Hyperscore  which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use  but once you use it  you can go quite deep    music in any style. And then  by pressing a button  it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces. We've had good enough  really  very powerful effects with kids around the world  and now people of all ages  using Hyperscore. So  we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context  for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music. So  one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music  mind and health. A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called  Musicophilia . It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book. If you haven't seen it  it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself  and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations. So we know  for instance  that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to. Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones  you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror  or can't tell anyone in their family  but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities. Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes  movement to people with Parkinson's disease. It's very powerful for depression  schizophrenia  many  many things. So  we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health. And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals. One of them is right near Boston  called Tewksbury Hospital. It's a long term state hospital  where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities. This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital  so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities. It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community. I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on. Video  They're manipulating each other's rhythms. It's a real experience  not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms  but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group. To get their hands on music  to shape it themselves  change it  to experiment with it  to make their own music. So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly. Everybody can experience music in a profound way  we just have to make different tools. The third idea I want to share with you is that music  paradoxically  I think even more than words  is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks  although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music. If I were here playing cello  or playing on a synth  or sharing my music with you  I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words  more personal things  perhaps deeper things. I think that's true for many of us  and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have  from ourselves to the outside world. The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now  called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera  one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now. And it's about a man  rich  successful  powerful  who wants to live forever. So  he figures out a way to download himself into his environment  actually into a series of books. So this guy wants to live forever  he downloads himself into his environment. The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy. And the opera is about what we can share  what we can pass on to others  to the people we love  and what we can't. Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument  like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier  but it's actually a robotic music instrument. So  as you can see in this prototype  gigantic piano strings  each string is controlled with a little robotic element    either little bows that stroke the strings  propellers that tickle the strings  acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage. These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character  Simon Powers  and his family. There are a whole series of them  kind of like a Greek chorus. They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music. They follow the characters. They're smart enough  we hope  not to bump into each other. They go off on their own. And then they can also  when you snap  line up exactly the way you'd like to. Even though they're cubes  they actually have a lot of personality. The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books. Every single book is robotic  so they all move  they all make sound  and when you put them all together  they turn into these walls  which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared  but the whole physical environment becomes this person. This is how he's chosen to represent himself. The books also have high packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display. And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System. This is a sneak preview. This premieres in Monaco    it's in September     . If by any chance you can't make it  another idea with this project    here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form  through music and through the environment. But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces  as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love. So instead of being grand opera  this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera. And  if you're going to make a personal opera  what about a personal instrument  Everything I've shown you so far    whether it's a hyper cello for Yo Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child    the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person  a virtuoso  a child. But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave  to the way my hands work  to what I do very skillfully  perhaps  to what I don't do so skillfully  I think that this is the future of interface  it's the future of music  the future of instruments. And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage  so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like. So  can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger  Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab  and Dan Ellsey. Dan  thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet  Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital. This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital  I can tell you that  because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music. So  first of all  Dan  do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are  Dan Ellsey  Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am    years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software. Tod Machover  And we're really excited to have you here  really Dan.  Applause  So we met Dan about three years ago  three and a half years ago  when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic  did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before  and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer. He's very shy  too. So  turned out he's a fantastic composer  and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many  many pieces. He makes his own CDs. Actually  he is quite well known in the Boston area    mentors people at the hospital and children  locally  in how to make their own music. And I'll let Adam tell you. So  Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT  an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators. What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces  but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument. So  you want to say a little bit about how you guys work  Adam Boulanger  Yes. So  Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person  and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face  it's in his breathing  it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music  That's our responsibility  and it doesn't make sense. So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance  with precision  with control  and despite his physical disability  to be able to do that  to be able to perform his piece of music. So  the process and the technology    basically  first we needed an engineering solution. So  you know  we have a FireWire camera  it looked at an infrared pointer. We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller. And this was actually the least interesting part of the work  you know  the design process. We needed an input  we needed continuous tracking  in the software  we look at the types of shapes he's making. But  then was the really interesting aspect of the work  following the engineering part  where  basically  we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out  you know  how does Dan move  What's useful to him as an expressive motion  You know  what's his metaphor for performance  What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music  So all the parameter fitting  and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan. And  you know  I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies    they provide access  they allow us to create pieces of creative work. But what about expression  What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work  You know  do our technologies allow us to express  Do they provide structure for us to do that  And  you know  that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So  you know  with Dan  we needed a new design process  a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform. And so that's what we'll do today. TM  So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now  DE  This is  My Eagle Song.  TM  So Dan is going to play a piece of his  called  My Eagle Song . In fact  this is the score for Dan's piece  completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore. So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore. He's incredibly fast at it  too  faster than I am  in fact. TM  He's really modest  too. So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms. He can place those exactly where he wants. Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window  draws the lines  places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore  you can see it also  you can see where the sections are  something might continue for a while  change  get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end. So that's the way he made his piece  and as Adam says  we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece. It's going to be looked at by this camera  analyze his movements  it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to. And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen. We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring. But instead of making it very literal  showing you exactly the camera tracing  we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement  and shows the way it's being analyzed. I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing  but I think it will also show you  if you look at that movement  that when Dan makes music  his motions are very purposeful  very precise  very disciplined and they're also very beautiful. So  in hearing this piece  as I mentioned before  the most important thing is the music's great  and it'll show you who Dan is. So  are we ready Adam  AB  Yeah. TM  OK  now Dan will play his piece  My Eagle Song  for you. TM  Bravo. One of the problems of writing  and working  and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. And so  to start helping that  I want to take us back to     . In       James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass circulation newspaper in New York City. And it cost about     dollars to start it  which was about the equivalent of        dollars of today. By    years later  by       doing the same thing    starting what was experienced as a mass  circulation daily paper    would come to cost two and a half million dollars.         two and a half million     years. That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net. And that's what I want to talk about today  and how that relates to the emergence of social production. Starting with newspapers  what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information  knowledge and culture  which led to a stark bifurcation between producers    who had to be able to raise financial capital  just like any other industrial organization    and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. Now  the term  information society    information economy   for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact  for purposes of understanding what's happening today  that's wrong. Because for     years  we've had an information economy. It's just been industrial  which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars  and later  more for the telegraph  and the radio transmitter  and the television  and eventually the mainframe. And that meant they were market based  or they were government owned  depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next     years. Now  let me tell you a different story. Around June       the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. The Japanese had  for the first time  created the fastest supercomputer    the NEC Earth Simulator    taking the primary from the U.S.  and about two years later    this  by the way  is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer's capable of running    sigh of relief  IBM  Blue Gene  has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator. All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period  there's another supercomputer running in the world    SETI home. Four and a half million users around the world  contributing their leftover computer cycles  whenever their computer isn't working  by running a screen saver  and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become less capital intensive    that there's less money that's required    but that the ownership of this capital  the way the capitalization happens  is radically distributed. Each of us  in these advanced economies  has one of these  or something rather like it    a computer. They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network. And computation  storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person    and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information  knowledge and culture  in the hands of something like     million to a billion people around the planet. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution  the most important means  the most important components of the core economic activities    remember  we are in an information economy    of the most advanced economies  and there more than anywhere else  are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population  and we've got human creativity  human wisdom  human experience    the other major experience  the other major input    which unlike simple labor    stand here turning this lever all day long    is not something that's the same or fungible among people. Any one of you who has taken someone else's job  or tried to give yours to someone else  no matter how detailed the manual  you cannot transmit what you know  what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. In that we're unique  and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine. What's the effect of this  So  the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software. This is market share of Apache Web server    one of the critical applications in Web based communications. In       two groups of people said   Wow  this is really important  the Web  We need a much better Web server   One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided  you know  we really need this  we should write one  and what are we going to do with what    well  we're gonna share it  And other people will be able to develop it. The other was Microsoft. Now  if I told you that    years later  the motley crew of people  who didn't control anything that they produced  acquired    percent of the market and was the red line  it would be amazing  Right  Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right  But  in fact  of course  the story is it's the    percent  including the major e commerce site       percent of a critical application on which Web based communications and applications work is produced in this form  in direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue    in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net. Software has done this in a way that's been very visible  because it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. So  NASA  at some point  did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping  and they said  instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time  let's break it up into small components  put it up on the Web  and see if people  using a very simple interface  will actually spend five minutes here     minutes there  clicking. After six months         people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in  which was  quote   practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully trained Ph.D.   once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. Now  if you have a little girl  and she goes and writes to    well  not so little  medium little    tries to do research on Barbie. And she'll come to Encarta  one of the main online encyclopedias. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it  there's nothing more to the definition  including   manufacturers     plural     now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls  like this black Barbie.  Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com  which is Barbie  Klaus.  Laughter  On the other hand  if they go to Wikipedia  they'll find a genuine article    and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia  because Jimmy Wales is here    but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica  differently written  including the controversies over body image and commercialization  the claims about the way in which she's a good role model  etc. Another portion is not only how content is produced  but how relevance is produced. The claim to fame of Yahoo  was  we hire people to look    originally  not anymore    we hire people to look at websites and tell you    if they're in the index  they're good. This  on the other hand  is what        passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project  each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about  to say  this is good. So  this is the Open Directory Project  with        volunteers  each one spending a little bit of time  as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it  no one owns the output  it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting. This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google  the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing    the decision about what's relevant    to the community of the Web as a whole  doing whatever they want to do  so  page rank. The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers  or our people saying which is the most relevant  we're going to go out and count what you  people out there on the Web  for whatever reason    vanity  pleasure    produced links  and tied to each other. We're going to count those  and count them up. And again  here  you see Barbie.com  but also  very quickly  Adiosbarbie.com  the body image for every size. A contested cultural object  which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture  which is the classic market based mechanism  whoever pays the most is highest on the list. So  all of that is in the creation of content  of relevance  basic human expression. But remember  the computers were also physical. Just physical materials    our PCs    we share them together. We also see this in wireless. It used to be wireless was one person owned the license  they transmitted in an area  and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property. What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines  like Wi Fi devices  and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle  When I'm listening  when I'm not using  I can help you transfer your messages  and when you're not using  you'll help me transfer yours. And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented  at least for public security. If in      I told you  let's build a data storage and retrieval system. It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available    hours a day  seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world. It has to support over     million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack  including closing the main index  injecting malicious files  armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. It would take millions. But of course  what I'm describing is P P file sharing. Right  We always think of it as stealing music  but fundamentally  it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system  where people  for very obvious reasons  are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something. So  essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based  or non market based  they could be decentralized  or centralized. The price system was a market based and decentralized system. If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them  you had firms  if you wanted to be in the market    or you had governments or sometimes larger non profits in the non market. It was too expensive to have decentralized social production  to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. That was  in fact  economic. But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange. Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other  or for each other  as social beings. We do it all the time. It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact. What characterizes them is decentralized authority. You don't have to ask permission  as you do in a property based system. May I do this  It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share  if they want to  by themselves or with others  because property is one mechanism of coordination. But it's not the only one. Instead  what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market  information flows to decide what are interesting problems  who's available and good for something  motivation structures    remember  money isn't always the best motivator. If you leave a     check after dinner with friends  you don't increase the probability of being invited back. And if dinner isn't entirely obvious  think of sex.  Laughter  It also requires certain new organizational approaches. And in particular  what we've seen is task organization. You have to hire people who know what they're doing. You have to hire them to spend a lot of time. Now  take the same problem  chunk it into little modules  and motivations become trivial. Five minutes  instead of watching TV  Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning  or  in places that are more involved  like Wikipedia  gives me a certain set of social relations. So  a new social phenomenon is emerging. It's creating  and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition. Peer to peer networks assaulting the recording industry  free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft  Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms  Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias. But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses. As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging  you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers. Instead of building well behaved appliances    things that you know what they'll do in advance    you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values  a new set of things people value. You build platforms for self expression and collaboration. Like Wikipedia  like the Open Directory Project  you're beginning to build platforms  and you see that as a model. And you see surfers  people who see this happening  and in some sense build it into a supply chain  which is a very curious one. Right  You have a belief  stuff will flow out of connected human beings. That'll give me something I can use  and I'm going to contract with someone. I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary    that's what Google does  essentially. That's what IBM does in software services  and they've done reasonably well. So  social production is a real fact  not a fad. It is the critical long term shift caused by the Internet. Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts  it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information  the ability to find the best person  the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast. But    and this is the dark lining    it is threatened by    in the same way that it threatens    the incumbent industrial systems. So next time you open the paper  and you see an intellectual property decision  a telecoms decision  it's not about something small and technical. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other  and the way information  knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes  or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model  and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see. Thank you. It is interesting that in the United States  the most significant health care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care  whether it's private or public. There's no comparison at all. In Africa    where it is a major killer    it is totally ignored. And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it. A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.    million people die every year from heart disease.    million heart attacks and strokes occur. Most of this is in developing countries  and the majority is in Africa.    percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries    not in the West    and yet    percent of the resources are in the West. Who is at risk  People like you. It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that. All friends of Africa  that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time  should be very concerned about this deplorable situation. Has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night  and you start getting chest pains  shortness of breath  sweating  You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do  Will you fly back to the U.S.  Germany  Europe  No  you will die.    percent will die within    hours  if not treated. This is what's going on. In a look at the map of the U.S.    the graph here     million people here     million here. By the time you get to     it's almost no one left in Nigeria    life expectancy is   . It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses    they do    but they do not survive after the time that they reach about    years old and    years old. And those are the times they're most productive. Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development. But they're not there. The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents. If you cannot secure the parents  you cannot guarantee the security of the African child. What are the risk factors  It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those. These are just for information  hypertension  diabetes  obesity  lack of exercise. The usual suspects. Right here in Tanzania     percent of individuals have hypertension.    percent are getting treated. Only less than one percent are adequately treated. If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa  we'll save         lives a year. That's quite significant  Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius. In eight short years    we're here talking about HIV  malaria  which is all good. We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV. In eight short years  non communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in Africa. That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this. This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites    they go to USA  Germany  U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable. You can't depend on foreign aid alone. Here is the situation  countries are turning inwards. Post        the  United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with  their own internal issues. So  they spend their money trying to fix those problems. You can't rightly    it's not their responsibility  it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems. If they help  that's good  But that is not my expectation. These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them. If they have not worked  we have to look for alternative solutions. I'm here to talk to you about solutions. This has been    what has been a difficult sign to some of us. Several years ago  we started thinking about it. Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are. We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is. Everyone is ready to throw in money  in terms of free money aid to developing countries. Talk about sustainable investment  no one is interested. You can't raise money. I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States    I live in Nashville  Tennessee  health care capital of America.  It's  very easy to raise money for health care ventures. But start telling them  you know  we're going to try to do it in Nigeria    everyone runs away. That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here  if you want to help Africa  invest money in sustainable development. Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute  so you get a glimpse of what we do  and I'll talk a little bit more about it. What we have done is to show that high quality health care  comparable to the best anywhere in the world  can be done in a developing country environment. We have    positions right now    all of them trained  board certified in the USA  Canada or Britain. We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt  Cleveland Clinic    everywhere in the U.S.    and we do it for about    percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States. Additionally  we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay. We take care of everyone. Whether you have one dollar  two dollars    it doesn't matter. And I will tell you how we're able to do it. We make sure that we select our equipment properly. We go for modular units. Units that have multi modality functions have modular components. Easy to repair  and because of that  we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last. We emphasize training  and we make sure that this process is regenerative. Very soon we will all be dead and gone  but the problems will stay  unless we have people taking over from where we stopped. We made sure that we produced some things ourselves. We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals. We get the generators from the companies. We manufacture them in house  ourselves. That keeps the costs down. So  for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S.    that you'll get a unit dose for     dollars    when we're finished manufacturing it in house  we come at a price of about two dollars. We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology. All these problems we're talking about    if we bring development  they will all disappear. Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work  It's been proved  self care is cost effective. It extends opportunity to the rural centers  and we can use expertise in a very smart way. This is the way our centers are set up. We currently have three locations in the Caribbean  and we're planning a fourth one. And we have now decided to go into Africa. We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt  Nigeria. That project will be starting within the next few months. We hope to open in        . And we will do other centers. This model can be adapted to every disease process. All the units  all the centers  are linked through a switched hub to a central server  and all the images are populated to review stations. And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us  and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable. We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world  just by a click of the button. I'll lead you through  to see how this happens. This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in. I can call you in Switzerland and say   Listen  go into our system. Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study  tell me what you think.  They'll give me that information  and we'll make the care of the patient better. The patient doesn't have to travel. He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise. We also use  an  electronic medical record system. I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented       percent of U.S. practices do not have them  and yet the technology is there. But you know  they have that luxury. Because if you can't get it in Nashville  you can travel to Birmingham  two hours away  and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland  you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury  so we have to make it happen. When we do it  we will put the cost of care down. And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable. And everyone will get the care they deserve. It cannot just be technology  we recognize that. Prevention must be part of the solution    we emphasize that. But  you know  you have to tell people what can be done. It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive  and they go home and can't do it. They need to be alive  they need to feed. We recommend exercise as the most effective  simple  easy thing to do. We have had walks every year    every March  April. We form people into groups and make them go into challenges. Which group loses the most weight  we give them prizes. Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer  we give them prizes. We do this constantly. We encourage them to bring children. That way we start exposing the children from very early on  on what these issues are. Because once they learn it  they will stay with it. In doing this we have created at least     skilled jobs in Jamaica alone  and these are physicians with expertise and special training. We have taken care of over       indigent patients that could have died  including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology  complete heart block means certain death. If you don't get this pacemaker  you will be dead. So we are pleased with that. Indirectly  we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care. And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives. By the end of this year  we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care. In the first four months  it's been         dollars  averaging        dollars a month. The government will not do that  because they have competing needs. They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it. People say   How can you do that   This is how we can do that. At least       rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean. And  if they went to Miami  they will spend significantly more    eight to    times more. And they feel happy spending it at home  getting the same quality of care. And for that money    for every one patient that has the money to pay  it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay. For this to work  this progress must be sustainable. So  we emphasize training. Training is critical. We have gone further  we have formed a relationship with the University of Technology  Jamaica  where I now have an appointment. And we are starting a biomedical engineering program  so that we will train people locally  who can repair that equipment. That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues. We're also starting ancillary health care technology training programs    training people in echocardiography  cardiac ultrasound  those kinds of things. Now  with that kind of training  it gives people motivation. Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff. In the process  I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them. I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies. I came to the Heart Institute in       as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program. I spent three months at the Heart Institute. There's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here  and I think there's been an increased interest now in    particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting. Sharon Lazarus  I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean  since the past two years. I received training at this institution. I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases. Ernest Madu  The lesson in this is that it can be done  and it can be sustained  and you can make it possible for everyone. Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care  When have you been appointed to play God  It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person  no matter what fate has assigned to you  will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life. Next stop is West African Heart Institute  that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt  Nigeria  as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa. We will extend the same system into other areas  like dialysis treatment. And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation  we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it  and how you can do it. If we do this  we can change the face of health care in Africa. Africa has been good to us  it is time for us to give back to Africa. I am going. Those who want to come  I welcome you to come along with me. Thank you. The Value of Nothing  Out of Nothing Comes Something. That was an essay I wrote when I was    years old and I got a B .  Laughter  What I'm going to talk about  nothing out of something  and how we create. And I'm gonna try and do that within the    minute time span that we were told to stay within  and to follow the TED commandments  that is  actually  something that creates a near death experience  but near death is good for creativity. So  I also want to explain  because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie  or not true to universal creativity. And I've done it this way for half the audience  who is scientific. When I say we  I don't mean you  necessarily  I mean me  and my right brain  my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong. And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process  which includes a number of things that happened  actually    the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new. And that includes nature  and nurture  and what I refer to as nightmares. Now in the nature area  we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something  perhaps in our brains  some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect. And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means. And others  like my mother  would say that I get my material from past lives. Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk    van Gogh syndrome    that you have a little bit of  you know  psychosis  or depression. I do have to say  somebody    I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic  that he might have had temporal lobe seizures  and that might have caused his spurt of creativity  and I don't    I suppose it does something in some part of your brain. And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago  but it was during the time I was writing my last book  and some people say that book is quite different. I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis  you know  who am I  why am I this particular person  why am I not black like everybody else  And sometimes you're equipped with skills  but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity. I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist. And I had a miniature poodle. And it wasn't bad  but it wasn't really creative. Because all I could really do was represent in a very one on one way. And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book. And then  I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be  and you know  you look at those scores  and it wasn't bad  but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words. Also  one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma. And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had  and that is that  you know  I had expectations placed on me. That figure right there  by the way  figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old  and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age. I have some ones that were long lasting  from the age of five to     this was supposed to be my side occupation  and it led to a sense of failure. But actually  there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about   . And it was discovered that my brother  in       and then my father  six months later  had brain tumors. And my mother believed that something had gone wrong  and she was gonna find out what it was  and she was gonna fix it. My father was a Baptist minister  and he believed in miracles  and that God's will would take care of that. But  of course  they ended up dying  six months apart. And after that  my mother believed that it was fate  or curses    she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened. Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness. There was a reason for everything. And one of the reasons  she thought  was that her mother  who had died when she was very young  was angry at her. And so  I had this notion of death all around me  because my mother also believed that I would be next  and she would be next. And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon  you begin to think very much about everything. You become very creative  in a survival sense. And this  then  led to my big questions. And they're the same ones that I have today. And they are  why do things happen  and how do things happen  And the one my mother asked  how do I make things happen  It's a wonderful way to look at these questions  when you write a story. Because  after all  in that framework  between page one and      you have to answer this question of why things happen  how things happen  in what order they happen. What are the influences  How do I  as the narrator  as the writer  also influence that  And it's also one that  I think  many of our scientists have been asking. It's a kind of cosmology  and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe  as the creator of that universe. And you see  there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen  trying to figure it out    years and years  oftentimes. So  when I look at creativity  I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress  my looking at associations in practically anything in life. And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference  almost everything that's been going on. And so I'm going to use  as the metaphor  this association  quantum mechanics  which I really don't understand  but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor. So  in quantum mechanics  of course  you have dark energy and dark matter. And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen. There's a lot of unknown  and you often don't know what it is except by its absence. But when you make those associations  you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story  and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning. And that's what I look for in my work  a personal meaning. There is also the uncertainty principle  which is part of quantum mechanics  as I understand it.  Laughter  And this happens constantly in the writing. And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect  in which you're looking for something  and you know  things are happening simultaneously  and you're looking at it in a different way  and you're trying to really look for the about ness  or what is this story about. And if you try too hard  then you will only write the about. You won't discover anything. And what you were supposed to find  what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way  is no longer there. Now  I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe  like many of our scientists have. And so  I am going to just throw in string theory here  and just say that creative people are multidimensional  and there are    levels  I think  of anxiety. There is also a big question of ambiguity. And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant. And you don't know what is operating  but something is operating there. And ambiguity  to me  is very uncomfortable in my life  and I have it. Moral ambiguity. It is constantly there. And  just as an example  this is one that recently came to me. It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said   Save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  A very famous Chinese saying  she said. And that means because we went into Iraq  we should stay there until things were solved. You know  maybe even     years. So  there was another one that I came across  and it's  saving fish from drowning.  And it's what Buddhist fishermen say  because they're not supposed to kill anything. And they also have to make a living  and people need to be fed. So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning  and unfortunately  in the process the fish die. Now  what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors    actually  one of them is my mother's interpretation  and it is a famous Chinese saying  because she said it to me   save a man from drowning  you are responsible to him for life.  And it was a warning    don't get involved in other people's business  or you're going to get stuck. OK. I think if somebody really was drowning  she'd save them. But  both of these sayings    saving a fish from drowning  or saving a man from drowning    to me they had to do with intentions. And all of us in life  when we see a situation  we have a response. And then we have intentions. There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do  and then we do something. And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been. Maybe things go wrong. And so  after that  what are our responsibilities  What are we supposed to do  Do we stay in for life  or do we do something else and justify and say  well  my intentions were good  and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it  That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me  and led me to write a book called  Saving Fish From Drowning.  I saw examples of that. Once I identified this question  it was all over the place. I got these hints everywhere. And then  in a way  I knew that they had always been there. And then writing  that's what happens. I get these hints  these clues  and I realize that they've been obvious  and yet they have not been. And what I need  in effect  is a focus. And when I have the question  it is a focus. And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question  and what happens is those particular things become relevant. And it seems like it's happening all the time. You think there's a sort of coincidence going on  a serendipity  in which you're getting all this help from the universe. And it may also be explained that now you have a focus. And you are noticing it more often. But you apply this. You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions. Your brother  who's fallen in trouble  do you take care of him  Why or why not  It may be something that is perhaps more serious    as I said  human rights in Burma. I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said  if I did  it would show that I approved of the military regime there. And then  after a while  I had to ask myself   Why do we take on knowledge  why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us   And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up  and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father  who was a Baptist minister. So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions  and still didn't know that if I went there  what the result of that would be  if I wrote a book    and I just would have to face that later  when the time came. We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of. We come to this point and say  what do I as an individual do  Not all of us can go to Africa  or work at hospitals  so what do we do  if we have this moral response  this feeling  Also  I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at  and we talked about today  is genocide. This leads to this question. When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable  and I consider what my intentions should be  I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child    and why am I here  and what is the meaning of my life  and what is my place in the universe  It seems so obvious  and yet it is not. We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense  and yet it is also absolutely necessary. In writing a story  it is the place where I begin. Sometimes I get help from the universe  it seems. My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book  because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know. Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally  from an overdose of opium  while having too much of a good time  I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself  and that actually was the way it happened. And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother. There are also things  quite uncanny  which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book. In this case  I was writing a story that included some kind of detail  period of history  a certain location. And I needed to find something historically that would match that. And I took down this book  and I    first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting  and the time period  and the kind of character I needed    was the Taiping rebellion  happening in the area near Guilin  outside of that  and a character who thought he was the son of God. You wonder  are these things random chance  Well  what is random  What is chance  What is luck  What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain  And that goes into the story  too. These are the things I constantly think about from day to day. Especially when good things happen  and  in particular  when bad things happen. But I do think there's a kind of serendipity  and I do want to know what those elements are  so I can thank them  and also try to find them in my life. Because  again  I think that when I am aware of them  more of them happen. Another chance encounter is when I went to a place    I just was with some friends  and we drove randomly to a different place  and we ended up in this non tourist location  a beautiful village  pristine. And we walked three valleys beyond  and the third valley  there was something quite mysterious and ominous  a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be  the  setting of my book. And in writing one of the scenes  it happened in that third valley. For some reason I wrote about cairns    stacks of rocks    that a man was building. And I didn't know exactly why I had it  but it was so vivid. I got stuck  and a friend  when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs  that I said  sure. And about    minutes later  walking along the beach  I came across this. And it was a man  a Chinese man  and he was stacking these things  not with glue  not with anything. And I asked him   How is it possible to do this   And he said   Well  I guess with everything in life  there's a place of balance.  And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point. I had so many examples    I have so many instances like this  when I'm writing a story  and I cannot explain it. Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things  Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain  like the cosmological constant  A big thing that I also think about is accidents. And as I said  my mother did not believe in randomness. What is the nature of accidents  And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are  outside of a court of law  I was able to see that in a firsthand way  when I went to beautiful Dong village  in Guizhou  the poorest province of China. And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back. And I had a chance to do that  when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China. And I said yes  about this village of singing people  singing minority. And they agreed  and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went  there was a terrible accident. A man  an old man  fell asleep  and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.    homes were destroyed  and    were damaged. Responsibility was assigned to the family. The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away  in a cowshed. And  of course  as Westerners  we say   Well  it was an accident. That's not fair. It's the son  not the father.  When I go on a story  I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs. It takes a while  but I have to let go of them and just go there  and be there. And so I was there on three occasions  different seasons. And I began to sense something different about the history  and what had happened before  and the nature of life in a very poor village  and what you find as your joys  and your rituals  your traditions  your links with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice  in its responsibility. I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using  a ceremony they hadn't used in about    years. And it was to send some men    a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses. Now you  as Westerners  and I  as Westerners  would say well  that's superstition. But after being there for a while  and seeing the amazing things that happened  you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world  determining how things happen. So I remained with them  and the more I wrote that story  the more I got into those beliefs  and I think that's important for me    to take on the beliefs  because that is where the story is real  and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life. Years go by  of course  and the writing  it doesn't happen instantly  as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED. The book comes and it goes. When it arrives  it is no longer my book. It is in the hands of readers  and they interpret it differently. But I go back to this question of  how do I create something out of nothing  And how do I create my own life  And I think it is by questioning  and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths. I believe in specifics  the specifics of story  and the past  the specifics of that past  and what is happening in the story at that point. I also believe that in thinking about things    my thinking about luck  and fate  and coincidences and accidents  God's will  and the synchrony of mysterious forces    I will come to some notion of what that is  how we create. I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe  and did somebody intend for me to be that way  or is it just something I came up with  And I also can find that by imagining fully  and becoming what is imagined    and yet is in that real world  the fictional world. And that is how I find particles of truth  not the absolute truth  or the whole truth. And they have to be in all possibilities  including those I never considered before. So  there are never complete answers. Or rather  if there is an answer  it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything  and that is good  because then I will discover something new. And if there is a partial answer  a more complete answer from me  it is to simply imagine. And to imagine is to put myself in that story  until there was only    there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating. And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story    in one story    then I come the closest  I think  to knowing what compassion is  to feeling that compassion. Because for everything  in that question of how things happen  it has to do with the feeling. I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that. We've come to the end of the talk  and I will reveal what is in the bag  and it is the muse  and it is the things that transform in our lives  that are wonderful and stay with us. There she is. Thank you very much  In the year       a virtually unknown German mathematician  named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and  in some ways  a very bizarre idea. He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of. That is in addition to left  right  back  forth and up  down  Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see. Now  when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea  sometimes that's all it is    bold and bizarre  but it has nothing to do with the world around us. This particular idea  however    although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong  and at the end I'll discuss experiments which  in the next few years  may tell us whether it's right or wrong    this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research. So  I'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions. So where do we go  To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to     . This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project  to try to understand fully the grand  pervasive force of gravity. And in that moment  there are many people around who thought that that project had already been resolved. Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late     s that works well  describes the motion of planets  the motion of the moon and so forth  the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees  hitting people on the head. All of that could be described using Newton's work. But Einstein realized that Newton had left something out of the story  because even Newton had written that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity  he'd been unable to figure out how it really works. How is it that the Sun     million miles away   that  somehow it affects the motion of the Earth  How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence  And that is a task to which Einstein set himself    to figure out how gravity works. And let me show you what it is that he found. So Einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself. The idea goes like this  imagine space is a substrate of all there is. Einstein said space is nice and flat  if there's no matter present. But if there is matter in the environment  such as the Sun  it causes the fabric of space to warp  to curve. And that communicates the force of gravity. Even the Earth warps space around it. Now look at the Moon. The Moon is kept in orbit  according to these ideas  because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence. We go to a full frame view of this. The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence. That is this new idea about how gravity actually works. Now  this idea was tested in      through astronomical observations. It really works. It describes the data. And this gained Einstein prominence around the world. And that is what got Kaluza thinking. He  like Einstein  was in search of what we call a unified theory. That's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas  one set of principles  one master equation  if you will. So Kaluza said to himself  Einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space    in fact  space and time  to be more precise. Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force  which was  at that time  known as the electromagnetic force    we know of others today  but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about. You know  the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth. So Kaluza says  maybe I can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves. That raised a question  warps and curves in what  Einstein had already used up space and time  warps and curves  to describe gravity. There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve. So Kaluza said  well  maybe there are more dimensions of space. He said  if I want to describe one more force  maybe I need one more dimension. So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space  not three  and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing  when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions  not three  he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions    those were for gravity    but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension. And when he looked at that equation  it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force. Amazing    it just popped out. He was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming   Victory      that he had found the unified theory. Now clearly  Kaluza was a man who took theory very seriously. He  in fact    there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim  he read a book  a treatise on swimming       then dove into the ocean. This is a man who would risk his life on theory. Now  but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded  two questions immediately arise from his observation. Number one  if there are more dimensions in space  where are they  We don't seem to see them. And number two  does this theory really work in detail  when you try to apply it to the world around us  Now  the first question was answered in      by a fellow named Oskar Klein. He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties    there might be big  easy to see dimensions  but there might also be tiny  curled up dimensions  curled up so small  even though they're all around us  that we don't see them. Let me show you that one visually. So  imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light. It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park    it's kind of irrelevant    but the cable looks one dimensional from a distant viewpoint  but you and I all know that it does have some thickness. It's very hard to see it  though  from far away. But if we zoom in and take the perspective of  say  a little ant walking around    little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions    the long dimension  but also this clockwise  counter clockwise direction. And I hope you appreciate this. It took so long to get these ants to do this. But this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts  big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see  but there might be additional dimensions curled up  sort of like the circular part of that cable  so small that they have so far remained invisible. Let me show you what that would look like. So  if we take a look  say  at space itself    I can only show  of course  two dimensions on a screen. Some of you guys will fix that one day  but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension  goes smaller  smaller  smaller  and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself  this is the idea  you could have additional curled up dimensions    here is a little shape of a circle    so small that we don't see them. But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around  you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about    that's like the grid part    but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment. But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself  the idea is there could be more dimensions  as we see there. Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see. But what about the second question that I asked  does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world  Well  it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time  and  in detail  it didn't work. In detail  for instance  they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory. So many people worked on it  but by the '  s  certainly by the '  s  this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away. Until something wonderful happened in our age. In our era  a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself  many others around the world  it's called superstring theory  as you were indicating. And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions  but when we study superstring theory  we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling  new form. So  let me just tell you how that goes. Superstring theory    what is it  Well  it's a theory that tries to answer the question  what are the basic  fundamental  indivisible  uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us  The idea is like this. So  imagine we look at a familiar object  just a candle in a holder  and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of. So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents. So deep inside    we all know  you go sufficiently far down  you have atoms. We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story. They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons. Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks. That is where conventional ideas stop. Here is the new idea of string theory. Deep inside any of these particles  there is something else. This something else is this dancing filament of energy. It looks like a vibrating string    that's where the idea  string theory comes from. And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns  these can also vibrate in different patterns. They don't produce different musical notes. Rather  they produce the different particles making up the world around us. So if these ideas are correct  this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of the universe looks like. It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy  vibrating in different frequencies. The different frequencies produce the different particles. The different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us. And there you see unification  because matter particles  electrons and quarks  radiation particles  photons  gravitons  are all built up from one entity. So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings. And that's what we mean by a unified theory. Now here is the catch. When you study the mathematics of string theory  you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space. It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space  nor five  nor six. Finally  you can study the equations  and show that it works only in a universe that has    dimensions of space and one dimension of time. It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein    that our world  when appropriately described  has more dimensions than the ones that we see. Now you might think about that and say  well  OK  you know  if you have extra dimensions  and they're really tightly curled up  yeah  perhaps we won't see them  if they're small enough. But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there  and you make them small enough  and we won't see them either. That is true. One of the other predictions of string theory    no  that's not one of the other predictions of string theory. But it raises the question  are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions  or do they tell us something about the world  In the remaining time  I'd like to tell you two features of them. First is  many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics  theoretical science. And that question is this  when we look around the world  as scientists have done for the last hundred years  there appear to be about    numbers that really describe our universe. These are numbers like the mass of the particles  like electrons and quarks  the strength of gravity  the strength of the electromagnetic force    a list of about    numbers that have been measured with incredible precision  but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do. Now  does string theory offer an answer  Not yet. But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions. And the wonderful thing is  if those numbers had any other values than the known ones  the universe  as we know it  wouldn't exist. This is a deep question. Why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form  when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers    if I had    dials up here and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers  almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear. So can we explain those    numbers  And string theory suggests that those    numbers have to do with the extra dimensions. Let me show you how. So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory  it's not one extra dimension  as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein. This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions. They have a very rich  intertwined geometry. This is an example of something known as a Calabi Yau shape    name isn't all that important. But  as you can see  the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape  interesting structure. And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like  then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales. When you swing your hand  you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again  but they're so small that we wouldn't know it. So what is the physical implication  though  relevant to those    numbers  Consider this. If you look at the instrument  a French horn  notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument. Now in string theory  all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate. So just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument  strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving. So let me bring some strings into the story. And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around    they'll be there in a second    right there  notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions. So  if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like    we don't yet  but if we did    we should be able to calculate the allowed notes  the allowed vibrational patterns. And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns  we should be able to calculate those    numbers. And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation  this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. Now  the second issue that I want to finish up with is  how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly  Is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world  or can we actually test for these extra dimensions  And we think    and this is  I think  very exciting    that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions. Here's how it goes. In CERN  Geneva  Switzerland  a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider. It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel  opposite directions  near the speed of light. Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other  so there's a head on collision. The hope is that if the collision has enough energy  it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions  forcing it to enter into the other dimensions. How would we know it  Well  we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision  compare it to the amount of energy before  and if there's less energy after the collision than before  this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away. And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate  this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there. Let me show you that idea visually. So  imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton    that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out  if the extra dimensions are real. But here's how the experiment will go. You take these particles. You slam them together. You slam them together  and if we are right  some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions. So this is the kind of experiment that we'll be looking at in the next five  seven to    years or so. And if this experiment bears fruit  if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions than when we began  this will show that the extra dimensions are real. And to me this is a really remarkable story  and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space    didn't provide anything but an arena  a stage in which the events of the universe take place. Einstein comes along and says  well  space and time can warp and curve    that's what gravity is. And now string theory comes along and says  yes  gravity  quantum mechanics  electromagnetism  all together in one package  but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see. And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime. Amazing possibility. Thank you very much. This is the Large Hadron Collider. It's    kilometers in circumference. It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted. Over        physicists and engineers from    countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine. What we do is we accelerate protons    so  hydrogen nuclei    around   .       percent the speed of light. Right  At that speed  they go around that    kilometers        times a second. And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction. We collide them inside giant detectors. They're essentially digital cameras. And this is the one that I work on  ATLAS. You get some sense of the size    you can just see these EU standard size people underneath. You get some sense of the size     meters wide     meters in diameter        tons. And we re create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to     million times a second inside that detector    immense numbers. And if you see those metal bits there    those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles  so it can measure how fast they're traveling. This is a picture about a year ago. Those magnets are in there. And  again  a EU standard size  real person  so you get some sense of the scale. And it's in there that those mini Big Bangs will be created  sometime in the summer this year. And actually  this morning  I got an email saying that we've just finished  today  building the last piece of ATLAS. So as of today  it's finished. I'd like to say that I planned that for TED  but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today. Yeah  it's a wonderful achievement. So  you might be asking   Why  Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began   Well  particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious. And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of  and how everything sticks together. And by everything I mean  of course  me and you  the Earth  the Sun  the     billion suns in our galaxy and the     billion galaxies in the observable universe. Absolutely everything. Now you might say   Well  OK  but why not just look at it  You know  If you want to know what I'm made of  let's look at me.  Well  we found that as you look back in time  the universe gets hotter and hotter  denser and denser  and simpler and simpler. Now  there's no real reason I'm aware of for that  but that seems to be the case. So  way back in the early times of the universe  we believe it was very simple and understandable. All this complexity  all the way to these wonderful things    human brains    are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe. Back at the start  in the first billionth of a second  we believe  or we've observed  it was very simple. It's almost like ... imagine a snowflake in your hand  and you look at it  and it's an incredibly complicated  beautiful object. But as you heat it up  it'll melt into a pool of water  and you would be able to see that  actually  it was just made of H    water. So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of. And  as of today  it's made of these things. Just    particles of matter  stuck together by four forces of nature. The quarks  these pink things  are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body. The electron    the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus    held around in orbit  by the way  by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing  the photon. The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons. And these guys  here  they're the weak nuclear force  probably the least familiar. But  without it  the sun wouldn't shine. And when the sun shines  you get copious quantities of these things  called neutrinos  pouring out. Actually  if you just look at your thumbnail    about a square centimeter    there are something like    billion neutrinos per second from the sun  passing through every square centimeter of your body. But you don't feel them  because the weak force is correctly named    very short range and very weak  so they just fly through you. And these particles have been discovered over the last century  pretty much. The first one  the electron  was discovered in       and the last one  this thing called the tau neutrino  in the year     . Actually just    I was going to say  just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country  America  isn't it  Just up the road. Relative to the universe  it's just up the road. So  this thing was discovered in the year       so it's a relatively recent picture. One of the wonderful things  actually  I find  is that we've discovered any of them  when you realize how tiny they are. You know  they're a step in size from the entire observable universe. So      billion galaxies    .  billion light years away    a step in size from that to Monterey  actually  is about the same as from Monterey to these things. Absolutely  exquisitely minute  and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set. So  one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University  Ernest Rutherford  discoverer of the atomic nucleus  once said   All science is either physics or stamp collecting.  Now  I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science  although he was from New Zealand  so it's possible. But what he meant was that what we've done  really  is stamp collect there. OK  we've discovered the particles  but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern    you know  why it's built the way it is    really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science. Fortunately  we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern. It's the Newton's laws  if you want  of particle physics. It's called the standard model    beautifully simple mathematical equation. You could stick it on the front of a T shirt  which is always the sign of elegance. This is it. I've been a little disingenuous  because I've expanded it out in all its gory detail. This equation  though  allows you to calculate everything    other than gravity    that happens in the universe. So  you want to know why the sky is blue  why atomic nuclei stick together    in principle  you've got a big enough computer    why DNA is the shape it is. In principle  you should be able to calculate it from that equation. But there's a problem. Can anyone see what it is  A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me. I'll make it easier  actually  by blowing one of the lines up. Basically  each of these terms refers to some of the particles. So those Ws there refer to the Ws  and how they stick together. These carriers of the weak force  the Zs  the same. But there's an extra symbol in this equation  H. Right  H. H stands for Higgs particle. Higgs particles have not been discovered. But they're necessary  they're necessary to make that mathematics work. So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit. So it's a prediction  a prediction of a new particle. What does it do  Well  we had a long time to come up with good analogies. And back in the     s  when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government  Margaret Thatcher  at the time  said   If you guys can explain  in language a politician can understand  what the hell it is that you're doing  you can have the money. I want to know what this Higgs particle does.  And we came up with this analogy  and it seemed to work. Well  what the Higgs does is  it gives mass to the fundamental particles. And the picture is that the whole universe    and that doesn't mean just space  it means me as well  and inside you    the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field. Higgs particles  if you will. The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles. Now when a particle moves through the universe  it can interact with these Higgs particles. But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room. Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly  essentially at the speed of light. They're massless. And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room. They're surrounded by people  and their passage through the room is impeded. It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive. And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works. The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy  in a sense  and massive  because they're surrounded by Higgs particles. They're interacting with the Higgs field. If that picture's true  then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC. If it's not true    because it's quite a convoluted mechanism  although it's the simplest we've been able to think of    then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC. So  that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine. I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher. Actually  I thought about making it more culturally relevant  but    anyway. So that's one thing. That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find. There are many other things. You've heard many of the big problems in particle physics. One of them you heard about  dark matter  dark energy. There's another issue  which is that the forces in nature    it's quite beautiful  actually    seem  as you go back in time  they seem to change in strength. Well  they do change in strength. So  the electromagnetic force  the force that holds us together  gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures. The strong force  the strong nuclear force  which sticks nuclei together  gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model    you can calculate how these change    is the forces  the three forces  other than gravity  almost seem to come together at one point. It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super force  back at the beginning of time. But they just miss. Now there's a theory called super symmetry  which doubles the number of particles in the standard model  which  at first sight  doesn't sound like a simplification. But actually  with this theory  we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together  back at the Big Bang    absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that  but it seems to do it. Also  those super symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter. So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics. And if I was to put money on it  I would put money on    in a very unscientific way    that that these things would also crop up at the LHC. Many other things that the LHC could discover. But in the last few minutes  I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think    what particle physics really means to me    particle physics and cosmology. And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative    almost a creation story  if you'd like    about the universe  from modern science over the last few decades. And I'd say that it deserves  in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk  to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north. This is a creation story  I think  equally as wonderful. The story goes like this  we know that the universe began   .  billion years ago  in an immensely hot  dense state  much smaller than a single atom. It began to expand about a million  billion  billion  billion billionth of a second    I think I got that right    after the Big Bang. Gravity separated away from the other forces. The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation. In about the first billionth of a second or so  the Higgs field kicked in  and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass. The universe continued to expand and cool. After about a few minutes  there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all. The universe was about    percent hydrogen     percent helium. It still is today. It continued to expand about     million years. Then light began to travel through the universe. It was big enough to be transparent to light  and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God. After about     million years  the first stars formed  and that hydrogen  that helium  then began to cook into the heavier elements. So the elements of life    carbon  and oxygen and iron  all the elements that we need to make us up    were cooked in those first generations of stars  which then ran out of fuel  exploded  threw those elements back into the universe. They then re collapsed into another generation of stars and planets. And on some of those planets  the oxygen  which had been created in that first generation of stars  could fuse with hydrogen to form water  liquid water on the surface. On at least one  and maybe only one of those planets  primitive life evolved  which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania  and eventually left a footprint on another world. And built this civilization  this wonderful picture  that turned the darkness into light  and you can see the civilization from space. As one of my great heroes  Carl Sagan  said  these are the things    and actually  not only these  but I was looking around    these are the things  like Saturn V rockets  and Sputnik  and DNA  and literature and science    these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given   .  billion years. Absolutely remarkable. And  the laws of physics. Right  So  the right laws of physics    they're beautifully balanced. If the weak force had been a little bit different  then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars  and there would be none of that in the universe. And I think that's a wonderful and significant story.    years ago  I couldn't have told that story  because we didn't know it. It makes me really feel that that civilization    which  as I say  if you believe the scientific creation story  has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics  and a few hydrogen atoms    then I think  to me anyway  it makes me feel incredibly valuable. So that's the LHC. The LHC is certainly  when it turns on in summer  going to write the next chapter of that book. And I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on.

I am wearing the Al Gore in ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine. But I guess that's in keeping  so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation  ladies and gentlemen. This is a brand new song. In the spirit of TED  we're bringing you something that has not been released. John  do you want to introduce the song  This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature. It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.   Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     You can't walk  you can't ramble     'cause you're gonna have to scramble     from the bee of the bird of the moth.     Catbird is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal      to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth     defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like the bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Got a brand new shipment     of electrical equipment     it's addressed to the bottom of the sea.     Send a tangerine colored     nuclear submarine     with a sticker that says STP.     Windshield wiper washer fluid     spraying in the air ...     headlights under head lice     under hats lie everywhere.     Subatomic waves     to the underwater caves     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Now the moth defeats the mouse and man.     It's messing with the plan.     It can't be believed     'cause it's just a hummingbird moth     who's acting like a bird     that thinks it's a bee.     Is it us or is this messed up      Everyone's deforming     in the presence of the swarming     of the bee of the bird of the moth.     Protozoa  snakes and horses     have enlisted in the forces     of the bee of bird of the moth.     Catbug is a cat     but he's got bugness in his veins.     Manhouse lives within himself     with thoughtful human brains.     Neither one is equal     to the challenge of the freak we'll call     the bee of the bird of the moth.   Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. So we are past our      th show. Probably somewhere around      . It's hard to know. We've only done two shows in      so far  but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had. It was    degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed. So thank you. We are cultural test pilots  ladies and gentlemen. How early can a rock performance begin  Not all the facts are in about performing at  .   in the morning. I can tell you the    degree thing was fantastic. All right. So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence. This song is called  Asbury Park.  It's based on a real life experience.   I     I got     I got kicked     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     I got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer wasn't me.     Me got     Me got kicked     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone.     Stone Pone.     Stone Pony.     Me got kicked in the head     backstage at the Stone Pony     where I swore to the guy     that the guy who took his beer     was a guy dressed like me.     Not me      Not me      Not me    Thank you. Marty Beller on the drums over there. We want to get in as many songs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play. This song is called  Fingertips.    Everything is catching on fire     Yes  everything is catching on fire     Yes  everything is catching on fire.

What's that blue thing doing here      Something grabbed ahold of my hand     I didn't know what had my hand     but that's when all my troubles began.     I don't understand you     I don't understand you     I cannot understand you     I cannot understand you     I don't understand the things you say     I can't understand a single word     I don't understand you     I don't understand you     I just don't understand you     I don't understand you     I do not understand you     Don't understand you     Don't understand you     I turn around     See the sound     Turn around and see the thing     that made the sound.

We're taking calls    from the dead.     We're taking phone calls from the dead.     They're calling from beyond the grave.     Beyond the grave.     They have some questions     And things to share     From underneath the cold  cold ground.   We're soliciting phone calls from dead people as a special TED presentation. We're taking calls live on stage here at TED in Monterey. And I think we have a caller coming in here. Hello there. You're live. Hello. Who's there  please  Am I on the air  Hi there. You're on with They Might Be Giants. This is Eleanor Roosevelt. Hello  Eleanor  please ... I want to talk to ... Please turn off your radio  Eleanor. I wanna talk to Randi. I've got a question for Randi. What's your question  please  I want to talk to the Amazing Randi. Do you have a laminated badge  Eleanor  I want my million dollars. Eleanor  I'm sorry  do you have a laminated badge  No  I don't have a badge. Well  I think we're going to stop that part of the show. Here's a song we like to think of as the future anthem of TED. It's actually a children's song but like so many projects for children it's really just a Trojan horse for adult work. This song is called  The Alphabet ...

Have a great session. Thank you all. You know  one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that I'm really here by accident. And what I mean    not at TED    that I'm    at this point in my life  truly my set of circumstances I would truly consider an accident. But what I'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often. Because I really think  when I look back at how I actually ended up in this accident  technology played a big role in that. So  what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself  because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you. And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education. And once I put that in context  I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology  why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler  a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges. Then  about the initiative that Chris mentioned  that we decided to launch at AMD that we call   x  . And then I'll come back to the beginning  and tell you a little bit more    hopefully convince you    that I believe that in today's world  it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about  but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. So  with that in mind  first of all let me tell you  I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest  the other four are women. So I grew up in a family of women. I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world. And  as you can imagine  if you can picture this  I was born in a very small village in Mexico  in  unfortunately  very poor surroundings  and my parents did not have a college education. But I was fortunate to be able to have one  and so were my four sisters. That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education. My parents were fanatics about learning  and I'll come back to that a little bit later. But one of the things that exposed me early to learning  and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child  was through a technology which is on the screen    is a Victrola. My father found that in a junkyard  and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow    to this day  I frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world    but  by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old  and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart  and he would tell me how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever  and how Claire de Lune  which was one of his favorites  was a real exposure to me to classical music. He explained to me about Johann Strauss  and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world. And would tell me a little bit about history too  when he'd play the      Overture by Tchaikovsky on this little Victrola  and he would tell me about Russia and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times and why this music  in some way  represented a little bit of that history. And even as a child  he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity. And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech  but if you can imagine the time when this occurred    it was in the mid '  s    this was really  in his view  a pretty piece of high tech. Well  one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that  people ask me and say   Well  how did your parents treat you when you were a child   And I always said that they were really tough on me. And not tough in the sense that most people think of  where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever. They were tough in the sense that  as I grew up  both my mother and father would always say to me  it's really important that you always remember two things. First of all  when you go to bed at night  you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something  and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could. And the second thing they said  and we trust you  that no matter where you are or where you go  you will always do the right thing. Now  I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids  but if you do  please trust me  it's the most pressure you can put on a child  to say       we trust you that you will always do the right thing. When I was out with my friends drinking beer  I always was very aware of those words       and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful  of course  but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible  and it can only be helpful if it's affordable. And in today's world  being useful  affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today. So  one of our passions in our company  and now one of my personal passions  is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful  accessible and affordable. And to me  that is very  very critical. Now  technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days. You know  we now have  of course  incredibly powerful computers. A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet. Although frankly speaking  we don't believe the Internet is the killer app. What we believe is that the Internet  frankly  is a connection of people and ideas. The Internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected. And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome. And so  we believe that through all the changes that have occurred  that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity. If we can connect people and ideas more intensely    and although you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today  the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity  in a useful way  accessibility  in an easy manner  and also affordability  that regardless of the economic status that a person could have  that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology. So  when you look at that  we said  well  we would like to  then  enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative. And a couple of years ago at AMD  we came up with this idea of saying  what if we create this initiative we call   x    where we are going to aim  that by the year       half of the world will be connected to the Internet so that people and ideas can get connected. We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves  and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone. We always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments  industry  educational institutions  a myriad of other companies and  frankly  even competitors. So  it is really a rather lofty initiative  if you want to think that way  but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead  that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently. And I'll come back to that in a minute  because I think the results so far have been remarkable  and I can only anticipate and get real excited about what I think is going to happen in the next eight years  while we get to the      initiative. Where are we today  That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com. Those of you who've never looked at their website  you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see how the Internet penetration has changed over the years. And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well  where are we related to our goal towards       the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces. One is the Western world  defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States  has made an awful lot of progress. The connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase. As a matter of fact  we think reaching     percent is very doable  even before the      timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries  such as India and China  the progress has been good    has been solid  has been good. But in places that are not as developed  places like Africa  Latin America and other places in the world  the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact  I was just recently visiting South Africa. I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki  and one of the things that we talked about is  what is it that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster  And one of the reasons is  in South Africa  it costs     dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity. It is impossible  even in the United States  for that cost  to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach. So  we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down. So  when you look at this chart  you look at the very last    it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale    you look at the very end  we've got quite a long way to go to get to the      goal of    percent. But we're excited in our company  we're motivated. We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things  to force us to do things differently  and we look forward to being able to actually  working with so many partners around the world  to be able to reach that goal. Now  one of the things I'd like to explain  about    x    which I think is really critical  is that it is not a charity. It is actually a business venture. Let's take a small segment of this  of this unconnected world  and call it the education market. When you look at elementary school children  we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the Internet. Therefore  when we see that  we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment. And when we embarked in this initiative  from the very beginning we said it very clearly  this is not a charity. This is really a business venture  one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market. Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market  whether it's education or under developed nations  either way  it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality  incredibly high reliability  tremendous low cost and access  and a lot of challenges that frankly  without actually doing it  it would be very difficult to understand  and I'll explain that in just a minute. It is an initiative that is focused on simple  accessible and human centric solutions. What we mean by that is  you know  frankly  the PC was invented in       roughly speaking more or less  and for    odd years  it hasn't changed. It is still  in most places  a gray or black box  and it looks the same. And frankly    and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this  but I truly mean it    if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it  it would be very difficult to judge who made it  because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different. So  there has not been a human centric approach to addressing this segment of the market  so we really believe it is critical to think of it. It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning  about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa. We're talking about something very similar here. And it has to be based on a geo sensitive approach. What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world  the government plays a key role in the development of technology. In other parts  it doesn't. In other parts of the world  you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place. In other parts  it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions. And the last piece  which is really important    and this is an opinion that we have  not shared by many  this is one where we seem to stand alone  on this one    is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local  integrated  end to end ecosystems. What I mean by that  and let me use this example  the country of South Africa  because I was just there  therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have. It's a country of    million people. It's an economy that's emerging. It's beginning to grow tremendously. They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity. They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa. They're developing a software training environment in their universities. What a place  what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools. And to my surprise  I learned in South Africa they have    dialects  I always thought they only had two    English and Afrikaans    but it turns out they have    dialects. And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system  it could only be done from inside. I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world  and just dumping product and selling into the markets. So  we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large  and there's an infrastructure that can provide it  that a local  integrated  end to end system is really critical for its success. This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in Mexico  in my home country. This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan. Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico    Michoacan is a very colorful state. Children dress with very colorful  colorful clothes  and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids  in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids. We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the West Cape in South Africa  in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School  and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers  it's just phenomenal. And recently  they've written us letters  telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives  on their educational dreams  on their capabilities  and it's just phenomenal. We have now deployed    different technologists in    different countries  and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands. And I have to tell you that although millions doesn't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected  it's a start. And we are learning a lot. And we're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective. One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child. Some of you are familiar with this. This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies    Google is involved  Red Hat    and AMD is a key player. The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology  it's a microprocessor. But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be  one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a    hour battery life. Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours  and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it. The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part  and battery life on this product is now    hours    just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this. We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year  and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education. It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market  not only in the developing countries  but actually in the developed regions as well  because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. We also have partnered with TED in this project  with Architecture for Humanity  and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair  we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region. And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this  and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting  exciting activity. Let me come back to the beginning  to end this presentation. I'll tell you that one of the things that I feel is really critical for us in industry  in business  is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems. I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet  and look at numbers and say  yes  that's a good business. I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. And one of the things that I learned  too  from my parents    and I'll give you a little anecdote    especially from my father. And it took me a while to understand it  but he said to me  when I went to college  he said   You're the first person in the family to go to college. And it's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress  each generation has to do better than the last one. And therefore  this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.  Frankly  I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time. I was eager to go off to college  and go find girls  and study  and girls  and study  but then I finished college and I fell in love. I graduated. I decided to get married. And on my wedding day  my father came to me again and said   You know  I'm going to remind you again  that each generation has to do better than the last one. You have to be a better husband than I was  because that's how you make progress.  And now he began to make sense. Because I knew what a great husband he was  and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me  like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later  I had a child  my first child  and again  my father comes to the hospital  and we're looking at the glass  and see all the children on the other side  and he said   I've got to remind you again  that for each generation to do better  you're going to have to be a better father than I was.  That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me  because he was a great father. But the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better  to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune     company. It's got to be that someday I can look back  and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make. Thank you very much. I love a challenge  and saving the Earth is probably a good one. We all know the Earth is in trouble. We have now entered in the  X  the sixth major extinction on this planet. I often wondered  if there was a United Organization of Organisms    otherwise known as  Uh Oh     would we be voted on the planet  or off the planet  I think that vote is occurring right now. I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions  using fungi  and these solutions are based on mycelium. The mycelium infuses all landscapes  it holds soils together  it's extremely tenacious. This holds up to        times its mass. They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature    the soil magicians. They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth. We have now discovered that there is a multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants  mitigated by the mcyelium    so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks  cedars and Douglas firs. Dusty and I  we like to say  on Sunday  this is where we go to church. I'm in love with the old growth forest  and I'm a patriotic American because we have those. Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms. And frankly  I face a big obstacle. When I mention mushrooms to somebody  they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms  their eyes glaze over  and they think I'm a little crazy. So  I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group. We call it mycophobia  the irrational fear of the unknown  when it comes to fungi. Mushrooms are very fast in their growth. Day     day     day   . Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics. In fact  we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom. A group of    eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta    a super kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together. We share in common the same pathogens. Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria  and so our best antibiotics come from fungi. But here is a mushroom that's past its prime. After they sporulate  they do rot. But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest. They give rise to the trees  they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium. And so we see a mushroom here sporulating. And the spores are germinating  and the mycelium forms and goes underground. In a single cubic inch of soil  there can be more than eight miles of these cells. My foot is covering approximately     miles of mycelium. This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey. And notice that as the mycelium grows  it conquers territory and then it begins the net. I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years  I have thousands of electron micrographs  and when I'm staring at the mycelium  I realize that they are microfiltration membranes. We exhale carbon dioxide  so does mycelium. It inhales oxygen  just like we do. But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs. And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes. And in these cavities  these micro cavities form  and as they fuse soils  they absorb water. These are little wells. And inside these wells  then microbial communities begin to form. And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion  but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms. I first proposed  in the early     s  that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet. When you look at the mycelium  they're highly branched. And if there's one branch that is broken  then very quickly  because of the nodes of crossing    Internet engineers maybe call them hot points    there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information. The mycelium is sentient. It knows that you are there. When you walk across landscapes  it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris. So  I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven  biologically successful model. The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit  and we now  being the top organism on this planet  are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere. Going way out  dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype. I believe matter begets life  life becomes single cells  single cells become strings  strings become chains  chains network. And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe. Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land. They came to land  .  billion years ago  and plants followed several hundred million years later. How is that possible  It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids  and many other acids and enzymes  pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates. Makes the rocks crumble  and the first step in the generation of soil. Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together. So  fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates. And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix. This was first discovered in     . This is a photograph by Franz Hueber. This photograph's taken     s in Saudi Arabia.     million years ago  this organism existed. It was called Prototaxites. Prototaxites  laying down  was about three feet tall. The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet. Dr. Boyce  at the University of Chicago  published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus  a giant mushroom. Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms. All across most land masses. And these existed for tens of millions of years. Now  we've had several extinction events  and as we march forward       million years ago    most of you know about it    we had an asteroid impact. The Earth was struck by an asteroid  a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere. Sunlight was cut off  and fungi inherited the Earth. Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded  because fungi do not need light. More recently  at Einstein University  they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy  much like plants use light. So  the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere  I think  is a forgone conclusion  at least in my own mind. The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon. I couldn't miss it. It was       acres in size        acres in size        years old. The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat  one cell wall thick. How is it that this organism can be so large  and yet be one cell wall thick  whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us  The mycelium  in the right conditions  produces a mushroom    it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt. We were involved with several experiments. I'm going to show you six  if I can  solutions for helping to save the world. Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham  Washington. There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste  one was a control pile  one pile was treated with enzymes  one pile was treated with bacteria  and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium. The mycelium absorbs the oil. The mycelium is producing enzymes    peroxidases    that break carbon hydrogen bonds. These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together. So  the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil  and then  when we returned six weeks later  all the tarps were removed  all the other piles were dead  dark and stinky. We came back to our pile  it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms  and the color changed to a light form. The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates    fungal sugars. Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms. They're very large. They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained. But something else happened  which was an epiphany in my life. They sporulated  the spores attract insects  the insects laid eggs  eggs became larvae. Birds then came  bringing in seeds  and our pile became an oasis of life. Whereas the other three piles were dead  dark and stinky  and the PAH's    the aromatic hydrocarbons    went from        parts per million to less than     in eight weeks. The last image we don't have. The entire pile was a green berm of life. These are gateway species  vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities. So I invented burlap sacks  bunker spawn    and putting the mycelium    using storm blown debris  you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E. coli  or other wastes  or a factory with chemical toxins  and it leads to habitat restoration. So  we set up a site in Mason County  Washington  and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms. And I'll show you a graph here. This is a logarithmic scale     to the eighth power. There's more than a     million colonies per gram  and    to the third power is around      . In    hours to    hours  these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria        times. Think of the implications. This is a space conservative method that uses storm debris    and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year. So  this one mushroom  in particular  has drawn our interest over time. This is my wife Dusty  with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis    Agarikon. It's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that Dioscorides first described in    A.D. as a treatment against consumption. This mushroom grows in Washington State  Oregon  northern California  British Columbia  now thought to be extinct in Europe. May not seem that large    let's get closer. This is extremely rare fungus. Our team    and we have a team of experts that go out    we went out    times in the old growth forest last year. We found one sample to be able to get into culture. Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health. I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program. We submitted over     samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water  and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites. And a few years ago  we received these results. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses. Dr. Earl Kern  who's a smallpox expert of the U.S. Defense Department  states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.    or greater are considered to be very active. Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range. There's a vetted press release that you can read    it's vetted by DOD    if you Google  Stamets  and  smallpox.  Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview. So  encouraged by this  naturally we went to flu viruses. And so  for the first time  I am showing this. We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses. Here's the selectivity index numbers    against pox  you saw   s and   s    now against flu viruses  compared to the ribavirin controls  we have an extraordinarily high activity. And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical. We tried it against flu A viruses    H N   H N     as well as flu B viruses. So then we tried a blend  and in a blend combination we tried it against H N   and we got greater than       selectivity index. I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense. I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi    fungi that kill insects. Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants. So  I went to the EPA homepage  and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants  as well as termites. I did something that nobody else had done. I actually chased the mycelium  when it stopped producing spores. These are spores    this is in their spores. I was able to morph the culture into a non sporulating form. And so the industry has spent over     million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house. But the insects aren't stupid  and they would avoid the spores when they came close  and so I morphed the cultures into a non sporulating form. And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish  I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields  every day  in my house  and the ants were attracted to the mycelium  because there's no spores. They gave it to the queen. One week later  I had no sawdust piles whatsoever. And then    a delicate dance between dinner and death    the mycelium is consumed by the ants  they become mummified  and  boing  a mushroom pops out of their head. Now after sporulation  the spores repel. So  the house is no longer suitable for invasion. So  you have a near permanent solution for reinvasion of termites. And so my house came down  I received my first patent against carpenter ants  termites and fire ants. Then we tried extracts  and lo and behold  we can steer insects to different directions. This has huge implications. I then received my second patent    and this is a big one. It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent. It covers over         species. This is the most disruptive technology    I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry    that they have ever witnessed. This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world. You could fly     Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept  because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi  prior to sporulation  attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores. And so I came up with a Life Box  because I needed a delivery system. The Life Box    you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference    you add soil  you add water  you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores  like of the Agarikon mushroom. The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium. And then you put tree seeds in here  and then you end up growing    potentially    an old growth forest from a cardboard box. I want to reinvent the delivery system  and the use of cardboard around the world  so they become ecological footprints. If there's a YouTube like site that you could put up  you could make it interactive  zip code specific    where people could join together  and through satellite imaging systems  through Virtual Earth or Google Earth  you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes. You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes  you could add water    I developed this for the refugee community    corns  beans and squash and onions. I took several containers    my wife said  if I could do this  anybody could    and I ended up growing a seed garden. Then you harvest the seeds    and thank you  Eric Rasmussen  for your help on this    and then you're harvesting the seed garden. Then you can harvest the kernels  and then you just need a few kernels. I add mycelium to it  and then I inoculate the corncobs. Now  three corncobs  no other grain    lots of mushrooms begin to form. Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank  and so this population will be shut down. But watch what happens here. The mushrooms then are harvested  but very importantly  the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars. And so I thought  how could we address the energy crisis in this country  And we came up with Econol. Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary    and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already. But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent  and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels. So  we build the carbon banks on the planet  renew the soils. These are a species that we need to join with. I think engaging mycelium can help save the world. Thank you very much. What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter  and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea. And in particular  I want to talk about the design of diarrhea. And when evolutionary biologists talk about design  they really mean design by natural selection. And that brings me to the title of the talk   Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.  And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this. But I'm not just doing this to be cute. I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me  who's sort of a Darwin wannabe  how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine. It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists. You actually see a great potential  but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf  and may actually be very resistant  when one tries to introduce ideas. So  all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions. One is that  why are some disease organisms more harmful  And a very closely related question  which is  how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question  How can we make the harmful organisms more mild  And I'm going to be talking  to begin with  as I said  about diarrheal disease organisms. And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms  as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease  is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view  germ's eye view. And in particular  to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms. And that idea is that from the germ's eye point of view  disease organisms have to get from one host to another  and often they have to rely on the well being of the host to move them to another host. But not always. Sometimes  you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission. And when you have that  then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative  more predator like organisms. So  natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage. If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility  then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms. So  if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active  and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts  the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success. But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen  then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners. So  I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases. Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways. They can be transmitted from person to person contact  person to food then to person contact  when somebody eats contaminated food  or they can be transmitted through the water. And when they're transmitted through the water  unlike the first two modes of transmission  these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission. A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens  even hundreds of other individuals. To sort of illustrate that  this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed  somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials. They're going to wash those contaminated materials  and then the water may move into sources of drinking water. People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water  bring things back to the family  may drink right at that point. The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals. And so  the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water  we expect them to be more predator like  more harmful. And you can test these ideas. So  one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria  and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water  tend to be more harmful. And the answer is    yep  they are. Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs  but the main point here is that    there's a lot of them here  I can tell    the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong  positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water  and how harmful they are  how much death they cause per untreated infection. So this suggests we're on the right track. But this  to me  suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions. Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was  how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild  Now  this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission  you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph. But it doesn't tell you how long. I mean  if this would require thousands of years  then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens. But if it could occur in just a few years  then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control. In other words  this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms. We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us. And so  as I was thinking about this  I focused on this organism  which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae. And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera. And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful. It's harmful because it produces a toxin  and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract. It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen  the internal chamber of our intestine  and then that fluid goes the only way it can  which is out the other end. And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios. So what happens  if you've got an organism  it produces a lot of toxin. After a few days of infection you end up having    the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine. It's sort of cloudy water. And if you took a drop of that water  you might find a million diarrheal organisms. If the organism produced a lot of toxin  you might find    million  or     million. If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin  then you might find a smaller number. So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission  thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person to person contact  or person food person contact    both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission. Now  I can think of some possible experiments. One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism    some that produce a lot of toxins  some that produce a little    and take those strains and spew them out in different countries. Some countries that might have clean water supplies  so that you can't get waterborne transmission  you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there. Other countries  in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission  there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness  right  There's a little ethical problem in this experiment. I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least. That makes me worry a little bit. But anyhow  the laughter makes me feel a little bit better. And this ethical problem's a big problem. Just to emphasize this  this is what we're really talking about. Here's a girl who's almost dead. She got rehydration therapy  she perked up  within a few days she was looking like a completely different person. So  we don't want to run an experiment like that. But interestingly  just that thing happened in     . In       this cholera organism got into Lima  Peru  and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas. Now  I don't know how that happened  and I didn't have anything to do with it  I promise you. I don't think anybody knows  but I'm not averse to  once that's happened  to see whether or not the prediction that we would make  that I did make before  actually holds up. Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile  which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America  And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador  which has some of the least well protected  And Peru's got something sort of in between. And so  with funding from the Bosack Kruger Foundation  I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab. And we found that in Chile    within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile    and when you look at those strains  in the very far left hand side of this graph  you see a lot of variation in the toxin production. Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person    a lot of variation on which natural selection can act. But the interesting point is  if you look over the     s  within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild. They evolved to produce less toxin. And to just give you a sense of how important this might be  if we look in       we find that there's only one case of cholera  on average  reported from Chile every two years. So  it's controlled. That's how much we have in America  cholera that's acquired endemically  and we don't think we've got a problem here. They didn't    they solved the problem in Chile. But  before we get too confident  we'd better look at some of those other countries  and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness. Well  in Peru it didn't. And in Ecuador    remember  this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission    it looked like it got more harmful. In every case there's a lot of variation  but something about the environment the people are living in  and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's the degree of waterborne transmission  favored the harmful strains in one place  and mild strains in another. So  this is very encouraging  it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow  if we had enough money  could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck. It would make these organisms evolve to mildness  so that even though people might be getting infected  they'd be infected with mild strains. It wouldn't be causing severe disease. But there's another really interesting aspect of this  and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence  evolution of harmfulness  then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance. And the idea is very simple. If you've got a harmful organism  a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic  a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics. You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance  so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance. And once you get increased antibiotic resistance  the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore. So  you've got a higher level of virulence. So  you get this vicious cycle. The goal is to turn this around. If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply  you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance. So  we can go to the same countries and look and see. Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance  whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem  If we look in the beginning of the     s  we see  again  a lot of variation. In this case  on the Y axis  we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity    and I won't go into that. But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile  Peru and Ecuador  and no trend across the years. But if we look at the end of the     s  just half a decade later  we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem. Antibiotic sensitivity was going down. And in Chile  you still had antibiotic sensitivity. So  it looks like Chile dodged two bullets. They got the organism to evolve to mildness  and they got no development of antibiotic resistance. Now  these ideas should apply across the board  as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence. And I want to give you just one more example  because we've talked a little bit about malaria. And the example I want to deal with is  or the idea I want to deal with  the question is  what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness  Now  malaria's transmitted by a mosquito  and normally if you're infected with malaria  and you're feeling sick  it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you. And you can show  just by looking at data from literature  that vector borne diseases are more harmful than non vector borne diseases. But I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this. In the case of waterborne transmission  we'd like to clean up the water supplies  see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness. In the case of malaria  what we'd like to do is mosquito proof houses. And the logic's a little more subtle here. If you mosquito proof houses  when people get sick  they're sitting in bed    or in mosquito proof hospitals  they're sitting in a hospital bed    and the mosquitoes can't get to them. So  if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito proof housing  then you're a loser. The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites. So  if you were to mosquito proof houses  you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness. And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this. And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama. Just to give you a little perspective on this  I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States  which is right there in Louisville  Kentucky. And this really cool experiment was done about     miles south of there  in Northern Alabama  by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They had dammed up the Tennessee River. They'd caused the water to back up  they needed electric  hydroelectric power. And when you get stagnant water  you get mosquitoes. They found in the late '  s       years after they'd made these dams    that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria  about a third to half of them were infected with malaria. This shows you the positions of some of these dams. OK  so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind. There wasn't DDT  there wasn't chloroquines  what do they do  Well  they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama. So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into    zones  and within three years  about     dollars per house  they mosquito proofed every house. And these are the data. Every row across here represents one of those    zones. And the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete. And so what you can see is that just the mosquito proofed housing  and nothing else  caused the eradication of malaria. And this was  incidentally  published in       in the leading textbook of malaria  called  Boyd's Malariology.  But almost no malaria experts even know it exists. This is important  because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities  you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses. Now  I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places. Like  you know  just as you get into the malaria zone  sub Saharan Africa. But as you move to really intense biting rate areas  like Nigeria  you're certainly not going to eradicate. But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness. So to me  it's an experiment that's waiting to happen  and if it confirms the prediction  then we should have a very powerful tool. In a way  much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at  because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs. And we know that  although it's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency  we know that when you make them highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs. And so it's a short term solution. This is a long term solution. What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go  rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen  for example with anti malarial drugs. So  this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples. But as I said earlier  this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases  and it ought to. Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases  we're dealing with living systems. We're dealing with living systems  we're dealing with systems that evolve. And so if you do something with those systems  they're going to evolve one way or another. And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve  so that    we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck  so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. So  I don't really have time to talk about those things  but I did want to put them up there  just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with. And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about. So  for example  earlier today there was discussion of  how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV  What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work. Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area  It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners  and so on. But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it  because if we lower it  we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus. And the data really do support this  that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness. And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts. So the other thing I really like about this  besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease  is that often the kinds of interventions that you want  that it indicates should be done  are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow. But people just haven't been able to justify the cost. So  this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water  then I think that we can say  let's push the effort into that aspect of the control  so that we can actually solve the problem  even though  if you just look at the frequency of infection  you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply. Anyhow  I'll end that there  and thank you very much. I started juggling a long time ago  but long before that  I was a golfer  and that's what I was  a golfer. And as a golfer and as a kid  one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores  that I sort of lived my whole life  is process. And it's the process of learning things. One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer  but he was lefty. And he had a real passion for golf  and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things. Well  I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time  but grew to know stuff about. And that was the mythology of skill. So  one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill. And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music    I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab    it relates a lot to music. But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere  I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought  or not. But I'm going to explore skill  and juggling  and basically visual music  I guess. OK  you can start the music  thanks. Thanks. Thank you. Now  juggling can be a lot of fun  play with skill and play with space  play with rhythm. And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces. I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it. Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands    because a lot of juggling is hand oriented    but using the rhythm of my body and feet  and controlling the balls with my feet. Thanks. Now  this next section was an attempt to explore space. You see  I think Richard said something about people that are against something. Well  a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff. Well  I kind of  from my childhood and golf and all that  it's a process of joining with forces. And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique. So juggling gravity    up  down. If you figure out what up and down really are  it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything  but then you add in sideways. Now  I look at it somewhat as a way    when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes  and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands  you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience. So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm  with the obvious reference to the feet  but it's also time    where the feet were  where the balls were. Thanks. So  visual music  rhythm and complexity. I'm going to build towards complexity now. Juggling three balls is simple and normal. Excuse me. We're jugglers  OK. And remember  you're transposing  you're getting into a subculture here. And juggling    the balls cross and all that. OK  if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights  but then hopefully even rhythm. And you can change the rhythm    good  Michael. You can change the rhythm  if you get out of the lights. OK  Change the rhythm  so it's even. Or you can go back and change the height. Now  skill. But you're boxed in  if you can only do it up and down that way. So  you've got to go after the space down there. OK  then you've got to combine them  because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you. And then you get crazy. Now  I'm actually going to ask you to try something  so you've got to pay attention. Complexity  if you spend enough time doing something  time slows down or your skill increases  so your perceptions change. It's learning skills    like being in a high speed car crash. Things slow down as you learn  as you learn  as you learn. You may not be able to affect it  it almost drifts on you. It goes. But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. So  complexity. Now  how many here are jugglers  OK  so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this. OK  And whoever laughed there    you understood it completely  right  No  it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there  who's got his hands around that mess  OK. Well  that's what juggling is about  right  It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand. All right. So  that's one way of doing it  which is five balls down. OK  Another way is the outside. And you could play with the rhythm. Same pattern. Make it faster and smaller. Make it wider. Make it narrower. Bring it back up. OK. It's done. Thanks. Now  what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright  very tactile. I have no idea how computer oriented or three dimensionally oriented you are  but let's try something. OK  so since you all don't understand what the five ball pattern is  I'm going to give you a little clue. Enough of a clue  So  you get the pattern  right  OK. You're not getting off that easy. All right  Now  do me a favor  follow the ball that I ask you to follow. Green. Yellow. Pink. White. OK  you can do that  Yeah  OK. Now  let's actually learn something. Actually  let me put you in that area of learning  which is very insecure. You want to do it  Yeah  OK. Hands out in front of you. Palms up  together. What you're going to learn is this. OK  So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it. Index finger  middle finger  ring  little. Little  ring  middle  index. And then open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. A little bit faster. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here. One learning process that I see is this    OK. Another learning process that I see is this    OK. So  everybody take a deep breath in  breath out. OK. Now  one more time  and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Open. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. OK. Shake your hands out. Now  I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer. OK  So  what you're doing is  you're going la  la  la  and you're getting this. OK  So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do  but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it. So what I want you to do is    fingers. I'll tell you what to do with your fingers  same thing. But I want you to do is also  with your eyes  is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow. OK  Here we go. So  we're going to start off looking at the white ball    and I'm going to tell you which color  and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK  So white ball and    finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Pink. Finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. Green. Finger  finger  finger  finger. Yellow. Finger  finger  finger  pink or finger. Pink  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger  finger. All right. How did you do  Well  OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives  a moment of learning  a moment of challenge. It's a moment that you can't make sense of. Why the hell should I learn this  OK  Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life  You know  I can't decipher    is it fun  Is it challenging  Am I supposed to cheat  You know  what are you supposed to do  You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life. OK  Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere  It's just a moment. That's all it is  a moment. OK  I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this. I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment. There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that  a moment. And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects. What I've done for you here  I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together  but they're not original techniques. Now  I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed. OK  So  a moment  how would you define a moment  Well  as a juggler  what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment. Ahhh. All right  I'm going to get on my knees and do it. So  a moment. OK  And then  what I did as a juggler was say  OK  what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else  another dynamic. So  a moment. Another moment. Excuse me  still getting there. A moment that travels. A moment    no  we'll try that again. It separates  and comes back together. Time. How can you look at time  And what do you dedicate it to  in exploring a particular thing  Well  obviously  there's something in here  and you can all have a guess as to what it is. There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment. And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else. And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. Now  this has expanded into a much bigger piece  because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this. But I just thought I'd talk about a moment. All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle  Are we ready to do that  Yes  This is the piece that I told you about. It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle. Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is  you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at     miles an hour  The only other thing is  it was a real shock. I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car  it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting. Anyway  balance  constant movement to find an approach to stillness. Cheating. Balance  making up the rules so you can't cheat  so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body. To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. Hup. Now  it's dependent on rhythm  and keeping a center of balance. When it falls  going underneath. So  there's a rhythm to it. The rhythm can get much smaller. As your skill increases  you learn to find those tinier spaces  those tinier movements. Thanks. Now  I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways  and also    oh  actually  if you're bored  not here  here's one use for it. You can go with the  Sticks One  music. Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it  which is all about plumb. I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb  square and level. And they influenced that  and this next piece  which I'll do a little segment of.  Two Sticks   you can go with it. Thanks. Which is again exploring space  or the lines in space. Working with space and the lines in space in a different way. Oh  let's see here. So  I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball  now  what if you attach something to it  or change it. This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together. And then creating space and the rhythm of space  using the surface of the balls  the surface of the arms. Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing  which is    what have I got here  OK. All right. I'm actually leading up to something  the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it. This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape. Now  what I just did was I worked with the mathematics    the diameter and the circumference. Sometimes these pieces are mathematical  in that way that I look at a shape and say  what about if I use this and this and this. Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with. The next piece that I'm going to do    which is the cylinders piece  if you want to get that up    it has to do with cylinder seals from about       years ago  which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that. It's a combination of that  the beauty of that  the shape  and the stories that were involved in it  as well as the fact that they protected the contents. The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness. So  if you want to go with the music for cylinders. Talking about geometry and everything  if you take the circle and you split it in half    can you run  S Curve music   I'm going to do just a short version of it. Circles split in half and rotated  and mythology. Anyway  that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it  and I dance around a small stage so    two minutes  just to end  The latest piece that I'm working on    what I love is that I never know what I'm working on  why I'm working on it. They're not ideas  they're instincts. And the latest thing that I'm working on    is something really    I don't know what it is yet. And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible. Well  because then it tells me the truth  instead of me imposing the truth. And what it is  is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves. And what it involves  and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not  but I'll do a little bit of it. It initially started off with me stacking these things  bunches of them  and then playing with the sense of space  of filling in the space. And then it started changing  and become folding on themselves. And then changing levels. Because my attempt is to make visual instruments  not to just make    I'll try one other thing. For work in three dimensions  with your perceptions of space and time. Now  I don't know exactly where it's going  but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing. And it's going to change as I go through it. But I really like it  it feels right. This may not be the right shape  and    look at this shape  and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it  just to see  just to play  because I love all different kinds of things to play with. Let's see here. To work with the positive and negative in a different way. And to change  and to change. So  I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space. We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me. How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film  The Birds   Any of you get really freaked out by that  You might want to leave now. So  this is a vending machine for crows. And over the past few days  many of you have been asking me   How did you come to this  How did you get started doing this   And it started  as with many great ideas  or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway  at a cocktail party. About    years ago  I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine  and we're sitting there  and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess. And he was telling me that really  we ought to try and eradicate these things. We gotta kill them because they're making a mess. I said that was stupid  you know  maybe we should just train them to do something useful. And he said that was impossible. And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying    when someone tells you it's impossible. So  I spent the next    years reading about crows in my spare time. And after    years of this  my wife eventually said   Look  you know  you gotta do this thing you've been talking about  and build the vending machine.  So I did. But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion  and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living    that are surviving. And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species  which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies  species like rats and cockroaches and crows. And as I started looking at them  I was finding that they had hyper adapted. They'd become extremely adept at living with us. And in return  we just tried to kill them all the time. And in doing so  we were breeding them for parasitism. We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways. So  for example  rats are incredibly responsive breeders. And cockroaches  as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows  have become really immune to the poisons that we're using. So  I thought  let's build something that's mutually beneficial. Well  then let's build something that we can both benefit from  and find some way to make a new relationship with these species. And so I built the vending machine. But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows. It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings    they're actually really thriving. They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America. And in all that area  they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings. So we may not think about them  but they're always around. And not surprisingly  given the human population growth  more than half of the human population is living in cities now. And out of those  nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities. We're seeing a population boom with crows. So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers. So that's no great surprise. But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way. And I'll give you an example of that. So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow. And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood. Here  she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube. But the researchers had a problem. They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there. And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before. You see  it wasn't working very well. So she adapted. Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before. No one taught her to bend this into a hook  had shown her how it could happen. But she did it all on her own. So keep in mind that she's never seen this done. Right. Yeah. All right. That's the part where the researchers freak out. So  it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really  really intelligent. Their brains are proportionate  in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are. There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have. For example  in Sweden  crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. And when the fishermen move off  the crows fly down  reel up the lines  and eat the fish or the bait. It's pretty annoying for the fishermen. On an entirely different tack  at University of Washington  they  a few years ago  were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus. Some students went out and netted some crows  brought them in  and were    weighed them  and measured them and whatnot  and then let them back out again. And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week  these crows  whenever these particular students walked around campus  these crows would caw at them  and run around and make their life kind of miserable. They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week. And the next month. And after summer break. Until they finally graduated and left campus  and    glad to get away  I'm sure    came back sometime later  and found the crows still remembered them. So    the moral being  don't piss off crows. So now  students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask. It's fairly interesting. So we know that these crows are really smart  but the more I dug into this  the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation. Video  Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments. In this Japanese city  they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can't manage  drop it among the traffic. The problem now is collecting the bits  without getting run over. Wait for the light to stop the traffic. Then  collect your cracked nut in safety. Joshua Klein  Yeah  yeah. Pretty interesting. So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts. In fact  that's old hat for crows. This happened about    years ago in a place called Sendai City  at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo. And since that time  all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior. And now  every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk  waiting to collect its lunch. So  they're learning from each other. And research bears this out. Parents seem to be teaching their young. They've learned from their peers. They've learned from their enemies. If I have a little extra time  I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely. The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation. And as we heard yesterday  that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble  and we're starting to see it with them. They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment  which is really useful if you live in a city. So we know that there's lots of crows. We found out they're really smart  and we found out that they can teach each other. And when all this became clear to me  I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine. So that's what we did. This is a vending machine for crows. And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages. It's pretty simple. Basically  what happens is that we put this out in a field  or someplace where there's lots of crows  and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine. And crows eventually come by  and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there. And eventually  they eat up all the peanuts. And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray  and they hop up and help themselves. And then they leave  and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts  and life is really dandy  if you're a crow. Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut. So  when they get really used to that  we move on to the crows coming back. Now  they're used to the sound of the machine  and they keep coming back  and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there. And when they get really happy about this  we go ahead and stymie them. And we move to the third stage  where we only give them a coin. Now  like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing  this really pisses them off. So  they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something    they sweep things out of the way with their beak. And they do that here  and that knocks the coins down the slot  and when that happens  they get a peanut. And so this goes on for some time. The crows learn that all they have to do is show up  wait for the coin to come out  put the coin in the slot  and then they get their peanut. And when they're really good and comfortable with that  we move to the final stage  in which they show up and nothing happens. And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals. Squirrels  for example  would show up  look for the peanut  go away. Come back  look for the peanut  go away. They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored  and then they go off and play in traffic. Crows  on the other hand  show up  and they try and figure it out. They know that this machine's been messing with them  through three different stages of behavior. They figure it's gotta have more to it. So  they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot. And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that   Hey  there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage  lying around on the ground   hops down  picks it up  drops it in the slot. And then  we're off to the races. That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts  until his friends figure out how to do it  and then there we go. So  what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts. Mind you  there's     million dollars' worth of change lost every year  but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows. Instead  I think we should look a little bit larger. I think that crows can be trained to do other things. For example  why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events  Or find expensive components from discarded electronics  Or maybe do search and rescue  The main thing  the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species. We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them  but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance. Thanks very much. How does the news shape the way we see the world  Here's the world based on the way it looks    based on landmass. And here's how news shapes what Americans see. This map     Applause     this map shows the number of seconds that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories  by country  in February of         just one year ago. Now  this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities. There was massive flooding in Indonesia. And in Paris  the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming. The U.S. accounted for    percent of total news coverage. And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining    percent  we see a lot of Iraq    that's that big green thing there    and little else. The combined coverage of Russia  China and India  for example  reached just one percent. When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story  here's how the world looked. What was that story  The death of Anna Nicole Smith. This story eclipsed every country except Iraq  and received    times the coverage of the IPCC report. And the cycle continues  as we all know  Britney has loomed pretty large lately. So  why don't we hear more about the world  One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half. Aside from one person ABC mini bureaus in Nairobi  New Delhi and Mumbai  there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa  India or South America    places that are home to more than two billion people. The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper. And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing when we see where people go for news. Local TV news looms large  and unfortunately only dedicates    percent of its coverage to international news. And what about the web  The most popular news sites don't do much better. Last year  Pew and the Colombia J School analyzed the        stories that appeared on Google News' front page. And they  in fact  covered the same    news events. Similarly  a study in e content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters  and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it. So  if you put it all together  this could help explain why today's college graduates  as well as less educated Americans  know less about the world than their counterparts did    years ago. And if you think it's simply because we are not interested  you would be wrong. In recent years  Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time grew to over    percent. The real question  is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans in our increasingly interconnected world  I know we can do better. And can we afford not to  Thank you. I write about food. I write about cooking. I take it quite seriously  but I'm here to talk about something that's become very important to me in the last year or two. It is about food  but it's not about cooking  per se. I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow. I'm not a vegetarian    this is the old Nixon line  right  But I still think that this       may be this year's version of this. Now  that is only a little bit hyperbolic. And why do I say it  Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined. There was the bomb  and there's now. And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives  but whether  if we could see the Earth a century from now  we'd recognize it. It's a holocaust of a different kind  and hiding under our desks isn't going to help. Start with the notion that global warming is not only real  but dangerous. Since every scientist in the world now believes this  and even President Bush has seen the light  or pretends to  we can take this is a given. Then hear this  please. After energy production  livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases. Nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production    more than transportation. Now  you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts  but methane is    times more poisonous than CO   and it's not just methane. Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation  air and water pollution  water shortages and loss of biodiversity. There's more. Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people  but to animals. But lists like this become kind of numbing  so let me just say this  if you're a progressive  if you're driving a Prius  or you're shopping green  or you're looking for organic  you should probably be a semi vegetarian. Now  I'm no more anti cattle than I am anti atom  but it's all in the way we use these things. There's another piece of the puzzle  which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday  and one you already know. There's no question  none  that so called lifestyle diseases    diabetes  heart disease  stroke  some cancers    are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world. And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet. Our demand for meat  dairy and refined carbohydrates    the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day    our demand for these things  not our need  our want  drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us. And those calories are in foods that cause  not prevent  disease. Now global warming was unforeseen. We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility. Maybe a few lung diseases here and there  but  you know  that's not such a big deal. The current health crisis  however  is a little more the work of the evil empire. We were told  we were assured  that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate  the healthier we'd be. No. Overconsumption of animals  and of course  junk food  is the problem  along with our paltry consumption of plants. Now  there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here  but the evidence is that plants    and I want to make this clear    it's not the ingredients in plants  it's the plants. It's not the beta carotene  it's the carrot. The evidence is very clear that plants promote health. This evidence is overwhelming at this point. You eat more plants  you eat less other stuff  you live longer. Not bad. But back to animals and junk food. What do they have in common  One  we don't need either of them for health. We don't need animal products  and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke. Two  both have been marketed heavily  creating unnatural demand. We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles. Three  their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health  and Earth friendly diet. Now  let's imagine a parallel. Let's pretend that our government supported an oil based economy  while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy  knowing all the while that the result would be pollution  war and rising costs. Incredible  isn't it  Yet they do that. And they do this here. It's the same deal. The sad thing is  when it comes to diet  is that even when well intentioned Feds try to do right by us  they fail. Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness  or they are puppets of agribusiness. So  when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants  rather than animals  that made people healthy  they encouraged us  via their overly simplistic food pyramid  to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  along with more carbs. What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others  and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food. But industry lobbyists would never let that happen. And guess what  Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness. So  instead of substituting plants for animals  our swollen appetites simply became larger  and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged. So called low fat diets  so called low carb diets    these are not solutions. But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local  or whether we're being nice to animals  the most important issues just aren't being addressed. Now  don't get me wrong. I like animals  and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches. But there's no way to treat animals well  when you're killing    billion of them a year. That's our number.    billion. If you strung all of them    chickens  cows  pigs and lambs    to the moon  they'd go there and back five times  there and back. Now  my math's a little shaky  but this is pretty good  and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long  but you get the idea. That's just the United States. And with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease  kindness might just be a bit of a red herring. Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down  and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. Another red herring might be exemplified by the word  locavore   which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. Seriously. And locavore  for those of you who don't know  is someone who eats only locally grown food    which is fine if you live in California  but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke. Between the official story    the food pyramid    and the hip locavore vision  you have two versions of how to improve our eating. They both get it wrong  though. The first at least is populist  and the second is elitist. How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States. And I'm going to go through that  at least the last hundred years or so  very quickly right now. A hundred years ago  guess what  Everyone was a locavore  even New York had pig farms nearby  and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion. Every family had a cook  usually a mom. And those moms bought and prepared food. It was like your romantic vision of Europe. Margarine didn't exist. In fact  when margarine was invented  several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink  so we'd all know that it was a fake. There was no snack food  and until the '  s  until Clarence Birdseye came along  there was no frozen food. There were no restaurant chains. There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people  but none of them would think to open another one. Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic. And fancy food was entirely French. As an aside  those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the     s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide. Back in those days  before even Julia  back in those days  there was no philosophy of food. You just ate. You didn't claim to be anything. There was no marketing. There were no national brands. Vitamins had not been invented. There were no health claims  at least not federally sanctioned ones. Fats  carbs  proteins    they weren't bad or good  they were food. You ate food. Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient  because it was an ingredient. The cornflake hadn't been invented. The Pop Tart  the Pringle  Cheez Whiz  none of that stuff. Goldfish swam. It's hard to imagine. People grew food  and they ate food. And again  everyone ate local. In New York  an orange was a common Christmas present  because it came all the way from Florida. From the '  s on  road systems expanded  trucks took the place of railroads  fresh food began to travel more. Oranges became common in New York. The South and West became agricultural hubs  and in other parts of the country  suburbs took over farmland. The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere. And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle  as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato  even in summer. Eventually  California produced too much food to ship fresh  so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods. Thus arrived convenience. It was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework. Now  I know everybody over the age of  like       their mouths are watering at this point. If we had a slide of Salisbury steak  even more so  right  But this may have cut down on housework  but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well. Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad. I  for one    and I'm not kidding    didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was   . Who needed it though  Meat was everywhere. What could be easier  more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak  But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally. Rather than spending their lives eating grass  for which their stomachs were designed  they were forced to eat soy and corn. They have trouble digesting those grains  of course  but that wasn't a problem for producers. New drugs kept them healthy. Well  they kept them alive. Healthy was another story. Thanks to farm subsidies  the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress  soy  corn and cattle became king. And chicken soon joined them on the throne. It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began  the thing we're only realizing just now. Listen to this  between      and       the world's population doubled. Meat consumption increased five fold. Now  someone had to eat all that stuff  so we got fast food. And this took care of the situation resoundingly. Home cooking remained the norm  but its quality was down the tubes. There were fewer meals with home cooked breads  desserts and soups  because all of them could be bought at any store. Not that they were any good  but they were there. Most moms cooked like mine  a piece of broiled meat  a quickly made salad with bottled dressing  canned soup  canned fruit salad. Maybe baked or mashed potatoes  or perhaps the stupidest food ever  Minute Rice. For dessert  store bought ice cream or cookies. My mom is not here  so I can say this now. This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself. It wasn't all bad. By the '  s  forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients. We tended gardens  we became interested in organic food  we knew or we were vegetarians. We weren't all hippies  either. Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well. Meanwhile  food production had become industrial. Industrial. Perhaps because it was being produced rationally  as if it were plastic  food gained magical or poisonous powers  or both. Many people became fat phobic. Others worshiped broccoli  as if it were God like. But mostly they didn't eat broccoli. Instead they were sold on yogurt  yogurt being almost as good as broccoli. Except  in reality  the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream. Similarly  let's look at a granola bar. You think that that might be healthy food  but in fact  if you look at the ingredient list  it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal. Sadly  it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma  if not actually killed    the beginning of the heyday of value added food  which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it. Think of the frozen chicken nugget. The chicken is fed corn  and then its meat is ground up  and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder  and then it's fried in corn oil. All you do is nuke it. What could be better  And zapped horribly  pathetically. By the '  s  home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets    and we all have our favorites  actually    made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home. At the same time  masses of women were entering the workforce  and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden. So now  you've got your pizza nights  you've got your microwave nights  you've got your grazing nights  you've got your fend for yourself nights and so on. Leading the way    what's leading the way  Meat  junk food  cheese  the very stuff that will kill you. So  now we clamor for organic food. That's good. And as evidence that things can actually change  you can now find organic food in supermarkets  and even in fast food outlets. But organic food isn't the answer either  at least not the way it's currently defined. Let me pose you a question. Can farm raised salmon be organic  when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet  even if the feed itself is supposedly organic  and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens  swimming in their own filth  And if that salmon's from Chile  and it's killed down there and then flown       miles  whatever  dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere  I don't know. Packed in Styrofoam  of course  before landing somewhere in the United States  and then being trucked a few hundred more miles. This may be organic in letter  but it's surely not organic in spirit. Now here is where we all meet. The locavores  the organivores  the vegetarians  the vegans  the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food. Even though we've come to this from different points  we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food. We need to start acting. And this is not only an issue of social justice  as Ann Cooper said    and  of course  she's completely right    but it's also one of global survival. Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue  the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food. As I said     percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production. How much livestock do you need to produce this     percent of the agricultural land on Earth     percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we'll eat. And this amount is predicted to double in the next    years or so. And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now  it's not going to be    years. There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do. And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life. The most common argument is that we need nutrients    even though we eat  on average  twice as much protein as even the industry obsessed USDA recommends. But listen  experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. What do you think we eat per day  Half a pound. But don't we need meat to be big and strong  Isn't meat eating essential to health  Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless  sissy  liberals  Some of us might think that would be a good thing. But  no  even if we were all steroid filled football players  the answer is no. In fact  there's no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth  and many will make you much healthier than ours does. We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition  we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition  and it's killing us. To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat    percent less meat    it's not enough of a cut  but it's a start. It would seem absurd  but that's exactly what should happen  and what progressive people  forward thinking people should be doing and advocating  along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants. I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously    one might say indiscriminately    for about    years. During that time  I've eaten and recommended eating just about everything. I'll never stop eating animals  I'm sure  but I do think that for the benefit of everyone  the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly. Ann Cooper's right. The USDA is not our ally here. We have to take matters into our own hands  not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone    and that's the hard part    but by improving our own. And that happens to be quite easy. Less meat  less junk  more plants. It's a simple formula  eat food. Eat real food. We can continue to enjoy our food  and we continue to eat well  and we can eat even better. We can continue the search for the ingredients we love  and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals. We'll reduce not only calories  but our carbon footprint. We can make food more important  not less  and save ourselves by doing so. We have to choose that path. Thank you. The first question is this. Our country has two exploration programs. One is NASA  with a mission to explore the great beyond  to explore the heavens  which we all want to go to if we're lucky. And you can see we have Sputnik  and we have Saturn  and we have other manifestations of space exploration. Well  there's also another program  in another agency within our government  in ocean exploration. It's in NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And my question is this   why are we ignoring the oceans   Here's the reason  or not the reason  but here's why I ask that question. If you compare NASA's annual budget to explore the heavens  that one year budget would fund NOAA's budget to explore the oceans for       years. Why  Why are we looking up  Is it because it's heaven  And hell is down here  Is it a cultural issue  Why are people afraid of the ocean  Or do they just assume the ocean is just a dark  gloomy place that has nothing to offer  I'm going to take you on a    minute trip on    percent of the planet  so buckle up. OK. And what we're going to do is we're going to immerse ourselves in my world. And what I'm going to try    I hope I make the following points. I'm going to make it right now in case I forget. Everything I'm going to present to you was not in my textbooks when I went to school. And most of all  it was not even in my college textbooks. I'm a geophysicist  and all my Earth science books when I was a student    I had to give the wrong answer to get an A. We used to ridicule continental drift. It was something we laughed at. We learned of Marshall Kay's geosynclinal cycle  which is a bunch of crap. In today's context  it was a bunch of crap  but it was the law of geology  vertical tectonics. All the things we're going to walk through in our explorations and discoveries of the oceans were mostly discoveries made by accident. Mostly discoveries made by accident. We were looking for something and found something else. And everything we're going to talk about represents a one tenth of one percent glimpse  because that's all we've seen. I have a characterization. This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water. It gives you the false impression it's a map. It is not a map. In fact  I have another version at my office and I ask people   Why are there mountains here  on this area here  but there are none over here   And they go   Well  gee  I don't know   saying   Is it a fracture zone  Is it a hot spot   No  no  that's the only place a ship's been. Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored. We had more exploration ships down there during Captain Cook's time than now. It's amazing. All right. So we're going to immerse ourselves in the    percent of the planet because  you know  it's really naive to think that the Easter Bunny put all the resources on the continents. You know  it's just ludicrous. We are always  constantly playing the zero sum game. You know  we're going to do this  we're going to take it away from something else. I believe in just enriching the economy. And we're leaving so much on the table     percent of the planet. And as I will point out later in the presentation     percent of the United States of America lies beneath the sea.    percent of our country that we own  have all legal jurisdiction  have all rights to do whatever we want  lies beneath the sea and we have better maps of Mars than that    percent. Why  OK. Now  I began my explorations the hard way. Back then    actually my first expedition was when I was    years old. It was    years ago. Do the math  I'm   . And I went out to sea on a Scripps ship and we almost got sunk by a giant rogue wave  and I was too young to be    you know  I thought it was great  I was a body surfer and I thought   Wow  that was an incredible wave   And we almost sank the ship  but I became enraptured with mounting expeditions. And over the last    years  I've done about             I keep doing them    expeditions. But in the early days  the only way I could get to the bottom was to crawl into a submarine  a very small submarine  and go down to the bottom. I dove in a whole series of different deep diving submersibles. Alvin and Sea Cliff and Cyana  and all the major deep submersibles we have  which are about eight. In fact  on a good day  we might have four or five human beings at the average depth of the Earth    maybe four or five human beings out of whatever billions we've got going. And so it's very difficult to get there  if you do it physically. But I was enraptured  and in my graduate years was the dawn of plate tectonics. And we realized that the greatest mountain range on Earth lies beneath the sea. The mid ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball. This is on a Mercator projection. But if you were to put it on an equal area projection  you'd see that the mid ocean ridge covers    percent of the Earth's total surface area. Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon. So we went to the moon  played golf up there  before we went to the largest feature on our own planet. And our interest in this mountain range  as Earth scientists in those days  was not only because of its tremendous size  dominating the planet  but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin. Because it's along the axis of the mid ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating. And like a living organism  you tear it open  it bleeds its molten blood  rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere  hardens  forms new tissue and moves laterally. But no one had actually gone down into the actual site of the boundary of creation as we call it    into the Rift Valley    until a group of seven of us crawled in our little submarines in the summer of            and were the first human beings to enter the Great Rift Valley. We went down into the Rift Valley. This is all accurate except for one thing    it's pitch black. It's absolutely pitch black  because photons cannot reach the average depth of the ocean  which is        feet. In the Rift Valley  it's       feet. Most of our planet does not feel the warmth of the sun. Most of our planet is in eternal darkness. And for that reason  you do not have photosynthesis in the deep sea. And with the absence of photosynthesis you have no plant life  and as a result  you have very little animal life living in this underworld. Or so we thought. And so in our initial explorations  we were totally focused on exploring the boundary of creation  looking at the volcanic features running along that entire        miles. Running along this entire        miles are tens of thousands of active volcanoes. Tens of thousands of active volcanoes. There are more active volcanoes beneath the sea than on land by two orders of magnitude. So  it's a phenomenally active region  it's not just a dark  boring place. It's a very alive place. And it's then being ripped open. But we were dealing with a particular scientific issue back then. We couldn't understand why you had a mountain under tension. In plate tectonic theory  we knew that if you had plates collide  it made sense  they would crush into one another  you would thicken the crust  you'd uplift it. That's why you get  you know  you get seashells up on Mount Everest. It's not a flood  it was pushed up there. We understood mountains under compression  but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension. It should not be. Until one of my colleagues said   It looks to me like a thermal blister  and the mid ocean ridge must be a cooling curve.  We said   Let's go find out.  We punched a bunch of heat probes. Everything made sense  except  at the axis  there was missing heat. It was missing heat. It was hot. It wasn't hot enough. So  we came up with multiple hypotheses  there's little green people down there taking it  there's all sorts of things going on. But the only logical  explanation  was that there were hot springs. So  there must be underwater hot springs. We mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat. And so we went along this mountain range  in an area along Galapagos Rift  and did we find the missing heat. It was amazing. These giant chimneys  huge giant chimneys. We went up to them with our submersible. We wanted to get a temperature probe  we stuck it in there  looked at it    it pegged off scale. The pilot made this great observation   That's hot.  And then we realized our probe was made out of the same stuff    it could have melted. But it turns out the exiting temperature was     degrees F  hot enough to melt lead. This is what a real one looks like  on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. What you're looking at is an incredible pipe organ of chemicals coming out of the ocean. Everything you see in this picture is commercial grade  copper  lead  silver  zinc and gold. So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor  and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range. We're making huge discoveries of large commercial grade ore along this mountain range  but it was dwarfed by what we discovered. We discovered a profusion of life  in a world that it should not exist  in . Giant tube worms     feet tall. I remember having to use vodka    my own vodka    to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde. We went and found these incredible clam beds sitting on the barren rock. Large clams  and when we opened them  they didn't look like a clam. And when we cut them open  they didn't have the anatomy of a clam. No mouth  no gut  no digestive system. Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism  a bacterium  that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark  through a process we now call chemosynthesis. None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks. We did not know about this life system. We were not predicting it. We stumbled on it  looking for some missing heat. So  we wanted to accelerate this process. We wanted to get away from this silly trip  up and down on a submarine  average depth of the ocean         feet  two and half hours to get to work in the morning  two and half hours to get to home. Five hour commute to work. Three hours of bottom time  average distance traveled    one mile. On a        mile mountain range. Great job security  but not the way to go. So  I began designing a new technology of telepresence  using robotic systems to replicate myself  so I wouldn't have to cycle my vehicle system. We began to introduce that in our explorations  and we continued to make phenomenal discoveries with our new robotic technologies. Again  looking for something else  moving from one part of the mid ocean ridge to another. The scientists were off watch and they came across incredible life forms. They came across new creatures they had not seen before. But more importantly  they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand. That did not make sense. They were not above a magma chamber. They shouldn't be there. And we called it Lost City. And Lost City was characterized by these incredible limestone formations and upside down pools. Look at that. How do you do that  That's water upside down. We went in underneath and tapped it  and we found that it had the pH of Drano. The pH of     and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment. And the hydrothermal vents were in an acidic environment. All the way at the other end  in an alkaline environment  at a pH of     life existed. So life was much more creative than we had ever thought. Again  discovered by accident. Just two years ago working off Santorini  where people are sunning themselves on the beach  unbeknownst to them in the caldera nearby  we found phenomenal hydrothermal vent systems and more life systems. This was two miles from where people go to sunbathe  and they were oblivious to the existence of this system. Again  you know  we stop at the water's edge. Recently  diving off    in the Gulf of Mexico  finding pools of water  this time not upside down  right side up. Bingo. You'd think you're in air  until a fish swims by. You're looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs. Near that was methane. I've never seen volcanoes of methane. Instead of belching out lava  they were belching out big  big bubbles of methane. And they were creating these volcanoes  and there were flows  not of lava  but of the mud coming out of the Earth but driven by    I've never seen this before. Moving on  there's more than just natural history beneath the sea    human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic. The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth. It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined. And yet we're only now penetrating it. Finding the state of preservation. We found the Bismarck in        feet. We then found the Yorktown. People always ask   Did you find the right ship   It said Yorktown on the stern. More recently  finding ancient history. How many ancient mariners have had a bad day  The number's a million. We've been discovering these along ancient trade routes  where they're not supposed to be. This shipwreck sank     years before the birth of Christ. This one sank carrying a prefabricated  Home Depot Roman temple. And then here's one that sank at the time of Homer  at     B.C. More recently  into the Black Sea  where we're exploring. Because there's no oxygen there  it's the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on Earth. Shipwrecks are perfectly preserved. All their organics are perfectly preserved. We begin to excavate them. We expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their DNA. Look at the state of preservation    still the ad mark of a carpenter. Look at the state of those artifacts. You still see the beeswax dripping. When they dropped  they sealed it. This ship sank       years ago. Fortunately  we've been able to convince Congress. We begin to go on the Hill and lobby. And we stole recently a ship from the United States Navy. The Okeanos Explorer on its mission. Its mission is as good as you could get. Its mission is to go where no one has gone before on planet Earth. And I was looking at it yesterday  it's up in Seattle. OK. It comes online this summer  and it begins its journey of exploration. But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology. But certainly  it's going to be going to the unknown America. This is that part of the United States that lies beneath the sea. We own all of that blue and yet  like I say  particularly the western territorial trust  we don't have maps of them. We don't have maps of them. We have maps of Venus  but not of the western territorial trust. The way we're going to run this    we have no idea what we're going to discover. We have no idea what we're going to discover. We're going to discover an ancient shipwreck  a Phoenician off Brazil  or a new rock formation  a new life. So  we're going to run it like an emergency hospital. We're going to connect our command center  via a high bandwidth satellite link to a building we're building at the University of Rhode Island  called the Interspace Center. And within that  we're going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine  blue gold team  switching them off and on  running    hours a day. A discovery is made  that discovery is instantly seen in the command center a second later. But then it's connected through Internet too    the new Internet highway that makes Internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway    with    gigabits of bandwidth. We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of. It's a big blank sheet on our planet. We'll map it within hours  have the maps disseminated out to the major universities. It turns out that    percent of all the oceanographic intellect in this country are at    universities. They're all on I  . We can then build a command center. This is a remote center at the University of Washington. She's talking to the pilot. She's       miles away  but she's assumed command. But the beauty of this  too  is we can then disseminate it to children. We can disseminate. They can follow this expedition. I've started a program    where are you Jim  Jim Young who helped me start a program called the Jason Project. More recently  we've started a program with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  so that we can use exploration  and the excitement of live exploration  to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they're already ready for. I would not let an adult drive my robot. You don't have enough gaming experience. But I will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system. Because we want to create    we want to create the classroom of tomorrow. We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done. You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade. The game is not over    it's over by the eighth grade  it's not beginning. We need to be not only proud of our universities. We need to be proud of our middle schools. And when we have the best middle schools in the world  we'll have the best kids pumped out of that system  let me tell you. Because this is what we want. This is what we want. This is a young lady  not watching a football game  not watching a basketball game. Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away  and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing. And when you get a jaw drop  you can inform. You can put so much information into that mind  it's in full  receiving  mode. This  I hope  will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth. And my final question  my final question    why are we not looking at moving out onto the sea  Why do we have programs to build habitation on Mars  and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon  but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet  And the technology is at hand. Thank you very much. Being a child  and sort of crawling around the house  I remember these Turkish carpets  and there were these scenes  these battle scenes  these love scenes. I mean  look  this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier. And my mom took these pictures actually  last week  of our carpets  and I remember this to this day. There was another object  this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity    pretty scary stuff  when you're a little kid. What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories  so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work. And then there was another influence. I was a teenager  and at    or     I guess like all teenagers  we want to just do what we love and what we believe in. And so  I fused together the two things I loved the most  which was skiing and windsurfing. Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland. So  I created this compilation of the two  I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there  and some foot straps  and some metal fins  and here I was  going really fast on frozen lakes. It was really a death trap. I mean  it was incredible  it worked incredibly well  but it was really dangerous. And I realized then I had to go to design school. I mean  look at those graphics there. So  I went to design school  and it was the early '  s when I finished. And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley  so I wanted to be there  and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes  that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes. And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy  and we would get in to these meetings  and these managers would come in  and they would say   Well  what we're going to do here is really important  you know.  And they would give the projects code names  you know  mostly from  Star Wars   actually  things like C PO  Yoda  Luke. So  in anticipation  I would be this young designer in the back of the room  and I would raise my hand  and I would ask questions. I mean  in retrospect  probably stupid questions  but things like   What's this Caps Lock key for   or  What's this Num Lock key for   You know  that thing   You know  do people really use it  Do they need it  Do they want it in their homes   What I realized then is  they didn't really want to change the legacy stuff  they didn't want to change the insides. They were really looking for us  the designers  to create the skins  to put some pretty stuff outside of the box. And I didn't want to be a colorist. It wasn't what I wanted to do. I didn't want to be a stylist in this way. And then I saw this quote   advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal.  So  I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco  and I started a little company  fuseproject. And what I wanted to work on is important stuff. And I wanted to really not just work on the skins  but I wanted to work on the entire human experience. And so the first projects were sort of humble  but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way  and maybe finding some new functionality. This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper  the car company  right when it launched  and it's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical. And that allows me to check my timer discretely  here  without bending my elbow. And other projects  which were really about transformation  about matching the human need. This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer  and it ships completely flat  and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot. And something a little bit more experimental  this is a light fixture for Swarovski  and what it does is  it changes shape. So  it goes from a circle  to a round  to a square  to a figure eight. And just by drawing on a little computer tablet  the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want. And then finally  the leaf lamp for Herman Miller. This is a pretty involved process  it took us about four and a half years. But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light  a new experience of light. So  we had to design both the light and the light bulb. And that's a unique opportunity  I would say  in design. And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm  sort of glowing kind of mood light  all the way to a bright work light. So  the light bulb actually does that. It allows the person to switch  and to mix these two colorations. And it's done in a very simple way  one just touches the base of the light  and on one side  you can mix the brightness  and on the other  the coloration of the light. So  all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them  and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world  whether it's for business  or  as I'm going to show  on some civic type projects. Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business  value to the users also  but I think it's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value. And the values we bring can be about environmental issues  about sustainability  about lower power consumption. You know  they can be about function and beauty  they can be about business strategy. But designers are really the glue that brings these things together. So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with  and it has a humanistic technology. It feels your skin. It rests on your skin  and it knows when it is you're talking. And by knowing when it is you're talking  it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about  which is the environmental noises. But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff  and all the nerdy stuff out of it  and try to make it as beautiful as we can. I mean  think about it  the care we take in selecting sunglasses  or jewelry  or accessories is really important  so if it isn't beautiful  it really doesn't belong on your face. And this is what we're pursuing here. But how we work on Jawbone is really unique. I want to point at something here  on the left. This is the board  this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work. But this is the design process  there's somebody changing the board  putting tracers on the board  changing the location of the ICs  as the designers on the other side are doing the work. So  it's not about slapping skins  anymore  on a technology. It's really about designing from the inside out. And then  on the other side of the room  the designers are making small adjustments  sketching  drawing by hand  putting it in the computer. And it's what I call being design driven. You know  there is some push and pull  but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out. And then  of course  design is never done. And this is    the other new way that is unique in how we work is  because it's never done  you have to do all this other stuff. The packaging  and the website  and you need to continue to really touch the user  in many ways. But how do you retain somebody  when it's never done  And Hosain Rahman  the CEO of Aliph Jawbone  you know  really understands that you need a different structure. So  in a way  the different structure is that we're partners  it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project  and then we also share in the rewards. And here's another project  another partnership type approach. This is called Y Water  and it's this guy from Los Angeles  Thomas Arndt  Austrian originally  who came to us  and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink  or an organic drink for his kids  to replace the high sugar content sodas that he's trying to get them away from. So  we worked on this bottle  and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension. And this allows the bottle to turn into a game. The bottles connect together  and you can create different shapes  different forms. Thank you. And then while we were doing this  the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y  and then we thought  well these words   why  and  why not   are probably the most important words that kids ask. So we called it Y Water. And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room  the three dimensional design  the ideas  the branding  it all becomes deeply connected. And then the other thing about this project is  we bring intellectual property  we bring a marketing approach  we bring all this stuff  but I think  at the end of the day  what we bring is these values  and these values create a soul for the companies we work with. And it's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor  when others can be creative and do more with it. Here's another project  which I think really emulates that. This is the One Laptop per Child  the      laptop. This picture is incredible. In Nigeria  people carry their most precious belongings on their heads. This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head. I mean  to me  it just means so much. But when Nicholas Negroponte    and he has spoken about this project a lot  he's the founder of OLPC    came to us about two and a half years ago  there were some clear ideas. He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology  and those are pillars of his life  but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child. But the third pillar that he talked about was design. And at the time  I wasn't really working on computers. I didn't really want to  from the previous adventure. But what he said was really significant  is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product  how we were going to make it low cost  robust. And plus  he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key    and the Num Lock key  too. So  I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic  to look different. To look like it's for a kid  but not like a toy. And then the integration of all these great technologies  which you've heard about  the Wi Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect  the screen  which you can read in sunlight  the keyboard  which is made out of rubber  and it's protected from the environment. You know  all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers. They fought the suppliers  they fought the manufacturers. I mean  they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is. And in a way  it is that will that makes projects like this one    allows the process from not destroying the original idea. And I think this is something really important. So  now you get these pictures    you get up in the morning  and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers  and in Mongolia. And we went away from obviously the beige. I mean it's colorful  it's fun. In fact  you can see each logo is a little bit different. It's because we were able to run  during the manufacturing process     colors for the X and the O  which is the name of the computer  and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor  you get    times     you get     different options there. So  the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible. But this is my nephew  Anthony  in Switzerland  and he had the laptop for an afternoon  and I had to take it back. It was hard. And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later  I come back to Switzerland  and there he is playing with his own version. Like paper  paper and cardboard. So  I'm going to finish with one last project  and this is a little bit more of adult play. Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom. It's actually just launched  actually launched on Valentine's Day  February     about    days ago. So  the Department of Health in New York came to us  and they needed a way to distribute    million condoms for free to the citizens of New York. So a pretty big endeavor  and we worked on the dispensers. These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape. It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant  and it has to be easily serviceable  you have to know where it is and what it does. And we also designed the condoms themselves. And I was just in New York at the launch  and I went to see all these places where they're installed  this is at a Puerto Rican little mom and pop store  at a bar in Christopher Street  at a pool hall. I mean  they're being installed in homeless clinics    everywhere. Of course  clubs and discos  too. And here's the public service announcement for this project. Get some. So  this is really where design is able to create a conversation. I was in these venues  and people were  you know  really into getting them. They were excited. It was breaking the ice  it was getting over a stigma  and I think that's also what design can do. So  I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot  but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here. Yeah  All right  all right. I have only a few. So  I have more  you can always ask me for some more later. And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom  you can just say you like the design. So  I'll finish with just one thought  if we all work together on creating value  but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do  I think we can change the work that we do. We can change these values  can change the companies we work with  and eventually  together  maybe we can change the world. So  thank you. A few words about how I got started  and it has a lot to do with happiness  actually. When I was a very young child  I was extremely introverted and very much to myself. And  kind of as a way of surviving  I would go into my own very personal space  and I would make things. I would make things for people as a way of  you know  giving  showing them my love. I would go into these private places  and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects    and sort of learning how to speak with my hands. So  the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm  but also with very much the feeling realm. And the ideas are very disparate. I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces  and there's no real connection between one or the other  except that they sort of come out of my brain  and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life  and seeing nature and seeing objects  and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things. When I was a child  I started to explore motion. I fell in love with the way things moved  so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks. And this is one that I did  probably like when I was around seventh grade  and I remember when I was doing this  I was thinking about that little rock there  and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air  and how the characters    would come shooting out of the car  so  on my mind  I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles. And of course  when you're a little kid  there's always destruction. So  it has to end with this    gratuitous violence. So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved  and expressed it. Now  when I went to college  I found myself making fairly complicated  fragile machines. And this really came about from having many different kinds of interests. When I was in high school  I loved to program computers  so I sort of liked the logical flow of events. I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon  because it meant working with my hands in a very focused  intense way. So  I started taking art courses  and I found a way to make sculpture that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands  with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system. And also  working with wire    everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time. So  I was able to sort of exercise all of that. Now  this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting. And it's full of many little trivial end points  like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything. It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality. The connection I have with engineering is the same as any other engineer  in that I love to solve problems. I love to figure things out  but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous. That's pretty ambiguous. The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex. I gave myself the problem. Since I'm always liking to solve problems  I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction  and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth. So  when I started this  I didn't have an overall plan for the machine  but I did have a sense of the gesture  and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space. And then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point. That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction. And that's a little found object. So a lot of the pieces that I've made  they involve found objects. And it really    it's almost like doing visual puns all the time. When I see objects  I imagine them in motion. I imagine what can be said with them. This next one here   Machine with Wishbone   it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner. You know  they say  never play with your food    but I always play with things. So  I had this wishbone  and I thought  it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long. And I started to make him walk across the table  and I thought   Oh  I can make a little machine that will do that.  So  I made this device  linked it up  and the wishbone walks. And because the wishbone is bone    it's animal    it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it. And that's the whole piece. That's about that big. This kind of work is also very much like puppetry  where the found object is  in a sense  the puppet  and I'm the puppeteer at first  because I'm playing with an object. But then I make the machine  which is sort of the stand in for me  and it is able to achieve the action that I want. The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought  and it's a little piece called  Cory's Yellow Chair.  I had this image in my mind  when I saw my son's little chair  and I saw it explode up and out. And    so the way I saw this in my mind at first  was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed  and the pieces would move far out  and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel  to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center. And they would coalesce for just a moment  so you could perceive that there was a chair there. For me  it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment  and I wanted to express that. Now  the machine is    in this case  it's a real approximation of that  because obviously you can't move physical matter infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously. This whole thing is about four feet wide  and the chair itself is only about a few inches. Now  this is a funny sort of conceptual thing  and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis'         Year Clock.  So  we have a motor here on the left  and it goes through a gear train. There are    pairs of      reductions  so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once. So I've invented it in concrete  because it doesn't really matter. Because it could run all the time. Now  a completely different thought. I'm always imagining myself in different situations. I'm imagining myself as a machine. What would I love  I would love to be bathed in oil. So  this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil. And it's really  just sort of    for me  it was just really about the lusciousness of oil. And then  I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art  and I didn't have any pieces. But when she suggested to be in the show  this piece came to mind. So  it's sort of related  but you can see it's much more overtly erotic. And this one I call  Machine with Grease.  It's just continually ejaculating  and it's    this is a happy machine  I'll tell you. It's definitely happy. From an engineering point of view  this is just a little four bar linkage. And then again  this is a found object  a little fan that I found. And I thought  what about the gesture of opening the fan  and how simply could I state something. And  in a case like this  I'm trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant. For me  the process is very important  because I'm inventing machines  but I'm also inventing tools to make machines  and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning. So this is a little wire bending tool. After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers  I made that tool  and then I made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly    sort of developing my own little world of technology. My life completely changed when I found a spot welder. And that was that tool. It completely changed what I could do. Now here  I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering. This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school. I just like  throw it in. I mean  real jewelers put little bits of solder in. So  that's a finished gear. When I moved to Boston  I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society. And the idea  their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street  and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best. It would be    whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner. So I made    this is my first racing sculpture  and I thought   Oh  I'm going to make a cart  and I'm going to have it    I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster ' so as I run down the street  the cart's going to talk to me and it's going to go  'Faster  faster '   So  that's what it does. But then in the end  what I decided was every time you finish writing the word  I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road. So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping. But I had a lot of fun. Now  I only have two and a half minutes    I'm going to play this. This is a piece that  for me  is in some ways the most complete kind of piece. Because when I was a kid  I also played a lot of guitar. And when I had this thought  I was imagining that I would make    I would have a whole machine theater evening  where I would    you would have an audience  the curtain would open  and you'd be entertained by machines on stage. So  I imagined a very simple gestural dance that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair  and ... When I'm making these pieces  I'm always trying to find a point where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple  but also at the same time it's very ambiguous. And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it. And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces start off in my own mind  in my heart  and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials  and it always feels really crude. It's always a struggle  but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object  and then it's there  OK. It means nothing at all. The object itself just means nothing. Once it's perceived  and someone brings it into their own mind  then there's a cycle that has been completed. And to me  that's the most important thing because  ever since being a kid  I've wanted to communicate my passion and love. And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside  out to the physical  to someone perceiving it. So I'll just let this chair come down. Thank you. Just to put everything in context  and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from  so that a lot of the things I'm going to say  and the things I'm going to do    or things I'm going to tell you I've done    you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am. I graduated high school in Cleveland  Ohio      . And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad  we went back home. Finished university education  got a medical degree      . And by the time I was an intern house officer  I could barely afford to maintain my mother's    year old car    and I was a paid doctor. This brings us to why a lot of us  who are professionals  are now  as they say  in diaspora. Now  are we going to make that a permanent thing  where we all get trained  and we leave  and we don't go back  Perhaps not  I should certainly hope not    because that is not my vision. All right  for good measure  that's where Nigeria is on the African map  and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of. People getting kidnapped  where the oil comes from  the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria. But  critical poverty  this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care. Very interesting. How many people do you think are on that taxi  And believe it or not  that is a taxi in Nigeria. And the capital    well  what used to be the capital of Nigeria    Lagos  that's a taxi  and you have police on them. So  tell me  how many policemen do you think are on this taxi  And now  Three. So  when these kind of people    and  believe me  it's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these  and I didn't have a helmet  either. And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off  has an accident and needs a hospital. Believe it or not  some of us do survive. Some of us do survive malaria  we do survive AIDS. And like I tell my family  and my wife reminds me every time   You're risking your life  you know  every time you go to that country.  And she's right. Every time you go there  you know that if you actually need critical care    critical care of any sort    if you have an accident    of which there are many  there are accidents everywhere    where do they go  Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff  I'm not saying instead of  I'm saying as well as  AIDS  TB  malaria  typhoid    the list goes on. I'm saying  where do they go when they're like me  When I go back home    and I do all kinds of things  I teach  I train    but I catch one of these things  or I'm chronically ill with one of those  where do they go  What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled  I think it's quite significant. This is where they go. These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden    this is a major hospital. In fact  it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria. Now that is less than a year old  in an operating room. That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria. You remember all that oil  Yes  I'm sorry if it upsets some of you  but I think you need to see this. That's the floor  OK  You can say some of this is education. You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty. I'm saying we need more than just  you know  vaccination  malaria  AIDS  because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there. In fact  when I start running around saying   Hey  boys and girls  you're cardiologists in the U.S.  can you come home with me and do a mission   I want them to think   Well there's some hope.  Now  have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine. And that's my specialty  right  Anesthesiology and critical care    look at that bag. It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. And believe me  these are current pictures. Now  if something like this  which has happened in the U.K.  that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work. All right  this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria  and jokingly we refer to it as  Expensive Scare.  Because it's scary and it's expensive  but we need to have it  OK  So  these are the problems. There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are  are there  I think we all know. And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems. These are a few of them. So  what did I do  There we go    we're going on a mission. We're going to do some open heart surgery. I was the only Brit  on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons  cardiac nurse  intensive care nurse. We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far. Just so you know  I do believe in missions  I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity. They have their place  but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier  Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission. Health is wealth  in the words of Hans Rosling. You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first. So  here we are  mission. Big trouble. Open heart surgery in Nigeria    big trouble. That's Mike  Mike comes out from Mississippi. Does he look like he's happy  It took us two days just to organize the place  but hey  you know  we worked on it. Does he look happy  Yes  that's the medical advice the committee chairman says   Yes  I told you  you weren't going to be able to  you can't do this  I just know it.  Look  that's the technician we had. So yes  you go on  all right  I got him to come with me    anesthesia tech    come with me from the U.K. Yes  let's just go work this thing out. See  that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally. We get a lot of donated equipment. Equipment that's obsolete  equipment that doesn't quite work  or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that  so long as we use it and we move on. But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there. He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone. So what we going to do now  It looks like all these Americans are here and yes  one Brit  and he's not going to do anything    he thinks he's British actually  and he's actually Nigerian  I just thought about that. We eventually got it working  is the truth  but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw. The reason I have this picture here  this X ray  it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X rays. Do you figure where that is  It was on a window. I mean  what's an X ray viewing box  Please. Well  nowadays everything's on PAX anyway. You look at your X rays on a screen and you do stuff with them  you email them. But we were still using X rays  but we didn't even have a viewing box  And we were doing open heart surgery. OK  I know it's not AIDS  I know it's not malaria  but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah  echo    this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready. People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease  VSD  hole in the heart  tetralogies. You still get people who believe in it and they came. At    percent oxygen saturation  the normal is about   . Her condition  open heart surgery that as she required  would have been treated when she was a child. We had to do these for adults. So  we did succeed and we still do. We've done three. We're planning another one in July in the north of the country. So  we certainly still do open heart  but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in    we ship everything  instruments. We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it. The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. But how many did we do the first one    . We did    open heart surgical patients successfully. Here is our very first patient  out of intensive care  and just watch that chair  all right  This is what I mean about appropriate technology. That's what he was doing  propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work. Have you seen one of those before  No  Yes  Doesn't matter  it worked. I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before   We  the willing  have been doing so much with so little for so long       we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.  Thank you. Sustainable Solutions    this was my first company. This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing. So  we put my hand in my pocket and say   Guys  let's just buy stuff. Let's go set up a company that teaches people  educates them  gives them the tools they need to keep going.  And that's a perfect example of one. Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital  you buy a different one for children  you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything  and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air. If you're in America and you don't know about this one  we do  because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for Africa    what's appropriately priced  does the job  and we move on. Anesthesia machine  multi parameter monitor  operating lights  suction. This little unit here    remember your little    volt plug in the car  that charges your  whatever  Game Boy  telephone  That's exactly how the outlets are designed. Yes  it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it. But if you've got mains as well  it will charge the batteries in there. And guess what  We have a little pedal charger too  just in case. And guess what  if it all fails  if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in  it will still work. Then you can customize it. Is it dental surgery you want  General surgery you want  Decide which instruments  stock it up with consumables. And currently we're working on oxygen    oxygen delivery on site. The technology for oxygen delivery is not new. Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new  and what we will have in a few months  I hope  is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite    it's not new    zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is    percent of air. If you take nitrogen out  what's left  Oxygen  pretty much. So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it. These are the basic features of my device  or our device. This is what makes it so special. Apart from the awards it's won  it's portable and it's certified. It's registered  the MHRA    and the CE mark  for those who don't know  for Europe  is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. If you compare it with what's on the market  price wise  size wise  ease of use  complexity ... This picture was taken last year. These are members of my graduating class      . It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac  for those of you who are familiar with Maryland. There are too many of us outside and everybody  just to borrow a bit from Hans    Hans Rosling  he's my guy    if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention  it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa    looking at the culture  looking at the people  looking at how much money they've got. African people  because they will do it with a passion  I hope. And lots and lots of that little bit down there  sacrifice. You have to do it. Africans have to do it  in conjunction with everyone else. Thank you. So  can we dare to be optimistic  Well  the thesis of  The Bottom Billion  is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for    years  and hence diverging from the rest of mankind. And so  the real question to pose is not   Can we be optimistic   It's   How can we give credible hope to that billion people   That  to my mind  is the fundamental challenge now of development. What I'm going to offer you is a recipe  a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good  which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest. Compassion  because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope. That is a human tragedy. Enlightened self interest  because if that economic divergence continues for another    years  combined with social integration globally  it will build a nightmare for our children. We need compassion to get ourselves started  and enlightened self interest to get ourselves serious. That's the alliance that changes the world. So  what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion  What can we actually do  Well  a good guide is to think   What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world   That gives us  it turns out  quite a good clue  except you have to go back quite a long time. The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late     s. The rich world was you  America  and the region that needed to be developed was my world  Europe. That was post War Europe. Why did America get serious  It wasn't just compassion for Europe  though there was that. It was that you knew you had to  because  in the late     s  country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc  and so you knew you'd no choice. Europe had to be dragged into economic development. So  what did you do  last time you got serious  Well  yes  you had a big aid program. Thank you very much. That was Marshall aid  we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution. But what else did you do  Well  you tore up your trade policy  and totally reversed it. Before the war  America had been highly protectionist. After the war  you opened your markets to Europe  you dragged Europe into the then global economy  which was your economy  and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So  total reversal of trade policy. Did you do anything else  Yes  you totally reversed your security policy. Before the war  your security policy had been isolationist. After the war  you tear that up  you put         troops in Europe for over    years. So  total reversal of security policy. Anything else  Yes  you tear up the  Eleventh Commandment     national sovereignty. Before the war  you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations. After the war  you found the United Nations  you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  you found the IMF  you encouraged Europe to create the European Community    all systems for mutual government support. That is still the waterfront of effective policies  aid  trade  security  governments. Of course  the details of policy are going to be different  because the challenge is different. It's not rebuilding Europe  it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion  so that they actually catch up. Is that easier or harder  We need to be at least as serious as we were then. Now  today I'm going to take just one of those four. I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest  the one that's just motherhood and apple pie    governments  mutual systems of support for governments    and I'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance  and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now. The opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion  and that is the commodity booms. The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many  though not all  of the countries of the bottom billion. Partly  they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high  but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries. Uganda has just discovered oil  in about the most disastrous location on Earth  Ghana has discovered oil  Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground. So  a mass of new discoveries. Between them  these new revenue flows dwarf aid. Just to give you one example  Angola alone is getting    billion dollars a year in oil revenue. The entire aid flows to the    countries of the bottom billion last year were    billion. So  the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent. So there's the optimism. The question is  how is it going to help their development  It's a huge opportunity for transformational development. Will it be taken  So  here comes a bit of science  and this is a bit of science I've done since  The Bottom Billion   so it's new. I've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports  and the growth of commodity exporting countries. And I've looked globally  I've taken all the countries in the world for the last    years  and looked to see what the relationship is. And the short run    say  the first five to seven years    is just great. In fact  it's hunky dory  everything goes up. You get more money because your terms of trade have improved  but also that drives up output across the board. So GDP goes up a lot    fantastic  That's the short run. And how about the long run  Come back    years later. Well  the short run  it's hunky dory  but the long run  it's humpty dumpty. You go up in the short run  but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all. That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go  it's a forecast of the consequences  the long term consequences  for growth of an increase in prices. So  what goes wrong  Why is there this  resource curse   as it's called  And again  I've looked at that  and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance  the initial level of economic governance  when the resource booms accrue. In fact  if you've got good enough governance  there is no resource boom. You go up in the short term  and then you go up even more in the long term. That's Norway  the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada. The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance. They still go up in the short run. That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment. The best growth rates they've had    ever. And the question is whether the short run will persist. And with bad governance historically  over the last    years  it hasn't. It's countries like Nigeria  which are worse off than if they'd never had oil. So  there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term  and below which you go down. Just to benchmark that threshold  it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid     s. So  the question is  are the bottom billion above or below that threshold  Now  there's one big change since the commodity booms of the     s  and that is the spread of democracy. So I thought  well  maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion. Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy. So  I looked. Democracy does have significant effects    and unfortunately  they're adverse. Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies. At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research  but       it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that. Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy  there's electoral competition  which determines how you acquire power  and there are checks and balances  which determine how you use power. It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy  whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good. And so  what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances. They haven't got them. They got instant democracy in the     s  elections without checks and balances. How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances  In all the societies of the bottom billion  there are intense struggles to do just that. The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards  which will be voluntary  but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues. We know these international standards work because we've already got one. It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have. No sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it  pushed it and published the revenues in the paper. Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked. People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue. So  we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards  I can't go through all of them  but I'll give you an example. The first is how to take the resources out of the ground    the economic processes  taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground. And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction. You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment  how they've been sold over the last    years  A company flies in  does a deal with a minister. And that's great for the company  and it's quite often great for the minister       and it's not great for their country. There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that  and it's called verified auctions. The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury    that is  the British Treasury. And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth. They worked out they were worth two billion pounds. Just in time  a set of economists got there and said   Why not try an auction  It'll reveal the value.  It went for    billion pounds through auction. If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of     think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like. When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone  the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions. There are five such decision points  each one needs an international standard. If we could do it  we would change the world. We would be helping the reformers in these societies  who are struggling for change. That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies  but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing  because the odds are so stacked against them. And yet  we've not got these rules. If you think about it  the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch    nothing. Why on Earth are they not there  I realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies  politicians will get away with gestures. That unless we have an informed society  what politicians do  especially in relation to Africa  is gestures  things that look good  but don't work. And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry. That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist  and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach. However  I have to say  the process of communication does not come naturally to me. This is why I'm on this stage  but it's alarming. I grew up in a culture of self effacement. My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks  and the blog comment said   Collier is not charismatic       but his arguments are compelling.  If you agree with that sentiment  and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry  you will realize that I need you. Please  become ambassadors. Thank you. Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet. By the time you realize what's happening  the child is a toddler  up and causing havoc  and it's too late to put it back. We humans are Earth's Pandoran species. We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box  and we can't push it back in. We're seeing the consequences all around us. Now that  I suggest  is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously. And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet  but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos. So first of all  I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes  and secondly  how this might answer questions about who's out there  if indeed anyone is. So  memetics  memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism. Darwin had this amazing idea. Indeed  some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had. Isn't that a wonderful thought  that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had  Do you think there could  Audience  No. Susan Blackmore  Someone says no  very loudly  from over there. Well  I say yes  and if there is  I give the prize to Darwin. Why  Because the idea was so simple  and yet it explains all design in the universe. I would say not just biological design  but all of the design that we think of as human design. It's all just the same thing happening. What did Darwin say  I know you know the idea  natural selection  but let me just paraphrase  The Origin of Species         in a few sentences. What Darwin said was something like this  if you have creatures that vary  and that can't be doubted    I've been to the Galapagos  and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on  and so on. And     pages later. And if there is a struggle for life  such that nearly all of these creatures die    and this can't be doubted  I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted  and so on and so on. And another     pages later. And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive  then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were. You see the idea  If  if  if  then. He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm  but that's what he described in that book  and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm. The principle is you just need those three things    variation  selection and heredity. And as Dan Dennett puts it  if you have those  then you must get evolution. Or design out of chaos  without the aid of mind. There's one word I love on that slide. What do you think my favorite word is  Audience  Chaos. SB  Chaos  No. What  Mind  No. Audience  Without. SB  No  not without. You try them all in order  Mmm...  Audience  Must. SB  Must  at must. Must  must. This is what makes it so amazing. You don't need a designer  or a plan  or foresight  or anything else. If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected  then you must get design appearing out of nowhere. You can't stop it. Must is my favorite word there. Now  what's this to do with memes  Well  the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection. We're so used to thinking in terms of biology  we think about genes this way. Darwin didn't  of course  he didn't know about genes. He talked mostly about animals and plants  but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct. But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design. And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his      bestseller   The Selfish Gene.  The information that is copied  he called the replicator. It selfishly copies. Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going   I want to get copied.  But that it will get copied if it can  regardless of the consequences. It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't  because it's just information being copied. And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes  and so he said   Is there another replicator out there on the planet   Ah  yes  there is. Look around you    here will do  in this room. All around us  still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture  is another replicator. Information that we copy from person to person  by imitation  by language  by talking  by telling stories  by wearing clothes  by doing things. This is information copied with variation and selection. This is design process going on. He wanted a name for the new replicator. So  he took the Greek word  mimeme   which means that which is imitated. Remember that  that's the core definition  that which is imitated. And abbreviated it to meme  just because it sounds good and made a good meme  an effective spreading meme. So that's how the idea came about. It's important to stick with that definition. The whole science of memetics is much maligned  much misunderstood  much feared. But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition. A meme is not equivalent to an idea. It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else  really. Stick with the definition. It's that which is imitated  or information which is copied from person to person. So  let's see some memes. Well  you sir  you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself  or copied it from someone else  If you copied it from someone else  it's a meme. And what about  oh  I can't see any interesting memes here. All right everyone  who's got some interesting memes for me  Oh  well  your earrings  I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings. You probably went out and bought them. There are plenty more in the shops. That's something that's passed on from person to person. All the stories that we're telling    well  of course  TED is a great meme fest  masses of memes. The way to think about memes  though  is to think  why do they spread  They're selfish information  they will get copied  if they can. But some of them will be copied because they're good  or true  or useful  or beautiful. Some of them will be copied even though they're not. Some  it's quite hard to tell why. There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy. And I'm glad to say  as I expected  I found it when I came here  and I'm sure all of you found it  too. You go to your nice  posh  international hotel somewhere  and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom  and what do you see  Audience  Bathroom soap. SB  Pardon  Audience  Soap. SB  Soap  yeah. What else do you see  Audience   Inaudible  SB  Mmm mmm. Audience  Sink  toilet  SB  Sink  toilet  yes  these are all memes  they're all memes  but they're sort of useful ones  and then there's this one. What is this one doing  This has spread all over the world. It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here. But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in Assam. Who folded that thing up there  and why  Some people get carried away. Other people are just lazy and make mistakes. Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker. What is this all about  I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place  and it's all lovely. And you know  actually  all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place. So  think of it this way. Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes. The memes are all trying to get copied    trying  in inverted commas    i.e.  that's the shorthand for  if they can get copied  they will. They're using you and me as their propagating  copying machinery  and we are the meme machines. Now  why is this important  Why is this useful  or what does it tell us  It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human  all conventional theories of cultural evolution  of the origin of humans  and what makes us so different from other species. All other theories explaining the big brain  and language  and tool use and all these things that make us unique  are based upon genes. Language must have been useful for the genes. Tool use must have enhanced our survival  mating and so on. It always comes back  as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago  it always comes back to genes. The point of memetics is to say   Oh no  it doesn't.  There are two replicators now on this planet. From the moment that our ancestors  perhaps two and a half million years ago or so  began imitating  there was a new copying process. Copying with variation and selection. A new replicator was let loose  and it could never be    right from the start    it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature  could just copy the useful  beautiful  true things  and not copy the other things. While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy    lighting fires  keeping fires going  new techniques of hunting  these kinds of things    inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair  or wearing strange clothes  or painting their faces  or whatever. So  you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff  and the memes themselves  like the sounds that people made and copied    in other words  what turned out to be language    competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger. So  the big brain  on this theory  is driven by the memes. This is why  in  The Meme Machine   I called it memetic drive. As the memes evolve  as they inevitably must  they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving. This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains  that we like religion  and music  and art. Language is a parasite that we've adapted to  not something that was there originally for our genes  on this view. And like most parasites  it can begin dangerous  but then it coevolves and adapts  and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite. And so  from our perspective  we don't realize that that's how it began. So  this is a view of what humans are. All other species on this planet are gene machines only  they don't imitate at all well  hardly at all. We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well. The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine. But that's not all. We have a new kind of memes now. I've been wondering for a long time  since I've been thinking about memes a lot  is there a difference between the memes that we copy    the words we speak to each other  the gestures we copy  the human things    and all these technological things around us  I have always  until now  called them all memes  but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes. Let's call them techno memes or temes. Because the processes are getting different. We began  perhaps       years ago  with writing. We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet  but in order to get true temes and true teme machines  you need to get the variation  the selection and the copying  all done outside of humans. And we're getting there. We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there  that there are machines like that. And indeed  in the short time I've already been at TED  I see we're even closer than I thought we were before. So actually  now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines. Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read  learning to use machinery. We're going to have all kinds of implants  drugs that force us to stay awake all the time. We'll think we're choosing these things  but the temes are making us do it. So  we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet. Now  what about what else is going on out there in the universe  Is there anyone else out there  People have been asking this question for a long time. We've been asking it here at TED already. In       Frank Drake made his famous equation  but I think he concentrated on the wrong things. It's been very productive  that equation. He wanted to estimate N  the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy  and he included in there the rate of star formation  the rate of planets  but crucially  intelligence. I think that's the wrong way to think about it. Intelligence appears all over the place  in all kinds of guises. Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing. But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators  one feeding on the one before. So  I would suggest that we don't think intelligence  we think replicators. And on that basis  I've suggested a different kind of equation. A very simple equation. N  the same thing  the number of communicative civilizations out there  that  we might expect in our galaxy. Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy. The fraction of those which get a first replicator. The fraction of those that get the second replicator. The fraction of those that get the third replicator. Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out    sending information  sending probes  getting out there  and communicating with anywhere else. OK  so if we take that equation  why haven't we heard from anybody out there  Because every step is dangerous. Getting a new replicator is dangerous. You can pull through  we have pulled through  but it's dangerous. Take the first step  as soon as life appeared on this earth. We may take the Gaian view. I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday    it's not Gaian all the time. Actually  life forms produce things that kill themselves. Well  we did pull through on this planet. But then  a long time later  billions of years later  we got the second replicator  the memes. That was dangerous  all right. Think of the big brain. How many mothers do we have here  You know all about big brains. They are dangerous to give birth to  are agonizing to give birth to. My cat gave birth to four kittens  purring all the time. Ah  mm    slightly different. But not only is it painful  it kills lots of babies  it kills lots of mothers  and it's very expensive to produce. The genes are forced into producing all this myelin  all the fat to myelinate the brain. Do you know  sitting here  your brain is using about    percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight  It's a really expensive organ to run. Why  Because it's producing the memes. Now  it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off  and maybe it nearly did  but you see  we don't know. But maybe it nearly did. Has it been tried before  What about all those other species  Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left. What happened to the others  Could it be that this experiment in imitation  this experiment in a second replicator  is dangerous enough to kill people off  Well  we did pull through  and we adapted. But now  we're hitting  as I've just described  we're hitting the third replicator point. And this is even more dangerous    well  it's dangerous again. Why  Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us  or our planet  or anything else. They're just information  why would they  They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers  and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED. Don't think   Oh  we created the Internet for our own benefit.  That's how it seems to us. Think  temes spreading because they must. We are the old machines. Now  are we going to pull through  What's going to happen  What does it mean to pull through  Well  there are kind of two ways of pulling through. One that is obviously happening all around us now  is that the temes turn us into teme machines  with these implants  with the drugs  with us merging with the technology. And why would they do that  Because we are self replicating. We have babies. We make new ones  and so it's convenient to piggyback on us  because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable. Although it's closer  I heard this morning  it's closer than I thought it was. Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves. That way  it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized  and it was no longer possible for humans to live here. Because those teme machines  they wouldn't need    they're not squishy  wet  oxygen breathing  warmth requiring creatures. They could carry on without us. So  those are the two possibilities. The second  I don't think we're that close. It's coming  but we're not there yet. The first  it's coming too. But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is  that third danger point  getting a third replicator. And will we get through this third danger point  like we got through the second and like we got through the first  Maybe we will  maybe we won't. I have no idea. Chris Anderson  That was an incredible talk. SB  Thank you. I scared myself. CA   Laughter  So  I'm in Chile  in the Atacama desert  sitting in a hotel lobby  because that's the only place that I can get a Wi Fi connection  and I have this picture up on my screen  and a woman comes up behind me. She says   Oh  that's beautiful. What is it  Is that Jackson Pollock   And unfortunately  I can be a little too honest. I said   No  it's    it's penguin shit.  And  you know   Excuse me   And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. So  I said   No  no  really    it's penguin shit.  Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands taking pictures of penguins. This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical. So  literally  a few minutes before that  I downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation  which is really quite interesting  because it turns out you can model this as something called  Poiseuille flow   and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum. Actually  technically  it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. At this point  she stops me  and she says   Who are you  Wha    what do you do   And I was stuck  because I didn't have any way to describe what I do. And so  in some sense  this talk today is my answer to that. It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do. And it's very hard for me to make sense of it  so I'm not sure that you can. It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes    often at four in the morning. So  some people are afraid of what I do. Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano  and in response  I have ordered a bulletproof pocket protector. I'm not sure what these people think  because I don't speak Norsk. But I'm not thinking  monsteret  is a good thing. I don't know  you know  So  one of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations  and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to  you know  work backwards and say   Well  really  what were they thinking   And recently  I was in Easter Island  which is an incredibly beautiful place  and an incredibly mysterious place  because no matter where you go in Easter Island  you're struck by these statues  called the moai. The place is    square miles. They made  so far as we can tell      of them. Why on Earth  And if you haven't read Jared Diamond's book   Collapse   I totally recommend that you do. He's got a great chapter about it. Basically  these people committed ecological suicide in order to make more of these. And somewhere along the line  somebody said   I know  Let's cut down the last tree and commit suicide  because we need more identical statues.  And  one thing that isn't a mystery  actually  was when I grew up    because when I was a little kid  I'd seen these pictures    and I thought   Well  why that look on the face  Why that brow   I mean  it's such a powerful thing. Where did they get that inspiration  And then I met Yoyo  who is the native Rapa Nui an guide  and if you look at Yoyo's face  you kind of figure out where they got it. There's many mysteries  these statues. Everyone wants to know  how did they make them  how did they transport them  This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg. She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today. And she has studied the statues for    some years  and she has detailed records of every single statue. The one on the page here is the same that's up there. One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard. So  this used to be completely smooth. In fact  in many of the statues  when you excavate them  the backs are totally smooth    almost glass smooth. But after       years out in the weather  they look like this. Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all  and we're going to do a very high res digitization  first because it's a way of preserving them. Second  we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically  then  learn a few of the mysteries about them. How long have they been standing in what positions  And maybe  indirectly  get at some of the issues of what caused them to be the way they are. While I was in Easter Island  comet McNaught was there also  so you get a gratuitous picture of a moai with a comet. I also have an archaeological project going on in Egypt.  Going on  is perhaps a little bit strong. We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set  to get it going. So  I'll talk about it at a future TED. But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well. Another thing I do is I invent stuff. In fact  I design nuclear reactors. Not a joke. This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle. The red line is what is done in most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle. The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle  where you reprocess. Now  this is the normal way it's done. It's got the huge advantage that it does not create carbon pollution. It has a lot of disadvantages  each one of these steps is extremely expensive  it's potentially dangerous and they have the interesting property that the step cannot be performed in anyone's backyard  which is a problem. So  our reactor eliminates these steps  which  if we can actually make it work  is a really cool thing. Now  it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor. There's    no reactor's been even built to an old design  much less a new one  in the United States for    years. It's the kind of very high risk  but potentially very high return thing that we do. Changing into a totally different field  we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics  particularly in an area called metamaterials. A metamaterial is an artificial material  which manipulates  in this case  electromagnetic radiation  in a way that you couldn't otherwise. So  this device here is an invisibility cloak. It may not seem that  but if you were a microwave  this is how you would view it. Rays of light    in this case  microwave light    come in  and they just squish around the cell  and they come back the other side. Now  you could do that with mirrors from one angle. The cool thing is  this does it from all angles. Metamaterials  unfortunately    A  it only works on microwave  and B  it doesn't work all that well yet. But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field. It's    you know  today I'd like to say it's a zero billion dollar business  but  in fact  it's negative. But some day  some day  maybe it's going to work. We do a lot of work in biomedical fields. In this case  we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries. So  they say the eyes are the windows of the soul    turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff. And these happen to be my eyes  by the way. Now  I'm also very interested in cooking. While I was at Microsoft  I took a leave of absence and went to a chef school in France. I used to work  also while at Microsoft  at a leading restaurant in Seattle  so I do a lot of cooking. I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting  because it's one of these cult foods like chili  or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to    there's tremendous traditions  there's secrecy. And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach. So  this is my latest cooker  and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor  that's because it is. But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials    and of course  really the controller over there does it all on software    you can make some terrific ribs. This is a high speed centrifuge. You should all have one in your kitchen  beside your Turbochef. This subjects food to a force about        times that of normal gravity  and oh boy  does it clarify chicken stock. You would not believe it  I perform a series of ghoulish experiments on food    in this case  trying to calibrate a mathematical model so that one can predict exactly what the internal cooking times are. It turns out  A  it's useful  and for a geek like me  it's fun. Theory is red  black is experiment. So  I'm either really good at faking it  or this particular model seems to work. So  another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie  Contact   which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way. In fact  almost everybody in the movie is based on a real character  a real person. So  the Jodie Foster character here is actually this woman  Jill Tarter  and Jill has dedicated her life to this. You know  a lot of people risk their lives in a brief act of heroism  which is kind of cool  but Jill has what I call slow heroism. She is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years    may not ever. So  I like to support people that are risking their lives. After the movie came out  of course  there was a lot of interest in SETI. My kids saw the movie  and afterwards they came to me and they said   So  Dad  so    so    that character    that's Jill  right   I said   Oh  yeah  yeah    absolutely.   And that other person  that's someone      I said   Yes.  They said   Well  you know that creepy rich guy in the movie  Is that you   I said   Well  you know  it's just a movie  Come on.  So  the SETI Institute  with a little bit of help from me  and a lot of help from Paul Allen and a variety of other people  is building a dedicated radio telescope in Hat Creek  California  so they can do this SETI work. Now  I travel a lot  and I change cell phones a lot  and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is Jill  because I really don't want to miss  the call.  I mean  can you imagine  E.T.'s phoning home  and I'm not  like  there  You know  horrible  So  I do a lot of work on dinosaurs. I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs. And I resemble that remark. I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs  which is the finding of them. Now  to find dinosaurs  you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb  but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions  because wherever you have nice weather  plants grow  and you don't get any erosion  and you don't see any dinosaurs. So  you always find dinosaurs in deserts or badlands  areas that have very little plant growth and have flash floods in the spring. You know  skiers pray for snow  Paleontologists pray for erosion. So  you hike around and    this is after you dig them up  they look like this. You hike around  you see something like this. Now  this is something I found  so look at it very closely here. You've got this bentonite clay  which is    sort of swells up and expands. And there's some stuff poking out. So  you look at that  and you look up close  and you say   Well  gee  that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces   Well  if you look closely  you can recognize  actually  from the shape  that these are skull fragments. And then when you look at this  you say   That's a tooth. It's a big tooth.  It's about the size of a banana. It has a big serration on the edge. This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground. And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex  which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago. Now  this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room. Not the same one  actually. This is a cast  which I had bought  and then  after buying the cast  I found my own  and I don't have room for two. You know. So  the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs is that it is both an intellectual thing  because you're trying to reconstruct the environment of millions of years ago. It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways. The study of dinosaurs led to the realization that there's a problem with asteroid impact  for example. The study of dinosaurs may  literally  one day save the planet. Study of the ancient climate is very important. In fact  the Mesozoic  when dinosaurs lived  had much higher CO  than today  was much warmer than today  and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO  on climate. But  besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting  it's also very different than the other things I do  because you get to hike around in the badlands. This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like. This is one of my papers   A pygostyle from a non avian theropod.  It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex  so we're not going to go into it further. Now  I'm also really big on photography. I travel all over the world taking pictures    some of them good  most of them not. These days  bits are cheap. Unfortunately  that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them. Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands of king penguins on a beach. Here's a picture I took in Alaska  a few years ago  of Orcas. I'd gone up to photograph Orcas  and we had looked for a week  and we hadn't seen a damn Orca. And the last day  the sun comes out  the Orcas come  they're right by the boat. It's fantastic. And I get lots of pictures like this. Then  a little bit later  I start getting some pictures like this. Now  to a human audience  I need to explain that if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition  this would be the centerfold. It's true. So  there's more and more activity near the boat  and all of a sudden somebody shouts   What's that in the water   I said   Well  I think that's what you call a free willy.  There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. The first thing you learn is the overwhelming importance of hands. They don't have them. I think Paul Simon is in the audience  and he has    he may not realize it  but he wrote a song all about whale sex   Slip Slidin' Away.  That's kind of what it's like. The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex  they curl their toes too. So    where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together  You know  there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in finding a great thing  passion in life  and focusing all your energy on it  and I've never been able to do that. I just    you know  because  yes  I'll focus passion on something  but then there will be something else  and then there's something else again. And for a long time I fought this  and I thought   Well  gee  I really ought to buckle down.  And you know  when I was at Microsoft  that was so engrossing  and the whole industry was expanding so much  that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. But ultimately  I decided that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am  but embrace it. And say   Yeah  you know  I    this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep  but that's really what works for me.  And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors or metamaterials or whale sex  the common    or lowest common denominator    is me. That's it  thank you. You know  culture was born of the imagination  and the imagination    the imagination as we know it    came into being when our species descended from our progenitor  Homo erectus  and  infused with consciousness  began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world. For a time  we shared the stage with our distant cousins  Neanderthal  who clearly had some spark of awareness  but    whether it was the increase in the size of the brain  or the development of language  or some other evolutionary catalyst    we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival. By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe         years ago  our direct ancestors had already  and for       years  been crawling into the belly of the earth  where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles  they had brought into being the great art of the Upper Paleolithic. And I spent two months in the caves of southwest France with the poet Clayton Eshleman  who wrote a beautiful book called  Juniper Fuse.  And you could look at this art and you could  of course  see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being. But more importantly  it spoke of a deeper yearning  something far more sophisticated than hunting magic. And the way Clayton put it was this way. He said   You know  clearly at some point  we were all of an animal nature  and at some point  we weren't.  And he viewed proto shamanism as a kind of original attempt  through ritual  to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost. So  he saw this art not as hunting magic  but as postcards of nostalgia. And viewed in that light  it takes on a whole other resonance. And the most amazing thing about the Upper Paleolithic art is that as an aesthetic expression  it lasted for almost        years. If these were postcards of nostalgia  ours was a very long farewell indeed. And it was also the beginning of our discontent  because if you wanted to distill all of our experience since the Paleolithic  it would come down to two words  how and why. And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged. Now  all people share the same raw  adaptive imperatives. We all have children. We all have to deal with the mystery of death  the world that waits beyond death  the elders who fall away into their elderly years. All of this is part of our common experience  and this shouldn't surprise us  because  after all  biologists have finally proven it to be true  something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true. And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters. We are all cut from the same genetic cloth. All of humanity  probably  is descended from a thousand people who left Africa roughly        years ago. But the corollary of that is that  if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material  all human populations share the same raw human genius  the same intellectual acuity. And so whether that genius is placed into    technological wizardry has been the great achievement of the West    or by contrast  into unraveling the complex threads of memory inherent in a myth  is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation. There is no progression of affairs in human experience. There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex and descends down the flanks to the so called primitives of the world. All peoples are simply cultural options  different visions of life itself. But what do I mean by different visions of life making for completely different possibilities for existence  Well  let's slip for a moment into the greatest culture sphere ever brought into being by the imagination  that of Polynesia.        square kilometers  tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea. I recently sailed on the Hokulea  named after the sacred star of Hawaii  throughout the South Pacific to make a film about the navigators. These are men and women who  even today  can name     stars in the night sky. These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls of islands beyond the visible horizon  simply by watching the reverberation of waves across the hull of their vessel  knowing full well that every island group in the Pacific has its unique refractive pattern that can be read with the same perspicacity with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint. These are sailors who in the darkness  in the hull of the vessel  can distinguish as many as    different sea swells moving through the canoe at any one point in time  distinguishing local wave disturbances from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean  that can be followed with the same ease that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea. Indeed  if you took all of the genius that allowed us to put a man on the moon and applied it to an understanding of the ocean  what you would get is Polynesia. And if we slip from the realm of the sea into the realm of the spirit of the imagination  you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism. And I recently made a film called  The Buddhist Science of the Mind.  Why did we use that word  science  What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth  What is Buddhism but       years of empirical observation as to the nature of mind  I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend  Matthieu Ricard  and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us here once at TED   Western science is a major response to minor needs.  We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be     without losing our teeth. The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence. Our billboards celebrate naked children in underwear. Their billboards are manuals  prayers to the well being of all sentient creatures. And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche  we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination  accompanied by a great doctor. And the destination was a single room in a nunnery  where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat    years before. And en route  we took darshan from Rinpoche  and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths  the essence of the Buddhist path. All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative. It means things happen. The cause of suffering is ignorance. By that  the Buddha did not mean stupidity  he meant clinging to the illusion that life is static and predictable. The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome. And the fourth and most important  of course  was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart  but had       years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty. And so  when this door opened onto the face of a woman who had not been out of that room in    years  you did not see a mad woman. You saw a woman who was more clear than a pool of water in a mountain stream. And of course  this is what the Tibetan monks told us. They said  at one point  you know  we don't really believe you went to the moon  but you did. You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime  but we do. And if we move from the realm of the spirit to the realm of the physical  to the sacred geography of Peru    I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people that literally believe that the Earth is alive  responsive to all of their aspirations  all of their needs. And  of course  the human population has its own reciprocal obligations. I spent    years living amongst the people of Chinchero and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in. Once each year  the fastest young boy in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman. And for one day  he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite  a waylaka. And for that day  he leads all able bodied men on a run  but it's not your ordinary run. You start off at        feet. You run down to the base of the sacred mountain  Antakillqa. You run up to        feet  descend       feet. Climb again over the course of    hours. And of course  the waylakama spin  the trajectory of the route  is marked by holy mounds of Earth  where coke is given to the Earth  libations of alcohol to the wind  the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop. And the metaphor is clear  you go into the mountain as an individual  but through exhaustion  through sacrifice  you emerge as a community that has once again reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet. And at     I was the only outsider ever to go through this  only one to finish it. I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the       year history of the plant. But these localized rituals become pan Andean  and these fantastic festivals  like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i  which occurs when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky. It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock         Indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley  called the Sinakara  which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier. The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community  in this wonderful fusion of Christian and pre Columbian ideas. You place the cross into the ice  in the shadow of Ausangate  the most sacred of all Apus  or sacred mountains of the Inca. And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses. Now  these ideas and these events allow us even to deconstruct iconic places that many of you have been to  like Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu was never a lost city. On the contrary  it was completely linked in to the        kilometers of royal roads the Inca made in less than a century. But more importantly  it was linked in to the Andean notions of sacred geography. The intiwatana  the hitching post to the sun  is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu  which is Sugarloaf Mountain  called Huayna Picchu. If you come to the south of the intiwatana  you find an altar. Climb Huayna Picchu  find another altar. Take a direct north south bearing  you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone  goes to the skyline  hits the heart of Salcantay  the second of the most important mountains of the Incan empire. And then beyond Salcantay  of course  when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky  directly in that same alignment  the Milky Way overhead. But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below  The sacred river  the Urubamba  or the Vilcanota  which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way  but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being. And where does the river rise  Right on the slopes of the Koariti. So      years after Columbus  these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual. Now  when I was here at the first TED  I showed this photograph  two men of the Elder Brothers  the descendants  survivors of El Dorado. These  of course  are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization. If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood  but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary. Taken from their families  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for    years    two nine year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb. All that time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as they are taught the values of their society. Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers  and their prayers alone  maintain the cosmic balance. Now  the measure of a society is not only what it does  but the quality of its aspirations. And I always wanted to go back into these mountains  to see if this could possibly be true  as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist  Reichel Dolmatoff. So  literally two weeks ago  I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life. These really are a people who live and breathe the realm of the sacred  a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome. They consume more coca leaves than any human population  half a pound per man  per day. The gourd you see here is    everything in their lives is symbolic. Their central metaphor is a loom. They say   Upon this loom  I weave my life.  They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient as  threads.  When they pray for the dead  they make these gestures with their hands  spinning their thoughts into the heavens. You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd. The gourd is a feminine aspect  the stick is a male. You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes    well  they're not ashes  they're burnt limestone    to empower the coca leaf  to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride. But if you break a gourd  you cannot simply throw it away  because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium  the measure of a man's life  has a thought behind it. Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way  that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women. The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically  you turn it on the side  and you have a piece of cloth. And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization  the greatest goldsmiths of South America  who in the wake of the conquest  retreated into this isolated volcanic massif that soars to        feet above the Caribbean coastal plain. There are four societies  the Kogi  the Wiwa  the Kankwano and the Arhuacos. I traveled with the Arhuacos  and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man  Danilo Villafane    if we just jump back here for a second. When I first met Danilo  in the Colombian embassy in Washington  I couldn't help but say   You know  you look a lot like an old friend of mine.  Well  it turns out he was the son of my friend  Adalberto  from       who had been killed by the FARC. And I said   Danilo  you won't remember this  but when you were an infant  I carried you on my back  up and down the mountains.  And because of that  Danilo invited us to go to the very heart of the world  a place where no journalist had ever been permitted. Not simply to the flanks of the mountains  but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims. And this man sitting cross legged is now a grown up Eugenio  a man who I've known since     . And this is one of those initiates. No  it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for    years  but they are kept within the confines of the ceremonial men's circle for    years. This little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men's hut for all that time  until he begins his journey of initiation. For that entire time  the world only exists as an abstraction  as he is taught the values of society  including this notion that their prayers alone maintain the cosmic balance. Before we could begin our journey  we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth. And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest. And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet    there must be nothing between the feet and the Earth for a mamo. And this is actually the place where the Great Mother sent the spindle into the world that elevated the mountains and created the homeland that they call the heart of the world. We traveled high into the paramo  and as we crested the hills  we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity. And then of course  as we reached our final destination  a place called Mamancana  we were in for a surprise  because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us. And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts  hidden away until the darkness. And then  abandoning all our gear  we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night  in a quite dramatic scene. It's going to look like a John Ford Western. And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn  so it was quite harrowing. It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating is that the minute there was a sense of dangers  the mamos went into a circle of divination. And of course  this is a photograph literally taken the night we were in hiding  as they divine their route to take us out of the mountains. We were able to  because we had trained people in filmmaking  continue with our work  and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film  and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea  taking the elements from the highlands to the sea. And here you see how their sacred landscape has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos  and yet  still they pray. And it's an amazing thing to think that this close to Miami  two hours from Miami  there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well being. They call themselves the Elder Brothers. They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the Earth. Now  if we slip to another end of the world  I was up in the high Arctic to tell a story about global warming  inspired in part by the former Vice President's wonderful book. And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit    a people who don't fear the cold  but take advantage of it. A people who find a way  with their imagination  to carve life out of that very frozen. A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death  but an affirmation of life. And yet tragically  when you now go to those northern communities  you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July  in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland  it literally comes in now in November and stays until March. So  their entire year has been cut in half. Now  I want to stress that none of these peoples that I've been quickly talking about here are disappearing worlds. These are not dying peoples. On the contrary  you know  if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see  you discover that the world is not flat. The world remains a rich tapestry. It remains a rich topography of the spirit. These myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being new  failed attempts at being modern. They're unique facets of the human imagination. They're unique answers to a fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And when asked that question  they respond with       different voices. And collectively  those voices become our human repertoire for dealing with the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. Our industrial society is scarcely     years old. That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone that we have all of the answers for all of the questions that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us. They are unique answers to that fundamental question  what does it mean to be human and alive  And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth  taking with it not only plants and animals  but the legacy of humanity's brilliance. Right now  as we sit here in this room  of those       languages spoken the day that you were born  fully half aren't being taught to children. So  you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual  social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away. This does not have to happen. These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern    quaint and colorful and destined to fade away as if by natural law. In every case  these are dynamic  living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces. That's actually an optimistic observation  because it suggests that if human beings are the agents of cultural destruction  we can also be  and must be  the facilitators of cultural survival. Thank you very much. Last year  I told you the story  in seven minutes  of Project Orion  which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked  but it had this one year political window where it could have happened. So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen. This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing. This was a perfect introduction. And it's a story that did work. It did happen  and the machines are all around us. And it was a technology that was inevitable. If the people I'm going to tell you the story about  if they hadn't done it  somebody else would have. So  it was sort of the right idea at the right time. This is Barricelli's universe. This is the universe we live in now. It's the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things  including changing biology. I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity  which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED  it brought a whole lot of very smart people together. And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam  Richard Feynman and John von Neumann. And it was Von Neumann who said  after the bomb  he was working on something much more important than bombs  he's thinking about computers. So  he wasn't only thinking about them  he built one. This is the machine he built. He built this machine  and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works  with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back. The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes  who  in       explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing  and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic  you can do it all with arithmetic. He said you needed addition and subtraction. Leibniz  who came a little bit later    this is         showed that you didn't even need subtraction. You could do the whole thing with addition. Here  we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution. And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine. He talked about doing it with marbles  having gates and what we now call shift registers  where you shift the gates  drop the marbles down the tracks. And that's what all these machines are doing  except  instead of doing it with marbles  they're doing it with electrons. And then we jump to Von Neumann        when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing. And       after the war  the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine. So June         actually  the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet    and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing  which also goes back to Turing  who  before that  gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless  little  finite state machine  just reading a tape in and reading a tape out. The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather. Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people  giving them each a little chunk  and putting it together. Here  we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will  but capable of only two ideas. And that's really the simplest computer. It's basically why you need the qubit  because it only has two ideas. And you put lots of those together  you get the essentials of the modern computer  the arithmetic unit  the central control  the memory  the recording medium  the input and the output. But  there's one catch. This is the fatal    you know  we saw it in starting these programs up. The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail. So  the programming has to be perfect  or it won't work. If you look at the origins of this  the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here. But actually  the machine I'm going to tell you about  the Institute for Advanced Study machine  which is way up there  really should be down there. So  I'm trying to revise history  and give some of these guys more credit than they've had. Such a computer would open up universes  which are  at the present  outside the range of any instruments. So it opens up a whole new world  and these people saw it. The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle  Vladimir Zworykin  from RCA. RCA  in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time  decided not to go into computers. But the first meetings  November       were at RCA's offices. RCA started this whole thing off  and said  you know  televisions are the future  not computers. The essentials were all there    all the things that make these machines run. Von Neumann  and a logician  and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then  they needed a place to build it. When RCA said no  that's when they decided to build it in Princeton  where Freeman works at the Institute. That's where I grew up as a kid. That's me  that's my sister Esther  who's talked to you before  so we both go back to the birth of this thing. That's Freeman  a long time ago  and that was me. And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern  who wrote the  Theory of Games.  All these forces came together there  in Princeton. Oppenheimer  who had built the bomb. The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations. And Julian Bigelow  who took Zworkykin's place as the engineer  to actually figure out  using electronics  how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this  and women in front  who actually did most of the coding  were the first programmers. These were the prototype geeks  the nerds. They didn't fit in at the Institute. This is a letter from the director  concerned about     especially unfair on the matter of sugar.  You can read the text. This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time. These were not theoretical physicists. They were real soldering gun type guys  and they actually built this thing. And we take it for granted now  that each of these machines has billions of transistors  doing billions of cycles per second without failing. They were using vacuum tubes  very narrow  sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes. They actually used  J   the common radio tube  because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes. And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way. Reports were issued  so that this machine was cloned at    other places around the world. And it really was. It was the original microprocessor. All the computers now are copies of that machine. The memory was in cathode ray tubes    a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube    very  very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances. So  there's    of these tubes  like a V    engine running the memory. The input and the output was by teletype tape at first. This is a wire drive  using bicycle wheels. This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now. Then they switched to a magnetic drum. This is modifying IBM equipment  which is the origins of the whole data processing industry  later at IBM. And this is the beginning of computer graphics. The  Graph'g Beam Turn On.  This next slide  that's the    as far as I know    the first digital bitmap display      . So  Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud  doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components. Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks  trying to get this thing to work  with all these       vacuum tubes that failed half the time. And that's what I've been doing  this last six months  is going through the logs.  Running time  two minutes. Input  output     minutes.  This includes a large amount of human error. So they are always trying to figure out  what's machine error  What's human error  What's code  what's hardware  That's an engineer gazing at tube number     trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus. He had to focus the memory    seems OK. So  he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running  let alone having  you know  software problems.  No use  went home.   Laughter   Impossible to follow the damn thing  where's a directory   So  already  they're complaining about the manuals   before closing down in disgust ...    The General Arithmetic  Operating Logs.  Burning lots of midnight oil.  MANIAC   which became the acronym for the machine  Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator   lost its memory.   MANIAC regained its memory  when the power went off.   Machine or human    Aha   So  they figured out it's a code problem.  Found trouble in code  I hope.   Code error  machine not guilty.   Damn it  I can be just as stubborn as this thing.   And the dawn came.  So they ran all night. Twenty four hours a day  this thing was running  mainly running bomb calculations.  Everything up to this point is wasted time.   What's the use  Good night.   Master control off. The hell with it. Way off.   Laughter   Something's wrong with the air conditioner    smell of burning V belts in the air.   A short    do not turn the machine on.   IBM machine putting a tar like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.  So they really were working under tough conditions. Here   A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack  set blower to vibrating. Result  no more mouse.   Here lies mouse. Born   . Died       a.m.  May     .  There's an inside joke someone has penciled in   Here lies Marston Mouse.  If you're a mathematician  you get that  because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.  Picked a lightning bug off the drum.   Running at two kilocycles.  That's two thousand cycles per second     yes  I'm chicken     so two kilocycles was slow speed. The high speed was    kilocycles. I don't know if you remember a Mac that was    Megahertz  that's slow speed.  I have now duplicated both results. How will I know which is right  assuming one result is correct  This now is the third different output. I know when I'm licked.   We've duplicated errors before.   Machine run  fine. Code isn't.   Only happens when the machine is running.  And sometimes things are okay.  Machine a thing of beauty  and a joy forever.   Perfect running.   Parting thought  when there's bigger and better errors  we'll have them.  So  nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs. They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook  late one night  finally drew a bomb. So  that was the result. It was Mike  the first thermonuclear bomb  in     . That was designed on that machine  in the woods behind the Institute. So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems. Barricelli  he came to do what we now call  really  artificial life  trying to see if  in this artificial universe    he was a viral geneticist  way  way  way ahead of his time. He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now. Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer. Began    his universe started March    '  . So it's almost exactly    it's    years ago next Tuesday  I guess. And he saw everything in terms of    he could read the binary code straight off the machine. He had a wonderful rapport. Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him. Even errors were duplicated.  Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong  code is right.  So he designed this universe  and ran it. When the bomb people went home  he was allowed in there. He would run that thing all night long  running these things  if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram  who reinvented this stuff. And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared. It was published in the literature.  If it's that easy to create living organisms  why not create a few yourself   So  he decided to give it a try  to start this artificial biology going in the machines. And he found all these  sort of    it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny        byte universe  and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world  in biology. This is some of the generations of his universe. But they're just going to stay numbers  they're not going to become organisms. They have to have something. You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype. They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that  started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with    playing chess with other machines and so on. And they did start to evolve. And he went around the country after that. Every time there was a new  fast machine  he started using it  and saw exactly what's happening now. That the programs  instead of being turned off    when you quit the program  you'd keep running and  basically  all the sorts of things like Windows is doing  running as a multi cellular organism on many machines  he envisioned all that happening. And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process. It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence  but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence. And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike  or a new kind of life. It just was another version of the same thing happening. And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago. And could you do it again now  So  when I went into these archives looking at this stuff  lo and behold  the archivist came up one day  saying   I think we found another box that had been thrown out.  And it was his universe on punch cards. So there it is     years later  sitting there    sort of suspended animation. That's the instructions for running    this is actually the source code for one of those universes  with a note from the engineers saying they're having some problems.  There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet.  And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity. What's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive  These cards  now  thanks to me showing up  are being saved. And the question is  should we run them or not  You know  could we get them running  Do you want to let it loose on the Internet  These machines would think they    these organisms  if they came back to life now    whether they've died and gone to heaven  there's a universe. My laptop is    thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project. He was thinking far ahead  to how this would really grow into a new kind of life. And that's what's happening  When Juan Enriquez told us about these    trillion bits being transferred back and forth  of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab  that's what Barricelli imagined  that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code    it already is coding from nucleic acids. We've been doing that since  you know  since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA. And real soon  we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins  and  like Steve showed us  that just opens an entirely new world. It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned. This was published after he died  his sort of unfinished notes on self reproducing machines  what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce. It took really three people  Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing  Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines    that now  last count  four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every    hours  and Julian Bigelow  who died    days ago    this is John Markoff's obituary for him    he was the important missing link  the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work. And all our computers have  inside them  the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day  sort of on pencil and paper. And we owe a tremendous credit to that. And he explained  in a very generous way  the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '  s to do this project  and make it freely available with no patents  no restrictions  no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world. That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down  July     . And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off. And that's the end. Thank you very much. My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously  on a collective level. And what I mean by that  it's the behaviors that we're in denial about  and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness. And as individuals  we all do these things  all the time  everyday. It's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else. Or when you drink a little too much at a party  just out of anxiety. Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt  or whatever. And when we do these kind of things  when     million people do unconscious behaviors  then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence that nobody wants  and no one intended. And that's what I look at with my photographic work. This is an image I just recently completed  that is    when you stand back at a distance  it looks like some kind of neo Gothic  cartoon image of a factory spewing out pollution. And as you get a little bit closer  it starts looking like lots of pipes  like maybe a chemical plant  or a refinery  or maybe a hellish freeway interchange. And as you get all the way up close  you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups. And in fact  this is one million plastic cups  which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the United States every six hours. We use four million cups a day on airline flights  and virtually none of them are reused or recycled. They just don't do that in that industry. Now  that number is dwarfed by the number of paper cups we use every day  and that is    million cups a day for hot beverages  most of which is coffee. I couldn't fit    million cups on a canvas  but I was able to put        . That's what         cups looks like. That's    minutes of our cup consumption. And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life  that's the size it would be. And there's an hour's worth of our cups. And there's a day's worth of our cups. You can still see the little people way down there. That's as high as a    story building  and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference. Speaking of justice  there's another phenomenon going on in our culture that I find deeply troubling  and that is that America  right now  has the largest percentage of its population in prison of any country on Earth. One out of four people  one out of four humans in prison are Americans  imprisoned in our country. And I wanted to show the number. The number is  .  million Americans were incarcerated in     . And that's gone up since then  but we don't have the numbers yet. So  I wanted to show  .  million prison uniforms  and in the actual print of this piece  each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge. They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material  and to show  .  million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print. And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are    feet tall by    feet wide. This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York    those are my parents looking at the piece. Every time I look at this piece  I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad   He finally folded his laundry.  I want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction. And this particular one is about cigarette addiction. I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking. More than         people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes. And so  this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes. And  as you slowly step back  you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh  called  Skull with Cigarette.  It's a strange thing to think about  that on       when that tragedy happened        Americans died. And do you remember the response  It reverberated around the world  and will continue to reverberate through time. It will be something that we talk about in     years. And yet on that same day        Americans died from smoking. And the day after that  another       Americans died from smoking. And every single day since then        Americans have died. And today        Americans are dying from cigarette smoking. And we aren't talking about it    we dismiss it. The tobacco lobby  it's too strong. We just dismiss it out of our consciousness. And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes  we continue to allow our children  our sons and daughters  to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking. And this is what the next piece is about. This is just lots and lots of cigarettes         cigarettes  which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month  and every month in the U.S. More than         children in the United States aged    and under begin smoking every year. One more strange epidemic in the United States that I want to acquaint you with is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs. This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin. Well  actually  I only had one Vicodin that I scanned lots and lots of times. And so  as you stand back  you see         Vicodin pills  which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the United States  attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti anxiety medications. One third of all drug overdoses in the U.S.    and that includes cocaine  heroin  alcohol  everything    one third of drug overdoses are prescription medications. A strange phenomenon. This is a piece that I just recently completed about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon  this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.         women  American women  last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery. It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift  given to young girls who are about to go off to college. So  I made this image out of Barbie dolls  and so  as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern  and as you get all the way back  you see        Barbie dolls  which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the U.S. each month. The vast majority of those are on women under the age of   . And strangely enough  the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction  and most of that is being done by men. Now  I want to emphasize that these are just examples. I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues. They're just examples. And the reason that I do this  it's because I have this fear that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now. There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment. We've lost our sense of outrage  our anger and our grief about what's going on in our culture right now  what's going on in our country  the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world. They've gone missing  these feelings have gone missing. Our cultural joy  our national joy is nowhere to be seen. And one of the causes of this  I think  is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview  this holoptical worldview  this holographic image that we're all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things  the environmental footprints       miles away of the things that we buy  the social consequences        miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers. As we try to build this view  and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture  the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers  numbers in the millions  in the hundreds of millions  in the billions and now in the trillions. Bush's new budget is in the trillions  and these are numbers that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend. We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics. And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work  is to take these numbers  these statistics from the raw language of data  and to translate them into a more universal visual language  that can be felt. Because my belief is  if we can feel these issues  if we can feel these things more deeply  then they'll matter to us more than they do now. And if we can find that  then we'll be able to find  within each one of us  what it is that we need to find to face the big question  which is  how do we change  That  to me  is the big question that we face as a people right now  how do we change  How do we change as a culture  and how do we each individually take responsibility for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of  and that is our own behavior  My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues. I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way. I'm simply saying  this is who we are right now. And if there are things that we see that we don't like about our culture  then we have a choice. The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface  to bring to this question  the depth of character that we can summon  as we show up for the question of how do we change    it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation  and it will continue to do that  on into the future. And it will profoundly affect the well being  the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions. I'm not speaking abstractly about this  I'm speaking    this is who we are in this room  right now  in this moment. Thank you and good afternoon. One way to change our genes is to make new ones  as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown. Another is to change our lifestyles. And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be  that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits. When you eat healthier  manage stress  exercise and love more  your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen. But more than that  your brain gets measurably bigger. Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now. This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us. Now  there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells. Some of my favorite things  like chocolate and tea  blueberries  alcohol in moderation  stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana. I'm just the messenger. What were we just talking about  And other things that can make it worse  that can cause you to lose brain cells. The usual suspects  like saturated fat and sugar  nicotine  opiates  cocaine  too much alcohol and chronic stress. Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle  so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much. Your heart gets more blood flow. We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease. That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left  after only a year become measurably less clogged. And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left  the blue means no blood flow. A year later    orange and white is maximum blood flow. We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and  by extension  breast cancer  simply by making these changes. We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited    percent in the group that made these changes  whereas only nine percent in the comparison group. These differences were highly significant. Even your sexual organs get more blood flow  so you increase sexual potency. One of the most effective anti smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services  showing that nicotine  which constricts your arteries  can cause a heart attack or a stroke  but it also causes impotence. Half of guys who smoke are impotent. How sexy is that  Now we're also about to publish a study    the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer. This is what's called a heat map    and the different colors    and along the side  on the right  are different genes. And we found that over     genes were favorably changed    in effect  turning on the good genes  the disease preventing genes  turning off the disease promoting genes. And so these findings I think are really very powerful  giving many people new hope and new choices. And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and   andMe  that are giving you your genetic profiles  are giving some people a sense of   Gosh  well  what can I do about it   Well  our genes are not our fate  and if we make these changes    they're a predisposition    but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise  we can actually change how our genes are expressed. Thank you. Welcome. If I could have the first slide  please  Contrary to calculations made by some engineers  bees can fly  dolphins can swim  and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now  what I want to do  in the short time I have  is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design. I get to do this all the time  and it's just incredible. I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation. The challenge of looking at nature's designs    and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it  and the way we've used it. The challenge  of course  is to answer this question  what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere  And if we could figure that out  how can we implement those designs  Well  many biologists will tell engineers  and others  organisms have millions of years to get it right  they're spectacular  they can do everything wonderfully well. So  the answer is bio mimicry  just copy nature directly. We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do    because evolution works on the just good enough principle  not on a perfecting principle. And the constraints in building any organism  when you look at it  are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints. Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile  but it had to start off to be this big  then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way. Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile  I'll tell you that you also    inside it    have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. And you can absolutely never  absolutely never  because of history and the inherited plan  start with a clean slate. So  organisms have this important history. Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer. And this is really important when you begin to look at animals. Instead  we believe you need to be inspired by biology. You need to discover the general principles of nature  and then use these analogies when they're advantageous. This is a real challenge to do this  because animals  when you start to really look inside them    how they work    appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history of the design plans  you can't go look it up anywhere. They have way too many motions for their joints  too many muscles. Even the simplest animal we think of  something like an insect  and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. How can you make sense of this  Well  we believed    and we hypothesized    that one way animals could work simply  is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves. What we discovered was that two   four   six  and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move. They all work like this kangaroo  they bounce. And they can be modeled by a spring mass system that we call the spring mass system because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick. They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true  Well  a human  one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog  or works like three legs  together as one  of a trotting insect  or four legs as one of a trotting crab. And then they alternate in their propulsion  but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way    you'll see next week  I'll give you a hint  there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things like T. rex probably couldn't do this  but you'll see that next week. Now  what's interesting is the animals  then    we said    bounce along the vertical plane this way  and in our collaborations with Pixar  in  A Bug's Life   we discussed the bipedal nature of the characters of the ants. And we told them  of course  they move in another plane as well. And they asked us this question. They say   Why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane  when you're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane   This is a good question. Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way. We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs  we collapsed them down as one. We got some of the best mathematicians in the world from Princeton to work on this problem. And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down  but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time. And many organisms fit this kind of pattern. Now  why is this important to have this model  Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it  you give it a push  as it bumps into something  it self stabilizes  with no brain or no reflexes  just by the structure alone. It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. That's enough  The animals  when you look at them running  appear to be self stabilizing like this  using basically springy legs. That is  the legs can do computations on their own  the control algorithms  in a sense  are embedded in the form of the animal itself. Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries  Well  I would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies  at least they have been so far. Think about the typical kind of robot that you see. Human technologies have tended to be large  flat  with right angles  stiff  made of metal. They have rolling devices and axles. There are very few motors  very few sensors. Whereas nature tends to be small  and curved  and it bends and twists  and has legs instead  and appendages  and has many muscles and many  many sensors. So it's a very different design. However  what's changing  what's really exciting    and I'll show you some of that next    is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature  then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. And here's one example that's really exciting. This is a collaboration we have with Stanford. And they developed this new technique  called Shape Deposition Manufacturing. It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like  and put in the material properties. They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself. For example  here's a leg  the clear part is stiff  the white part is compliant  and you don't need any axles there or anything. It just bends by itself beautifully. So  you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl. Our work has also inspired another robot  a biologically inspired bouncing robot  from the University of Michigan and McGill named RHex  for robot hexapod  and this one's autonomous. Let's go to the video  and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries. Here's what some of you did this morning  although you did it outside  not on a treadmill. Here's what we do. This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach you think you don't have in your kitchen. This is an eight legged scorpion  six legged ant  forty four legged centipede. Now  I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks    they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that in this ghost crab  from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina. It goes up to four meters per second when it runs. It actually leaps into the air  and has aerial phases when it does it  like a horse  and you'll see it's bouncing here. What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like Richard  or a cockroach  or a crab  or a kangaroo  the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far. Now  what good are springy legs then  What can they do  Well  we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability. So  we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at. And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did. The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down  It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all. We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple  springy legs  you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured robot  named Sprawl. It has six legs    there are the tuned  springy legs. It moves in a gait that an insect uses  and here it is going on the treadmill. Now  what's important about this robot  compared to other robots  is that it can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it doesn't have a brain  yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever. It's this technique of building the properties into the form. This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project    very robust  if a graduate student does that to his thesis project. This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex  making its first outing in a demo. Same principle  it only has six moving parts  six motors  but it has springy  tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect. It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front  and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod  and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. Robert Full  It'll go on different surfaces    here's sand    although we haven't perfected the feet yet  but I'll talk about that later. Here's RHex entering the woods. Again  this robot can't see anything  it can't feel anything  it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system  with very simple parts  but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal. I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA  and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice  and life  ultimately  on Mars. And he said    especially with legged robots  because they're way too complicated. Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them we should go to Mars in       I tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on Mars. Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance  and can go anywhere  is because they have an effective interaction with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you  that we studied to look at this  is the gecko. We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on. Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video. One of the animals is going to be running on the level  and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which  They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left is running up the wall  Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell  isn't it  It's incredible  we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell. They can run up a wall at a meter a second     steps per second  and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this  It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill. How do they do this  They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out  and then peel off the surface  like tape. Like if we had a piece of tape now  we'd peel it this way. They do this with their toes. It's bizarre  This peeling inspired iRobot    that we work with    to build Mecho Geckos. Here's a legged version and a tractor version  or a bulldozer version. Let's see some of the geckos move with some video  and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots. Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes  in real time. There it goes again. Obviously  we have to slow this down a little bit. You can't use regular cameras. You have to take       pictures per second to see this. And here's some video at       frames per second. Now  I want you to look at the animal's back. Do you see how much it's bending like that  We can't figure that out    that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works. If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley  come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay  send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill. It's a see through treadmill with a see through treadmill belt  so we can watch the animal's feet  and videotape them through the treadmill belt  to see how they move. Here's the animal that we have here  running on a vertical surface. Pick a foot and try to watch a toe  and see if you can see what the animal's doing. See it uncurl and then peel these toes. It can do this in    milliseconds. It's unbelievable. Here are the robots that they inspire  the Mecho Geckos from iRobot. First we'll see the animals toes peeling    look at that. And here's the peeling action of the Mecho Gecko. It uses a pressure sensitive adhesive to do it. Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho Gecko    that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface  transition to a wall  and then go onto a ceiling. There's the bulldozer version. Now  it doesn't use pressure sensitive glue. The animal does not use that. But that's what we're limited to  at the moment. What does the animal do  The animal has weird toes. And if you look at the toes  they have these little leaves there  and if you blow them up and zoom in  you'll see that's there's little striations in these leaves. And if you zoom in     times  you'll see it looks like a rug. And if you blow that up  and zoom in     times  you see there are hairs there  tiny hairs. And if you look carefully  those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those        times  you'll see each hair has split ends. And if you blow those up  they have these little structures on the end. The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae  and an animal like that has one billion of these nano size split ends  to get very close to the surface. In fact  there's the diameter of your hair    a gecko has two million of these  and each hair has     to       split ends. Think of the contact of that that's possible. We were fortunate to work with another group at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor  that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair. Here's an individual hair with a little split end there. When we measured the forces  they were enormous. They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size    the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child  about    pounds  easily. Now  how do they do it  We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction  No  force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics  No  you can change the charge    they still hold on. Do they do it by interlocking  That's kind of a like a Velcro like thing. No  you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces    they don't do it. How about suction  They stick on in a vacuum. How about wet adhesion  Or capillary adhesion  They don't have any glue  and they even stick under water just fine. If you put their foot under water  they grab on. How do they do it then  Believe it or not  they grab on by intermolecular forces  by Van der Waals forces. You know  you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry  where you had these two atoms  they're close together  and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures. What we're doing is  we're taking that inspiration of the hairs  and with another colleague at Berkeley  we're manufacturing them. And just recently we've made a breakthrough  where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic  self cleaning  dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. We also presented to Nike even. We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small size scale    and where everything gets sticky  and gravity doesn't matter anymore    we needed to look at ants and their feet  because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well. But the ants do  and we'll figure out why  so that ultimately we'll make this move. And imagine  you're going to be able to have swarms of these six millimeter robots available to run around. Where's this going  I think you can see it already. Clearly  the Internet is already having eyes and ears  you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands. You're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots  so that you can run  fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish. So  in conclusion  I think the message is clear. If you need a message  if nature's not enough  if you care about search and rescue  or mine clearance  or medicine  or the various things we're working on  we must preserve nature's designs  otherwise these secrets will be lost forever. Thank you. This is a work in process  based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.  .  billion people don't have access to electricity  refrigeration or stored fuels. This is a problem. It impacts  the spread of disease  the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life. So here's the plan  inexpensive refrigeration that doesn't use electricity  propane  gas  kerosene or consumables. Time for some thermodynamics. And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator. Adam Grosser  So    years ago  I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration. It's one of those things that stuck in my head. It was a lot like the Stirling engine  it was cool  but you didn't know what to do with it. And it was invented in       by this guy Ferdinand Carre  but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time. This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in       and it was a really neat idea  and I'll get to why it didn't work  but here's how it works. There's two spheres and they're separated in distance. One has a working fluid  water and ammonia  and the other is a condenser. You heat up one side  the hot side. The ammonia evaporates and it re condenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature  and then  as the ammonia re evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side  it creates a powerful cooling effect. So  it was a great idea that didn't work at all  it blew up. Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong. It topped     psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an interesting thought. So  the great thing about      is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do. So  we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved    a lot of computational fluid dynamics. We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong. We found some non toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures. Brought in a team from the U.K.    there's a lot of great refrigeration people  it turned out  in the U.K.    and built a test rig  and proved that  in fact  we could make a low pressure  non toxic refrigerator. So  this is the way it works. You put it on a cooking fire. Most people have cooking fires in the world  whether it's camel dung or wood. It heats up for about    minutes  cools for an hour. Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for    hours. It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype. It's not quite done. Weighs about eight pounds  and this is the way it works. You put it into a    liter vessel  about three gallons  and it'll cool it down to just above freezing    three degrees above freezing    for    hours in a    degree C environment. It's really cheap. We think we can build these in high volumes for about    dollars  in low volumes for about    dollars. And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. Thank you. Once upon a time  there was a dread disease that afflicted children. And in fact  among all the diseases that existed in this land  it was the worst. It killed the most children. And along came a brilliant inventor  a scientist  who came up with a partial cure for that disease. And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died  but it was certainly better than what they had before. And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free  virtually free  and was very easy to use. But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children  on infants  and on one year olds. And so  as a consequence  a few years later  another scientist    perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him  but building on the invention of the first one    came up with a second cure. And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one year olds. And the problem with this cure was it was very expensive  and it was very complicated to use. And although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly  almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end. But what they did  of course  since it was so complicated and expensive  they only used it on the zero year olds and the one year olds. And they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up. And this went on for quite some time. People were happy. They had their two cures. Until a particular mother  whose child had just turned two  died of this disease. And she thought to herself   My child just turned two  and until the child turned two  I had always used this complicated  expensive cure  you know  this treatment. And then the child turned two  and I started using the cheap and easy treatment  and I wonder     and she wondered  like all parents who lose children wonder     if there isn't something that I could have done  like keep on using that complicated  expensive cure.  And she told all the other people  and she said   How could it possibly be that something that's cheap and simple works as well as something that's complicated and expensive   And the people thought   You know  you're right. It probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution.  And the government  they heard her story and the other people  and they said   Yeah  you're right  we should make a law. We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children.  And the people were happy. They were satisfied. For many years this went along  and everything was fine. But then along came a lowly economist  who had children himself  and he used the expensive and complicated treatment. But he knew about the cheap and simple one. And he thought about it  and the expensive one didn't seem that great to him. So he thought   I don't know anything about science  but I do know something about data  so maybe I should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one.  And lo and behold  when he went through the data  he found that it didn't look like the expensive  complicated solution was any better than the cheap one  at least for the children who were two and older    the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger. And so  he went forth to the people and he said   I've made this wonderful finding  it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution  and by doing so we could save ourselves     million dollars a year  and we could spend that on our children in other ways.  And the parents were very unhappy  and they said   This is a terrible thing  because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing   And the government was very upset. And in particular  the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought   How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free  We would lose all of our market.  And people were very angry  and they called him horrible names. And he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days  and seek out some more intelligent  open minded people in a place called Oxford  and come and try and tell the story at that place. And so  anyway  here I am. It's not a fairy tale. It's a true story about the United States today  and the disease I'm referring to is actually motor vehicle accidents for children. And the free cure is adult seatbelts  and the expensive cure    the     million dollar a year cure    is child car seats. And what I'd like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why I believe this to be true  that for children two years old and up  there really is no real benefit    proven benefit    of car seats  in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why    what is it that makes that true  And then  finally talk a little bit about a third way  about another technology  which is probably better than anything we have  but which    there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution. OK. So  many times when you try to do research on data  it records complicated stories    it's hard to find in the data. It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats. So the United States keeps a data set of every fatal accident that's happened since     . So in every car crash in which at least one person dies  they have information on all of the people. So if you look at that data    it's right up on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's website    you can just look at the raw data  and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up. So  here is the data. Here I have  among two  to six year olds    anyone above six  basically no one uses car seats  so you can't compare      .  percent of the children who are unrestrained in a crash in which at least one person dies  themselves die. If you put a child in a car seat    .  percent of the children die. If they're wearing a lap and shoulder belt  in this raw data    .  percent die. And interestingly  wearing a lap only seatbelt    .  percent die. And actually  the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt's got to be worse than the lap and shoulder belt. And that just reminds you that when you deal with raw data  there are hundreds of confounding variables that may be getting in the way. So what we do in the study is    and this is just presenting the same information  but turned into a figure to make it easier. So the yellow bar represents car seats  the orange bar lap and shoulder  and the red bar lap only seatbelts. And this is all relative to unrestrained    the bigger the bar  the better. Okay. So  this is the data I just showed  OK  So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat. So you can control for the basic things  like how hard the crash was  what seat the child was sitting in  etc.  the age of the child. And that's that middle set of bars. And so  you can see that the lap only seatbelts start to look worse once you do that. And then finally  the last set of bars  which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash              different characteristics of the crash. And what you find is that the car seats and the lap and shoulder belts  when it comes to saving lives  fatalities look exactly identical. And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well. And it's not just overall. It's very robust to anything you want to look at. One thing that's interesting  if you look at frontal impact crashes    when the car crashes  the front hits into something    indeed  what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better. And I think this isn't just chance. In order to have the car seat approved  you need to pass certain federal standards  all of which involve slamming your car into a direct frontal crash. But when you look at other types of crashes  like rear impact crashes  indeed  the car seats don't perform as well. And I think that's because they've been optimized to pass  as we always expect people to do  to optimize relative to bright line rules about how affected the car will be. And the other thing you might argue is   Well  car seats have got a lot better over time. And so if we look at recent crashes    the whole data set is almost    years' worth of data    you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far  far better.  But indeed  in recent crashes the lap and shoulder seatbelts  actually  are doing even better than the car seats. They say   Well  that's impossible  that can't be.  And the line of argument  if you ask parents  is   But car seats are so expensive and complicated  and they have this big tangle of latches  how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated   It's kind of an interesting logic  I think  that people use. And the other logic  they say   Well  the government wouldn't have told us  to  use them if they weren't much better.  But what's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much. It really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two  which has led to the passage of all these laws    not very much on data. So you can only get so far  I think  in telling your story by using these abstract statistics. And so I had some friends over to dinner  and I was asking    we had a cookout    I was asking them what advice they might have for me about proving my point. They said   Why don't you run some crash tests   And I said   That's a great idea.  So we actually tried to commission some crash tests. And it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country  none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said  some explicitly  some not so explicitly   All of our business comes from car seat manufacturers. We can't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats.  Now  eventually  one did. Under the conditions of anonymity  they said they would be happy to do this test for us    so anonymity  and       dollars per seat that we crashed. And so  we went to Buffalo  New York  and here is the precursor to it. These are the crash test dummies  waiting for their chance to take the center stage. And then  here's how the crash test works. Here  they don't actually crash the entire car  you know    it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it. So they just have these bench seats  and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it. So I just wanted you to look at this. And I think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great. Look at the kid in the car seat. Does he not look content  ready to go  like he could survive anything  And then  if you look at the kid in back  it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens. It's hard to believe  when you look at this  that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash. So this is going to be a crash where they're going to slam this thing forward into a wall at    miles an hour  and see what happens. OK  So  let me show you what happens. These are three year old dummies  by the way. So here    this is the car seat. Now watch two things  watch how the head goes forward  and basically hits the knees    and this is in the car seat    and watch how the car seat flies around  in the rebound  up in the air. The car seat's moving all over the place. Bear in mind there are two things about this. This is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed       car seats  who knew exactly how to do it. And also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way to install car seats. Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them. And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat  OK  So  that kid in this crash fared very well. The federal standards are that you have to score below a       to be an approved car seat on this crash  in some metric of units which are not important. And this crash would have been about a    . So this car seat was actually an above average car seat from Consumer Reports  and did quite well. So the next one. Now  this is the kid  same crash  who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all  actually  relative to the other child. The funny thing is  the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up to do the car seats  and so  they actually don't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that's on the rebound. Anyway  it turns out that those two crashes  that actually the three year old did slightly worse. So  he gets about a     out of    you know  on this range    relative to a     and something. But still  if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government  and said   I have invented a new car seat. I would like you to approve it for selling   then they would say   This is a fantastic new car seat  it works great. It only got a      it could have gotten as high up as a      .  And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat. So  in some sense  what this is suggesting is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong  which is putting children at risk. It's just that  fundamentally  the car seats aren't doing much. So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time  so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat    at rebound  it takes a lot longer    but there's just a lot less movement for child who's in the seatbelt. So  I'll show you the six year old crashes as well. The six year old is in a car seat  and it turns out that looks terrible  but that's great. That's like a      OK  So that kid would do fine in the crash. Nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all. And then here's the six year old in the seatbelt  and in fact  they get exactly within  you know  within one or two points of the same. So really  for the six year old  the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever. That's some more evidence  so in some sense    I was criticized by a scientist  who said   You could never publish a study with an n of     meaning those four crashes. So I wrote him back and I said   What about an n of          Because I had the other        other real world crashes. And I just think that it's interesting that the idea of using real world crashes  which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do  is something that scientists don't actually  usually think    they would rather use a laboratory  a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies  than actually    years of data of what we've seen with children and with car seats. And so I think the answer to this puzzle is that there's a much better solution out there  that's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working. And if you think from a design perspective  about going back to square one  and say   I just want to protect kids in the back seat.  I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say   Well  the right way to start would be  let's make a great seat belt for adults. And then  let's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain.  I mean  why not start    who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids  But essentially  do something like this  which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do  but there's no reason I could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat. It's just actually    you see  this is folding up    it's behind the seat. You've got a regular seat for adults  and then you fold it down  and the kid sits on top  and it's integrated. It seems to me that this can't be a very expensive solution  and it's got to work better than what we already have. So the question is  is there any hope for adoption of something like this  which would presumably save a lot of lives  And I think the answer  perhaps  lies in a story. The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful  and why this may someday be adopted or not  lies in a story that my dad told me  relating to when he was a doctor in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago  you were allowed to do things then you can't do today. So  my father would have patients come in who he thought were not really sick. And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them  and he'd say   Come back in a week  if you still feel lousy.  OK  and most of them would not come back  but some of them would come back. And when they came back  he  still convinced they were not sick  had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills. They were almost impossible to swallow. And these  to me  are the analogy for the car seats. People would look at these and say   Man  this thing is so big and so hard to swallow. If this doesn't make me feel better  you know  what possibly could   And it turned out that most people wouldn't come back  because it worked. But every once in a while  there was still a patient convinced that he was sick  and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills. And the jar of pills he had  he said  were the tiniest little pills he could find  so small you could barely see them. And he would say  listen  I know I gave you that huge pill  that complicated  hard to swallow pill before  but now I've got one that's so potent  that is really tiny and small and almost invisible. It's almost like this thing here  which you can't even see.  And it turned out that never  in all the times my dad gave out this pill  the really tiny pill  did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness. So  my dad always took that as evidence that this little  teeny  powerful pill had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense  if that's the right story  I think integrated car seats you will see  very quickly  becoming something that everyone has. The other possible conclusion is  well  maybe after coming to my father three times  getting sent home with placebos  he still felt sick  he went and found another doctor. And that's completely possible. And if that's the case  then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come. Thank you very much. we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life  it's also to prevent lots of serious injury. Your data looks at fatalities. It doesn't look at serious injury. Is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective  or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury  Because that would prove your case.  Steven Levitt  Yeah  that's a great question. In my data  and in another data set I've looked at for New Jersey crashes  I find very small differences in injury. So in this data  it's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts. In the New Jersey data  which is different  because it's not just fatal crashes  but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported  it turns out that there is a    percent difference in injuries  but generally they're the minor injuries. Now  what's interesting  I should say this as a disclaimer  there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data  which suggests that car seats are dramatically better. And they use a completely different methodology that involves    after the crash occurs  they get from the insurance companies the names of the people who were in the crash  and they call them on the phone  and they asked them what happened. And I really can't resolve  yet  and I'd like to work with these medical researchers to try to understand how there can be these differences  which are completely at odds with one another. But it's obviously a critical question. The question is even if    are there enough serious injuries to make these cost effective  It's kind of tricky. Even if they're right  it's not so clear that they're so cost effective. Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen who went down to Africa in the     s. They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes  and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester. And one of them wrote   Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes.  And the other one wrote   Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet.  Now  there's a similar situation in the classical music world  because there are some people who think that classical music is dying. And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet. And rather than go into statistics and trends  and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing  and the record companies that are folding  I thought we should do an experiment tonight. Actually  it's not really an experiment  because I know the outcome. But it's like an experiment. Now  before we start    Before we start  I need to do two things. One is I want to remind you of what a seven year old child sounds like when he plays the piano. Maybe you have this child at home. He sounds something like this. I see some of you recognize this child. Now  if he practices for a year and takes lessons  he's now eight and he sounds like this. He practices for another year and takes lessons    he's nine. Then he practices for another year and takes lessons    now he's   . At that point  they usually give up. Now  if you'd waited for one more year  you would have heard this. Now  what happened was not maybe what you thought  which is  he suddenly became passionate  engaged  involved  got a new teacher  he hit puberty  or whatever it is. What actually happened was the impulses were reduced. You see  the first time  he was playing with an impulse on every note. And the second  with an impulse every other note. You can see it by looking at my head. The nine year old put an impulse on every four notes. The    year old  on every eight notes. And the    year old  one impulse on the whole phrase. I don't know how we got into this position. I didn't say   I'm going to move my shoulder over  move my body.  No  the music pushed me over  which is why I call it one buttock playing. It can be the other buttock. You know  a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing  when I was working with a young pianist. He was the president of a corporation in Ohio. I was working with this young pianist  and said   The trouble with you is you're a two buttock player. You should be a one buttock player.  I moved his body while he was playing. And suddenly  the music took off. It took flight. The audience gasped when they heard the difference. Then I got a letter from this gentleman. He said   I was so moved. I went back and I transformed my entire company into a one buttock company.  Now  the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you. There are       people  I believe. My estimation is that probably    of you are absolutely passionate about classical music. You adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial. You have CDs in your car  and you go to the symphony  your children are playing instruments. You can't imagine your life without classical music. That's the first group  quite small. Then there's another bigger group. The people who don't mind classical music. You know  you've come home from a long day  and you take a glass of wine  and you put your feet up. A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm. That's the second group. Now comes the third group  people who never listen to classical music. It's just simply not part of your life. You might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport ...    and maybe a little bit of a march from  Aida  when you come into the hall. But otherwise  you never hear it. That's probably the largest group. And then there's a very small group. These are the people who think they're tone deaf. Amazing number of people think they're tone deaf. Actually  I hear a lot   My husband is tone deaf.  Actually  you cannot be tone deaf. Nobody is tone deaf. If you were tone deaf  you couldn't change the gears on your car  in a stick shift car. You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome. And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone  she calls and says   Hello   you not only know who it is  you know what mood she's in. You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear. So nobody is tone deaf. But I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing  with such a wide gulf between those who understand  love and are passionate about classical music  and those who have no relationship to it at all. The tone deaf people  they're no longer here. But even between those three categories  it's too wide a gulf. So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room  downstairs and in Aspen  and everybody else looking  will come to love and understand classical music. So that's what we're going to do. Now  you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work  if you look at my face  right  It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading to realize whatever he's dreaming. Imagine if Martin Luther King had said   I have a dream. Of course  I'm not sure they'll be up to it.  All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin. This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin. Some of you will know it. Do you know what I think probably happened here  When I started  you thought   How beautiful that sounds.   I don't think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year.  It's funny  isn't it  It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head. And of course    Of course  if the piece is long and you've had a long day  you might actually drift off. Then your companion will dig you in the ribs and say   Wake up  It's culture   And then you feel even worse. But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you  but because of us  Did anybody think while I was playing   Why is he using so many impulses   If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it. And for the rest of your life  every time you hear classical music  you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses. So let's see what's really going on here. We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C. And the job of the C is to make the B sad. And it does  doesn't it  Composers know that. If they want sad music  they just play those two notes. But basically  it's just a B  with four sads. Now  it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F. So we have B  A  G  F. And if we have B  A  G  F  what do we expect next  That might have been a fluke. Let's try it again. Oh  the TED choir. And you notice nobody is tone deaf  right  Nobody is. You know  every village in Bangladesh and every hamlet in China    everybody knows  da  da  da  da    da. Everybody knows  who's expecting that E. Chopin didn't want to reach the E there  because what will have happened  It will be over  like Hamlet. Do you remember  Act One  scene three  he finds out his uncle killed his father. He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him. And then he backs away  he goes up to him again  almost kills him. The critics sitting in the back row there  they have to have an opinion  so they say   Hamlet is a procrastinator.  Or they say   Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.  No  otherwise the play would be over  stupid. That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet    Ophelia going mad  the play within the play  and Yorick's skull  and the gravediggers. That's in order to delay    until Act Five  he can kill him. It's the same with the Chopin. He's just about to reach the E  and he says   Oops  better go back up and do it again.  So he does it again. Now  he gets excited. That's excitement  don't worry about it. Now  he gets to F sharp  and finally he goes down to E  but it's the wrong chord    because the chord he's looking for is this one  and instead he does ... Now  we call that a deceptive cadence  because it deceives us. I tell my students   If you have a deceptive cadence  raise your eyebrows  and everybody will know.  Right. He gets to E  but it's the wrong chord. Now  he tries E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work. Now  he tries E again  and that doesn't work. And then finally ... There was a gentleman in the front row who went   Mmm.  It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home after a long day  turns off the key in his car and says   Aah  I'm home.  Because we all know where home is. So this is a piece which goes from away to home. I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow. B  C  B  C  B  C  B    down to A  down to G  down to F. Almost goes to E  but otherwise the play would be over. He goes back up to B  he gets very excited. Goes to F sharp. Goes to E. It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord. And finally goes to E  and it's home. And what you're going to see is one buttock playing. Because for me  to join the B to the E  I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way  and start thinking about the long  long line from B to E. You know  we were just in South Africa  and you can't go to South Africa without thinking of Mandela in jail for    years. What was he thinking about  Lunch  No  he was thinking about the vision for South Africa and for human beings. This is about vision. This is about the long line. Like the bird who flies over the field and doesn't care about the fences underneath  all right  So now  you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E. And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through. Would you think of somebody who you adore  who's no longer there  A beloved grandmother  a lover    somebody in your life who you love with all your heart  but that person is no longer with you. Bring that person into your mind  and at the same time  follow the line all the way from B to E  and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say. Now  you may be wondering    You may be wondering why I'm clapping. Well  I did this at a school in Boston with about    seventh graders     year olds. I did exactly what I did with you  and I explained the whole thing. At the end  they went crazy  clapping. I was clapping. They were clapping. Finally  I said   Why am I clapping   And one of them said   Because we were listening.  Think of it.       people  busy people  involved in all sorts of different things  listening  understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin. Now  that is something. Am I sure that every single person followed that  understood it  was moved by it  Of course  I can't be sure. But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland during the Troubles     years ago  and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on conflict resolution. And I did this with them    a risky thing to do  because they were street kids. And one of them came to me the next morning and he said   You know  I've never listened to classical music in my life  but when you played that shopping piece ...  He said   My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him. But last night  when you played that piece  he was the one I was thinking about. And I felt the tears streaming down my face. And it felt really good to cry for my brother.  So I made up my mind at that moment that classical music is for everybody. Everybody. Now  how would you walk    my profession  the music profession doesn't see it that way. They say three percent of the population likes classical music. If only we could move it to four percent  our problems would be over. How would you walk  How would you talk  How would you be  If you thought   Three percent of the population likes classical music  if only we could move it to four percent.  How would you walk or talk  How would you be  If you thought   Everybody loves classical music    they just haven't found out about it yet.  See  these are totally different worlds. Now  I had an amazing experience. I was    years old  I'd been conducting for    years  and I suddenly had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound. My picture appears on the front of the CD    But the conductor doesn't make a sound. He depends  for his power  on his ability to make other people powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life changing. People in my orchestra said   Ben  what happened   That's what happened. I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of course  I wanted to know whether I was doing that. How do you find out  You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. You could light up a village with this guy's eyes. Right. So if the eyes are shining  you know you're doing it. If the eyes are not shining  you get to ask a question. And this is the question  who am I being that my players' eyes are not shining  We can do that with our children  too. Who am I being  that my children's eyes are not shining  That's a totally different world. Now  we're all about to end this magical  on the mountain week  we're going back into the world. And I say  it's appropriate for us to ask the question  who are we being as we go back out into the world  And you know  I have a definition of success. For me  it's very simple. It's not about wealth and fame and power. It's about how many shining eyes I have around me. So now  I have one last thought  which is that it really makes a difference what we say    the words that come out of our mouth. I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz  one of the rare survivors. She went to Auschwitz when she was    years old. And ... And her brother was eight  and the parents were lost. And she told me this  she said   We were in the train going to Auschwitz  and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing. I said  'Why are you so stupid  can't you keep your things together for goodness' sake '  The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother. Unfortunately  it was the last thing she ever said to him  because she never saw him again. He did not survive. And so when she came out of Auschwitz  she made a vow. She told me this. She said   I walked out of Auschwitz into life and I made a vow. And the vow was   I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say.  Now  can we do that  No. And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong. But it is a possibility to live into. Thank you. Shining eyes. Shining eyes. Thank you  thank you. Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country    I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor. And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. My family was wealthy  and my father believed in one thing  and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted. And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris. And he was a clever man. He sort of said   Well  that's OK  but you've done very well in your math SATs.  In fact  I'd got an    . And he thought I did very well    and I did  too    in the arts  this was my passion. And he said  If you go to MIT   to which I had been given early admission   I will pay for every year you're at MIT  in graduate or undergraduate    as much as you want    I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.  And I thought that was the best deal in town  so I accepted it immediately. And I decided that if I was good in art  and I was good in mathematics  I'd study architecture  which was the blending of the two. I went and told my headmaster that  at prep school. And I said to him what I was doing  that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together. He said to me something that just went completely over my head. He said   You know  I like grey suits  and I like pin striped suits  but I don't like grey pin striped suits.  And I thought   What a turkey this guy is   and I went off to MIT. I studied architecture  then did a second degree in architecture  and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. That really  the mixing of art and science was computers  and that that really was the place to bring both  and enjoyed a career doing that. And probably  if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale  I'd put     percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. And after doing this for a long time  and the Media Lab passing the baton on  I thought   Well  maybe it's time for me to do a project. Something that would be important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.  And in the case of the Media Lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing people who were either executives or wealthy  and also not having  in my own case  a career to worry about anymore. My career  I mean  I'd done my career. Didn't have to worry about earning money. Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me. And I said   Boy  let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features   and thought that if we could address education  by leveraging the children  and bringing to the world the access of the computers  that that was really the thing we should do. Never shown this picture before  and probably going to be sued for it. It's taken at three o'clock in the morning  without the permission of the company. It's about two weeks old. There they are  folks. If you look at the picture  you'll see they're stacked up. Those are conveyor belts that go around. This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by  but then you'll see the ones up above. What happens is  they burn into flash memory the software  and then test them for a few hours. But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line  because it's constant. So they go around in this loop  which is why you see them up there. So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back. This picture was taken in       just before the IBM PC was even announced. Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. And when people tell me   Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids   I say to myself   What planet do you come from   Okay  there's not a person in this room    I don't care how techie you are    there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK  We all need help  even those of us who are very seasoned. This picture of Seymour       years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in       and then basically presented it in         April    to be precise    called  Teaching Children Thinking.  What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug the programs  they come the closest to learning about learning. That was very important  and in some sense  we've lost that. Kids don't program enough and boy  if there's anything I hope this brings back  it's programming to kids. It's really important. Using applications is OK  but programming is absolutely fundamental. This is being launched with three languages in it  Squeak  Logo  and a third  that I've never even seen before. The point being  this is going to be very  very intensive on the programming side. This photograph is very important because it's much later. This is in the early     s. My son  Dimitri    who's here  many of you know Dimitri    went to Cambodia  set up this school that we had built  just as the school connected it to the Internet. And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this  plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child. This is the same village in Cambodia  just a couple of months ago. These kids are real pros. There were just       machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit  but they were all wrong. And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold. There are many reasons  but the two that merit the little bit of time is  one  the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear. I can see any head of state  any executive I want  at any time  because I'm not selling laptops. OK  I have no shareholders. Whether we sell  it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive    you can get the best people in the world. If you look at our professional services  including search firms  including communications  including legal services  including banking  they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money. We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people. You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they're the best people. We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary  and we had a queue of people. It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important  and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar. And while this machine in some sense is silly  in retrospect  it actually served a very important purpose. That pencil yellow crank was remembered by everybody. Everybody remembered the pencil yellow crank. It's different. It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike. Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank    it really is stupid to have it on board  by the way. In spite of what some people in the press don't get it  didn't understand it  we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do    having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want. You want a separate thing  like the AC adaptor. I didn't bring one with me  but they really work much better off board. And then  I could tell you lots about the laptop  but I decided on just four things. Just keep in mind    because there are other people  including Bill Gates  who said   Gee  you've got a real computer.  That computer is unlike anything you've had  and does things    there are four of them    that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power  and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body. Dual mode display    that sunlight display's fantastic. We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight  and the more sunlight the better. And that was really critical. The mesh network  it'll become commonplace. And of course   rugged  goes without saying. And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. And by the way  when I graduated from MIT  I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  Laughter  So  I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design  cheap labor  cheap components  and making a cheap laptop. And  in English  the word  cheap  has a double meaning  which is really appropriate  because it's cheap  in the pejorative sense  as well as inexpensive. But if you take a different approach  and you think of very large scale integration  very advanced materials  very advanced manufacturing    so you're pouring chemicals in one end  iPods are spewing out the other    and really cool design  that's what we wanted to do. And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes. These are his slides  and so I don't have to talk about them. But it was really  to us  very important as a strategy. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute  because somebody    you know  good design is very important. Yves showed one of the power generating devices. The mesh network  the reason I    and I won't go into it in great detail    but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world  they're connected. There's not just laptops. And so  we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators. It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other. If you're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart. If you're in the jungle  it's about     meters. So if a kid bicycles home  or walks a few miles  they're going to be off the grid  so to speak. They're not going to be near another laptop  so you have to nail these onto a tree  and sort of  get it. You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. And that's very important  the user interface. We are launching with    keyboards. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare  too. You just look at some of the languages. I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. Is there anybody in the room  one person  unless you work with OLPC  is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen  There's only one hand    so you get it. Yes  you're right. He's right. It's Amharic  it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia  there's never been a keyboard. There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. And this is the big difference. Again  when you're a nonprofit  you look at children as a mission  not as a market. So we went to Ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard. And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard. So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out. And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning    it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning  it's not what we're doing now    is to go to six countries. Big countries  one of them is not so big  but it's rich. Here's the six. We went to the six  and in each case the head of state said he would do it  he'd do a million. In the case of Gaddafi  he'd do  .  million  and that they would launch it. We thought  this is exactly the right strategy  get it out  and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. And so I went to each of those countries at least six times  met with the head of state probably two or three times. In each case  got the ministers  went through a lot of the stuff. This was a period in my life where I was traveling     days per year. Not something you'd envy or want to do. In the case of Libya  it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. The camel smells were unbelievable. And it was    degrees C. I mean  this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries    I say former  because none of them really came through this summer    there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity  make a press release. So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay  bless their hearts. Small country  not so rich. President said he'd do it  and guess what  He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us  nothing specific about sunlight readable  mesh network  low power  but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what  We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay  the first          boom  went to OLPC. The next day    the next day  not even    hours had passed    in Peru  the president of Peru said   We'll do    .  And boom  a little domino effect. The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. The president of Ethiopia said he would do it. And boom  boom  boom. The president of Mongolia. And so what happens is  these things start to happen with these countries    still not enough. Add up all those countries  it didn't quite get to thing  so we said   Let's start a program in the United States.  So  end of August  early September  we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle  end    just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. We thought that was a good time to announce it. Launched it on the    of November. We said it would be just for a short period until the   . We've extended it until the   . And the  Give One  Get One  program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. The first day it was just wild. And then we said   Well  let's get people to give many. Not just one  and get one  but maybe give      give      .  And that's where you come in. And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy     dollars worth of laptops. Okay  Do it  but that's not going to help. Okay  If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for     dollars  whatever it is      people in the room doing it    yeah  great. I want you do something else. And it's not to go out and buy     or        though  I invite you to do that  and        would be even better. Tell people about it  It's got to become viral  OK  Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists. Get your friends to give one  get one. And if each one of you sends it to     or     people  that would be fantastic. I won't dwell on the pricing at all. Just to say that when you do the  Give One  Get One   a lot of press is a bit about   They didn't make it  it's     dollars  it's not    .  It will be     in two years. It will go below    . We've pledged not to add features  but to bring that price down. But it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do    I've just said it. Don't just give one  get one. I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even    hours old  or maybe it's    hours. The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship  and I'm talking now about              at a time went out this week. They went to Uruguay  Peru  Mexico. And it's been slow coming  and we're only making about       a week  but we hope  we hope  sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year  to hit a million a month. Now put that number  and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number. We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year. But a million a month in laptop land is a big number. And the world production today  everybody combined  making laptops  is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year  we're going to make    percent of the world production. And if we do that  there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. And we hope if you have EG two years from now  or whenever you have it again  I won't have bad breath  and I will be invited back  and will have  hopefully by then  maybe     million out there to children. Thank you. Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier. So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity  it was incredible. And I want to tell you that story. I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics. It's a competition we're holding  the second X PRIZE  for the first team to sequence     human genomes in    days. We have something called the Genome            individuals we're sequencing as part of that. Craig Venter chairs that event. And I met Professor Hawking  and he said his dream was to travel into space. And I said   I can't take you there  but I can take you into weightlessness into zero g. And he said  on the spot   Absolutely  yes.  Well  the only way to experience zero g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight  weightless flight. You take an airplane  you fly over the top  you're weightless for    seconds. Come back down  you weigh twice as much. You do it again and again. You can get eight     minutes of weightlessness    how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long. We set out to do this. It took us    years to become operational. And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking. We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say  you're crazy  don't do that  you're going kill the guy. And he wanted to go. We worked hard to get all the permissions. And six months later  we sat down at Kennedy Space Center. We had a press conference  we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola  give him    seconds of zero g. And if it went really well  we might do three parabolas. Well  we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this. And what he said  for me  was very moving. He said   Life on Earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ... I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space.  We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center  up inside the NASA vehicle  into the back of the zero g airplane. We had about    people who made donations    we raised          in donations for children's charities    who flew with us. A few TEDsters here. We set up a whole ER. We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane. We were monitoring his PO  of his blood  his heart rate  his blood pressure. We had everything all set in case of an emergency  God knows  you don't want to hurt this world renowned expert. We took off from the shuttle landing facility  where the shuttle takes off and lands. And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero g. Once he was there   we  let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like. And after that first parabola  you know  the doc said everything is great. He was smiling  and we said go. So we did a second parabola. And a third. We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did. And we did a fourth  and a fifth and a sixth. And a seventh and an eighth. And this man does not look like a    year old wheelchair bound man. He was so happy. We are living on a precious jewel  and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet. Please join us in this epic adventure. Thank you so much. Some of you have heard the story before  but  in fact  there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story    in front of an audience    before  so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story. I used to be a photographer for many years. In       I was working for Time magazine  and I was given a three day assignment to photograph Amerasian children  children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia  and then abandoned           children all over Asia. I had never heard the word Amerasian before. I spent a few days photographing children in different countries  and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists  I always hope that when my pictures were published  they might actually have an effect on a situation  instead of just documenting it. So  I was so disturbed by what I saw  and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards  that I decided I would take six months off. I was    years old. I decided I would find six children in different countries  and actually go spend some time with the kids  and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time magazine. In the course of doing the story  I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before  and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids. And a man told me  who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea  that there was a young girl  who was    years old  being raised by her grandmother. And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her. Every time any Westerners came to the village  she hid the girl. And of course  I was immediately intrigued. I saw photographs of her  and I thought I wanted to go. And the guy just told me   There's no way. This grandmother won't even    you know  there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising.  I took a translator with me  and went to this village  found the grandmother  sat down with her. And to my astonishment  she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter. And I was paying for this myself  so I asked the translator if it would be OK if I stayed for the week. I had a sleeping bag. The family had a small shed on the side of the house  so I said   Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings   And I just told the little girl  whose name was Hyun Sook Lee  that if I ever did anything to embarrass her    she didn't speak a word of English  although she looked very American    she could just put up her hand and say   Stop   and I would stop taking pictures. And then  my translator left. So there I was  I couldn't speak a word of Korean  and this is the first night I met Hyun Sook. Her mother was still alive. Her mother was not raising her  her grandmother was raising her. And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were. The grandmother was incredibly fond  deeply in love with this little girl. They slept on the floor at night. The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors  so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor. Hyun Sook was    years old. I had photographed  as I said  a lot of these kids. Hyun Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph. And almost universally  amongst all the kids  they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of  ridiculed  picked on and been rejected. And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids. And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun Sook was how confident she appeared to be  how happy she seemed to be in her own skin. And remember this picture  because I'm going to show you another picture later  but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother  although she looks so Western. I decided to follow her to school. This is the first morning I stayed with her. This is on the way to school. This is the morning assembly outside her school. And I noticed that she was clowning around. When the teachers would ask questions  she'd be the first person to raise her hand. Again  not at all shy or withdrawn  or anything like the other children that I'd photographed. Again  the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions. Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears in the middle of class. And one of the other things that I said to her through the translator    again  this thing about saying stop    was to not pay attention to me. And so  she really just completely ignored me most of the time. I noticed that at recess  she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team. It was very obvious  from the very beginning  that she was a leader. This is on the way home. And that's North Korea up along the hill. This is up along the DMZ. They would actually cover the windows every night  so that light couldn't be seen  because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time. So there's always this    the closer you were to North Korea  the more terrifying it was. Very often at school  I'd be taking pictures  and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears  and then look at me and say   Stop.  And I would stand at attention  and all the girls would crack up  and it was sort of a little joke. The end of the week came and my translator came back  because I'd asked her to come back  so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun Sook. And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator  the grandmother started crying. And I said to my translator   What's going on  why is she crying   And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment  and then she started getting tears in her eyes. And I said   OK  what did I do  What's going on  Why is everyone crying   And the translator said   The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying  and she wants to know if you would take Hyun Sook to America with you.  And I said   I'm    years old  and I live in hotels  and I'm not married.  I mean I had fallen in love with this girl  but I    you know  it was  like  emotionally I was about    years old. If you know of photographers  the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.  Sorry  I have to go on an assignment  I'll be back     and then you never come back. So  I asked the translator why she thought she was dying. Can I get her to a hospital  Could I pay to get her a doctor  And she refused any help at all. And so  when I got outside  I actually gave the translator some money and said   Please go back and see if you can do something.  And I gave the grandmother my business card. And I said   If you're serious  I will try to find a family for her.  And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta  Georgia  who had an    year old son. And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child. So here my friends Gene and Gail had not heard from me in about a year  and suddenly I was calling  saying  I'm in Korea  and I've met this extraordinary girl.  And I said   The grandmother thinks she's sick  but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also.  And I said   I'll pay for the ...   I mean  I had this whole sort of picture. So anyway  I left. And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her. And I said   Look  I think I'll scare the grandmother to death  if I actually write to her and tell her that you're willing to adopt her  I want to go back and talk to her.  But I was off on assignment. I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother. And on Christmas Day  I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram    back in those days  you got telegrams    from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died  and left their child in a will to me. Did I know anything about this  Because I hadn't told them what I was doing  because I was so upset with the story they'd run. So  I went back to Korea  and I went back to Hyun Sook's village  and she was gone. And the house that I had spent time in was empty. It was incredibly cold. No one in the village would tell me where Hyun Sook was  because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners. And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me. So I finally found Myung Sung  her best friend that she used to play with after school every day. And Myung Sung  under some pressure from me and the translator  gave us an address on the outside of Seoul. And I went to that address and knocked on the door  and a man answered the door. It was not a very nice area of Seoul  as there were mud streets outside of it. And I knocked on the door  and Hyun Sook answered the door  and her eyes were bloodshot  and she seemed to be in shock. She didn't recognize me    there was no recognition whatsoever. And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean. And I said to the translator   What did he say   And she said   He wants to know who you are.  And I said   Well  tell him that I am a photographer.  I started explaining who I was  and he interrupted. And she said   He says he knows who you are  what do you want   I said   Well  tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her.  And he said   I'm her uncle  she's fine  you can leave now.  So I was    you know  the door was being slammed in my face  it's incredibly cold  and I'm trying to think   What would the hero do in a movie  if I was writing this as a movie script   So I said   Listen  it's really cold  I've come a very long way  do you mind if I just come in for a minute  I'm freezing.  So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor. And as we started talking  I saw him yell something  and Hyun Sook came and brought us some food. And I had this whole mental picture of  sort of like Cinderella. I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful  bright  happy little child  who now appeared to be very withdrawn  being enslaved by this family. And I was really appalled  and I couldn't figure out what to do. And the more I tried talking to him  the less friendly he was getting. So I finally decided  I said  Look      this is all through the translator  because  this is all  you know  I don't speak a word of Korean    and I said   Look  I'm really glad that Hyun Sook has a family to live with. I was very worried about her. I made a promise to her grandmother  your mother  that I would find a family  and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her.  I said   But you know  I bought an airline ticket  and I'm stuck here for a week.  And I said   I'm staying in a hotel downtown. Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow  And you can practice your English.  Because he told me    I was trying to ask him questions about himself. And so I went to the hotel  and I found two older Amerasians. A girl whose mother had been a prostitute  and she was a prostitute  and a boy who'd been in and out of jail. And I said to them   Look  there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America.  I said   I don't know if it's the right decision or not  but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street  what people say to you  what you do for a living. And just    I want him to understand what happens if she stays here. And I could be wrong  I don't know  but I wish you would come tomorrow.  So  these two came to lunch  and we got thrown out of the restaurant. They were yelling at him  they were    it got to be really ugly. And we went outside  and he was just furious. And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing. Here I was again  trying to figure out what to do. And he started yelling at me  and I said to the translator   OK  tell him to calm down  what is he saying   And she said   Well  he's saying  'Who the hell are you to walk into my house  some rich American with your cameras around your neck  accusing me of enslaving my niece  This is my niece  I love her  she's my sister's daughter. Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this '  And I said  you know   Look   I said   You're absolutely right. I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.  I said   All I know is  I've been photographing a lot of these children.  I said   I'm in love with your niece  I think she's an incredibly special child.  And I said   Look  I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them  to see if you approve of them. I just think that    what little I know about the situation  she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have.  So  everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was  again  the stupidest thing I could have possibly done  because who's ever good enough for your relative  But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother. And they actually take items of clothing and photographs  and they burn them as part of the ritual. And you can see how different she looks just in three months. This was now  I think  February  early February. And the pictures before were taken in September. Well  there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story  who had    children living in his house. He had three women helping him take care of these kids. And so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keene  to find out how the adoption process worked. Because I wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board. So  this is on the way down to the orphanage. This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy. He had kids from all over Korea living there  and he would find families for these kids. This is a social worker interviewing Hyun Sook. Now  I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this  because the grandmother  to me  appeared to be sort of the village wise woman  and the person everybody    throughout the day  I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother. And I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village  they were one of the most respected families in the village. And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded  and insisted  that the villagers treat Hyun Sook with the same respect they treated her. Hyun Sook stayed at Father Keene's  and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through. He actually agreed to the adoption. And I went off on assignment and came back a week later  and Father Keene said   I've got to talk to you about Hyun Sook.  I kind of said   Oh God  now what   And he takes me into this room  and he closes the door  and he says   I have    children here in the orphanage  and it's total bedlam.  And there's clothes  and there's kids  and  you know  there's three adults and    kids    you can imagine. And he said   The second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids. And she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids. And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day.  And he said   She's telling me that I'm messy  and I have to clean up my room.  And he said   I don't know who raised her  but   he said   she's running the orphanage  and she's been here three days.  This was movie day    that she organized    where all the kids went to the movies. A lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids  telling them about what their life was like with their new families. So  it was a really big deal when the letters showed up. This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage  whose son had been adopted. Gene and Gail started studying Korean the moment they had gotten my first letter. They really wanted to be able to welcome Hyun Sook into their family. And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips    Hyun Sook had chosen the name Natasha  which I understood was from her watching a  Rocky and Bullwinkle  cartoon on the American Air Force station. This may be one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up here  in a minute. So  my friend Gene flew over with his son  Tim. Gail couldn't come. And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary. And this was Gene showing the uncle where Atlanta was on the map  where he lived. This is the uncle signing the adoption papers. Now  we went out to dinner that night to celebrate. The uncle went back to his family  and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner. And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork  and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons. We went back to our hotel room  and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was. This is the third night we were in Korea. The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us. Now  I'd been staying in this room for about three months    it was a little    story Korean hotel. So  the second night  we didn't keep the kids' room  because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage. And the third night  we came back  we'd just gone out to dinner  where you saw the pictures  and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said   There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight  so if you want to put the kids five floors below you  there's a room there.  And Gene and I looked at each other and said   No  we don't want two    year olds five floors away.  So  his son said   Dad  I have a sleeping bag  I'll sleep on the floor.  And I said   Yeah  I have one too.  So  Tim and I slept on the floor  Natasha got one bed  Gene got the other    kids pass out  it's been very exciting for three days. We're lying in bed  and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are. We said   That was so great  we saved this little girl's life.  We were just like  you know  ah  just full of ourselves. And we fall asleep    and I've been in this room  you know  for a couple of months now. And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly  so during the day I always left the window open. And then  at night  about midnight  they turn the heat off in the hotel. So at about   a.m.  the whole room would be like    below zero  and I'd get up. I'd been doing this every night I'd been there. So  sure enough  it's one o'clock  room's freezing  I go to close the window  and I hear people shouting outside  and I thought   Oh  the bars must have just gotten out.  And I don't speak Korean  but I'm hearing these voices  and I'm not hearing anger  I'm hearing terror. So  I open the window  and I look out  and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel  and the hotel's on fire. So  I run over to Gene  and I wake him up  and I say   Gene  don't freak out  I think the hotel's on fire.  And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows    we're on the eleventh floor. So  the two of us were just like   Oh my God  oh my God.  So  we're trying to get Natasha up  and we can't talk to her. And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour  it's like they took five Valiums    you know  they're all over the place. And we can't talk to her. I remember his son had the L.L. Bean bootlaces  and we're trying to do up his laces. So  we try to get to the door  and we run to the door  and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace. There's people screaming  there's the sound of glass breaking  there's these weird thumps. And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds. And Gene turns around and says   We're not going to make it.  And he closes the door  and the whole room is now filled with smoke. We're all choking  and there's smoke pouring through the vents  under the doors. There's people screaming. I just remember this unbelievable  just utter chaos. I remember sitting near the bed  and I was just so    I had two overwhelming feelings. One was absolute terror    it's like   Oh  please God  I just want to wake up. This has got to be a nightmare  this can't be happening. Please  I just want to wake up  it's got to be a nightmare.  And the other is unbelievable guilt. Here I've been  playing God with my friends' lives  my friends' son  with Natasha's life  and this what you get when you try playing God  is you hurt people. I remember just being so frightened and terrified. And Gene  who's lying on the floor  says   Man  we've got to soak towels.  I said   What   He says   We've got to soak towels. We're going to die from the smoke.  So  we ran to the bathroom  and got towels  and put them over our faces  and the kids faces. Then he said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   What   He said   Do you have gaffer's tape   I said   Yeah  somewhere in my Halliburton.  He says   We've got to stop the smoke.  He said   That's all we can do  we've got to stop the smoke.  I mean  Gene    thank God for Gene. So  we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall  we put blankets at the bottom of the door  we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air. And there was a building  a new building  going up  that was being built right outside  across the street from our hotel. And there  in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump. Eleven people ended up dying in the fire. Five people jumped and died  other people were killed by the smoke. And there's this loud thumping on the door after about    minutes in all this  and people were shouting in Korean. And I remember  Natasha didn't want us opening the door    sorry  I was trying not to open the door  because we'd spent so much time barricading the room. I didn't know who it was  I didn't know what they wanted  and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out. I remember a sort of a tussle at the door  trying to get the door open. In any case     hours later  I mean  they put us in the lobby. Gene ended up using his coat  and his fist in the coat  to break open a liquor cabinet. People were lying on the floor. It was one of just the most horrifying nights. And then    hours later  we rented a car  as we had planned to  and drove back to Natasha's village. And we kept saying   Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire  like eight hours ago   It's so weird how life just goes on. Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers  and the day we showed up turned out to be a    year old man's birthday. This guy's    years old. So it turned into a dual celebration  because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States. So  these are the greenhouse tents. This is the elders teaching Gene their dances. We drank a lot of rice wine. We were both so drunk  I couldn't believe it. This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back. The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through. Like  what could you do for a year  So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side  and I photographed them  and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done. And four months later  the adoption papers came through. This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage. This is Father Keene with Natasha at the bus stop. Her great aunt at the airport. I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years  where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography. It was like the ultimate perk. And the pilot  I actually knew    because they used to let me sit in the jump seat  to tell you how long ago this was. This is a Tri Star  and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat. And the pilot  Jeff Cowley  actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha. This is    hours later in Atlanta. It's a very long flight. Just to make things even crazier  Gail  Natasha's new mom  was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter. So you know  if you were writing this  you'd say   No  we've got to write the script differently.  This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts. Gene and Gail know everyone in Atlanta    they're the most social couple imaginable. So  at this point  Natasha doesn't speak a word of English  other than what little Father Keene taught her. This is Kylie  her sister  who's now a doctor  on the right. This is a deal I had with Natasha  which is that when we got to Atlanta she could take    she could cut off my beard. She never liked it very much. She learned English in three months. She entered seventh grade at her own age level. Pledge of Allegiance for the first time. This is her cooking teacher. Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up  because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer  and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well  in the beginning. But what I noticed  again as an observer  was she was choosing who was going to be on her team  and seemed to be very popular very  very quickly. Now  remember the picture  how much she looked like her grandmother  at the beginning  People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother  Gail. This is a tense moment in the first football game  I think. And Kylie    I mean  it was almost like Kylie was her own child. She's being baptized. Now  a lot of parents  when they adopt  actually want to erase their children's history. And Gail and Gene did the complete opposite. They were studying Korean  they bought Korean clothes. Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen  which was that   Once upon a time  there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta.  She hates this picture    it was her first job. She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia with the money she made working at Burger King. The captain of the cheerleaders. Beauty pageant. Used to do their Christmas card every year. Gene's been restoring this car for a million years. Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea. Her future husband  Jeff  was working for Canon cameras  and met Natasha at the Olympic Village. This is her first trip back to Korea  so there's her uncle. This is her half sister. She went back to the village. That's her best friend's mother. And I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit. It's just  you know  it was just so interesting  just to watch    this is her mother in the background there. This is Natasha's wedding day. Gene is looking a little older. This is Sydney  who's going to be three years old in a couple of days. And there's Evan. Natasha  would you just come up  for a second  just maybe to say hello to everybody  Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story. I mean  she    you know  we've looked at the pictures together. Natasha  I've seen pictures millions of times  but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation. I started crying. Rick Smolan  I'm sure there's about    things she's going to tell me   That wasn't what happened  that wasn't what you said.  Natasha  Later  I'll do that later. RS  Anyway  thank you  Mike and Richard  so much for letting us tell the story. Thank you all of you.   Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else      nobody anywhere.     A moment ago  there were voices and faces to look upon      you can't see them anywhere.     Nothing more to say     and no one left to say it to  anyway.     Oh  listen to what I say.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth.     Children are everywhere.     Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth.     Wondering why you should care  yeah.     Nothing more to say     and only love can see us through  anyway.     Oh  listen what I say  yeah.     Everybody can be somebody     and everybody is free to make a difference.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference.     You don't have to be a big celebrity     to feel the power  the power in your soul  no.     You don't have to be a big star on MTV     to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see.     Everybody can be somebody.     Everybody is free to make a difference in this world.     You can make a little difference in this world.     I can make a little difference in this world.     She can make a little difference in this world.     He can make a little difference in this world.     You can  I can  she can  he can      we can make a little bit of difference in this world.     Everybody gonna make a little     little difference  yeah.     Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference.     Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world      oh yeah.   Thank you so much. This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on  and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record  which I still stand by  but this has got something else in it. It's called  Peace on Earth.    There is no hope.     There is no future.     No faith in God to save the day.     There is no reason  no understanding     no sacred place to hide away.     There is no earnest conversation.     No words of wisdom from the wise.     There is no reconciliation     and no collective compromise.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more.     There is no darkness  no sunshine.     There is no great society.     There is no freedom without conviction.     There is no freedom to be free.     There is no heaven  no fire and brimstone.     There is no brotherhood of man.     There is no country  no one religion.     There is no universal plan.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     Yet  there in the hallway     lurks the ghost of war.     He wants more  and more  and more  and more      and more  and more  and more  and more  and more.     The answer is     mutual assured destruction      a balance of power      a weapon for everyone.     Mutual assured destruction     bringing peace to everyone.     Peace on Earth      that's what we want.     Peace on Earth      that's what we all say.     Peace on Earth.     There in the hallway      peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.     Peace on Earth.   I don't speak English. I start speaking English  learning English  about a year ago. I speak French and I grew up with French  so my English is Franglais. I'm born in the Western Congo  in an area around here  and then went to university in Kisangani. And after I finished  I went to this area  the Ituri Forest. But what I've been doing    when I was about     I grew in my uncle's house. And my father was a soldier  and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher. What I've been doing from    to    was  I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk  meat and whatever they were killing  poaching  hunting in the forest  bring it in the main city to get access to the market. But finally  I got myself involved. Around    to    years  I became  myself  a poacher. And I wanted to do it  because    I believed    to continue my studies. I wanted to go to university  but my father was poor  my uncle even. So  I did it. And for three to four years  I went to university. For three times  I applied to biomedical science  to be a doctor. I didn't succeed. I was having my inscriptions  my admission to biology. And I said   No way  I'm not doing it. My family's poor  my area don't have better health care. I want to be a doctor to serve them.  Three times  that means three years  and I start getting old. I say   Oh  no  I continue.  So  I did tropical ecology and plant botany. When I finished  I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship. It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing right up to now    I'm standing in front of you    doing botany and wildlife conservation. That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants. And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also. So  the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number    I think that is the largest number of elephants we have right now in protected areas in Congo. It has also chimpanzees. And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature. That is a forest giraffe. I think you guys know it quite well. Here we have savanna giraffes  but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in Congo. It has also some beautiful primates. Thirteen species    highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa. And it has the Ituri Forest itself    about       species of plants  so far known. I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society  working there  in       but I started working with them as a student in     . I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor. But I didn't like the way    the instruction I got was very poor. And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center. With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko  that most of you know  life became very  very difficult. And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it. When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo  so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated. So they started fleeing from the east to the west. And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there  so there was a road from Goma  somewhere here  and coming like this. So they might go through  pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve. Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area  and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them. So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve. On their way  they looted everything. Torture  wars    oh  my God  you can't believe. Every person was looking his way    where to go  we don't know. And it was for us  the young  the first time really we hear the language of war  of guns. And even people who faced the rebellion of       after our independence  they didn't believe what was happening. They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want because they have power. Who have been doing that  Young children. Child soldiers. You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns. But I was from the west  working in the east. I even  at  that time was not speaking Swahili. And when they came  they looted everything. You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu  and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier. And I was from the same area to him. All my friends said  we are leaving because we are a target. But I'm not going to the east  because I don't know Swahili. I stay. If I go  I will be killed. I can't go back to my area    it's more than       kilometers  away . I stayed after they looted everything. We have been doing research on botany  and we have a small herbarium of       sheets of plants. We cut  we dry and we packed them  we mounted them on a folder. Purpose  so that we start them for agriculture  for medicine  for whatever  and for science  for the study of the flora and the change of the forest. That is people moving around  that's even Pygmies. And this is a bright guy  hard working person  and Pygmy. I've been working with him about    years. And with soldiers  they went to the forest for poaching elephants. Because he's Pygmy  he knows how to track elephants in the forest. He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest. They came to told me  I have to save him. And what I did  I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis. And fortunately  I saved his life. And that was the language of the war. Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral  killing animals  the logging timbers and so on. And what of important things    I think all of you here have a cell phone. That mineral has killed a lot  five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo Tantalite    they call it Coltan    that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area  all over in Congo. Extraction  and good  big business of the war. And what I did for the first war  after we have lost everything  I have to save something  even myself  my life and life of the staff. I buried some of our new vehicle engines  I buried it to save it. And some of equipment went with them  on the top of the canopy  to save it. He's not collecting plants  he's going to save our equipment on the canopy. And with the material that's left    because they wanted to destroy it  to burn it  they didn't understand it  they didn't go to school    I packed it. And that is me  going to  hurrying to Uganda  to try to save that       material  with people carrying them on the bikes  bicycles. And after that  we succeeded. I housed that       material at the herbarium of Makerere University. And after the war  I have been able to bring it back home  so that we continue our studies. The second war came while we didn't expect it. With friends  we had been sitting and watching match football  and having some good music with WorldSpace radio  when it started  I think. So  it was so bad. We heard that now from the east again the war started  and it's going fast. This time I think Kabila will go in place of  as he did with Mobutu. And the reserve was a target to the rebels. Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources. And there was no way to work. They destroy everything. Poaching    oh  no way. And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them. What's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks  And they can't do what they are doing. So we went to meet them. That is Coltan extraction  gold mining. So  we started talking with them  convincing them that we are in a protected area. There are regulations that it's prohibited to do logging  mining and poaching  specifically. But they said   You guys  you think that soldiers who are dying are not important  and your animals you are protecting are most important. We don't think so. We have to do it  because to let our movement advance.  I say   No way  you are not going to do it here.  We started talking with them and I was negotiating. Tried to protect our equipment  tried to protect our staff and the villages of about       people. And we continued. But I was doing that  negotiating with them. Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean Pierre Bemba  with Mbusa Nyamwisi  with Kabila  and I'm there. Sometimes  they talk to my own language  that is  Lingala. I hear it and what strategy they are doing  what they are planning. Sometimes  they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on. They used me to carry that  and I was doing counting  what comes from where  and where  and where. I had only this equipment    my satellite phone  my computer and a plastic solar panel    that I hide it in the forest. And every time  daily  after we have meeting  what compromise we have  whatever  I go  I write a short email  send it. I don't know how many people I had on my address. I sent the message  what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do. They started suspecting that what we do on the morning  and the afternoon  it's on the news  BBC  RFI. Something might be going on. And one day  we went for a meeting. Sorry. One day  we went to meet the Chief Commander. He had the same iridium cell phone like me. And he asked me   Do you know how to use this   I said   I have never seen it. I don't know.  And I had mine on my pocket. So  it was a chance that they trusted me a lot. They didn't    they was not looking on me. So I was scared. And when we finished the meeting  I went to return it in the forest. And I was sending news  doing whatever  reporting daily to the U.N.  to UNESCO  to our institution in New York  what have been going. And for that  they have been having big pressure to leave  to free the area. Because there was no way    whatever they do  it's known the same time. During the first two rebellions  they killed all animals in the zoo. We have a zoo of    Okapis  and one of them was pregnant. And during the war  after a week of heavy war  fighting in the area  we succeeded  we had the first Okapi. This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this. This is not local population  this is rebels. They are now happy sending the news that they have protected the Okapi with the war  because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere. After a week  we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi  they killed an elephant  just    meters to the area where the zoo  where Okapi was born. And I was mad. I oppose it    that they are now going to dissect it  until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander. And I succeeded. The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks. What we are doing after that    that was the situation of the war    we have to rebuild. I had some money. I was paid     dollars. I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium  because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants. Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants. I started this with    dollars  and start fundraising money to where I've been going. I had opportunity to go all over  where herbarium for my African material is. And they supported me a bit  and I built this. Now  it's doing work to train young Congolese. And also  what one of the speciality we are doing  my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity  and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon. This is one of the studies we are doing on a    hectare plot  where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters  and we are tracking them. We have now data of about    years  to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions. And that is    I think it's difficult for me. This is a very embarrassing talk  I know. I don't know where to start  where to finish it. When I was thinking to come here  what best title I wanted to say to my talk  I didn't find this. But now I think that I would have titled it   The Language of Guns.  Where are you people  Now we are talking about reconstitution  rebuild Africa. But is gun industries a tool to rebuild  or is it a game  I think we see the war like a game    like soccer  football. Everybody is happy  but see what it's doing  see what is going in Darfur. Now we say  oh  my God. See what the wars in Rwanda. That's because of the language of guns. I don't think that someone may blame Google  because it's doing the right things  even if people like Al Qaeda are using Google to connect between them. But it's serving millions for the best. But what is doing with gun industries  Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you  thank you. Just wait over there. It's an amazing story. I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have. How can we help you  Corneille Ewango  That's really embarrassing questions. I think that now I feel nervous. And I think  helping us  people are acting sometimes by ignorance. I did it myself. If I know when I was young  that  by  killing an elephant  I'm destroying biodiversity  I would not have done it. Many  many of you have seen the talents of Africans  but there are few who are going to school. Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics  HIV  malaria  poverty  not going to school. What you can assist us  it's by building capacities. How many have got opportunity like me to go to U.S.  do a master's  And go    now  I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D. But many of them are just here  because they don't have money. And they can't go even to university. They can't even attain the bachelor's degree. Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa. CA  Thank you  thank you. I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now  that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made. That technology is simulating humans. It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body. Now  before I talk more about that technology  let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games. This is a clip from a game called  Grand Theft Auto  .  We already saw that briefly yesterday. And what you can see is    it is actually a very good game. It's one of the most successful games of all time. But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive. They pretty much look the same. I've made him run into a wall here  over and over again. And you can see he looks always the same. The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters. They are a graphical visualization of a character. To produce these animations  an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game  and then has to animate that particular sequence. So  he or she sits down  animates it  and tries to anticipate what's going to happen  and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game. Now  the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity. All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times. It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be  because you only get out of it  at least in terms of the character  what you actually put into it. There's no real emergence there. And thirdly  as I said  most of the animations are very repetitive because of that. Now  the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body. And maybe  if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is    because  I mean  it's very  very trivial. If I push Chris a bit  like this  for example  he'll react to it. If I push him from a different angle  he'll react to it differently  and that's because he has a physical body  and because he has the motor skills to control that body. It's a very trivial thing. It's not something you get in computer games at the moment  at all. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  That's it  Torsten Reil  That's it  yes. So  that's what we're trying to simulate    not Chris specifically  I should say  but humans in general. Now  we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University  and we tried to start very simply. What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk. That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen. So  it's subject to gravity  has joints  etc. If you just run the simulation  it will just collapse  like this. The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work. And for that  we use the neural network  which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans. It's called the central pattern generator. So  we simulated that as well  and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk. For that we used artificial evolution    genetic algorithms. We heard about those already yesterday  and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already. But  just briefly  the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals    neural networks  in this case    all of which are random at the beginning. You hook these up    in this case  to the virtual muscles of that two legged creature here    and hope that it does something interesting. At the beginning  they're all going to be very boring. Most of them won't move at all  but some of them might make a tiny step. Those are then selected by the algorithm  reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well. And you repeat that process over and over again  until you have something that walks    in this case  in a straight line  like this. So that was the idea behind this. When we started this  I set up the simulation one evening. It took about three to four hours to run the simulation. I got up the next morning  went to the computer and looked at the results  and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line  like I've just demonstrated  and this is what I got instead. So  it was back to the drawing board for us. We did get it to work eventually  after tweaking a bit here and there. And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run. So  what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution. At the beginning  it can't walk at all  but it will get better and better over time. So  this is the one that can't walk at all. Now  after five generations of applying evolutionary process  the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better. Generation    and it'll take a few steps more    still not quite there. But now  after generation     it actually walks in a straight line without falling over. That was the real breakthrough for us. It was  academically  quite a challenging project  and once we had reached that stage  we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach    actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it. Now  at this stage  it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds. What you see here is the character standing there  and there's an obstacle that we put in its way. And what you see is  it's going to fall over the obstacle. Now  the interesting bit is  if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right  which is what I'm doing now  here  it will fall over it in a completely different way. And again  if you move the obstacle a tiny bit  it'll again fall differently. Now  what you see  by the way  at the top there  are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles. Okay. That's the video. Thanks. Now  this might look kind of trivial  but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds. Now  at this stage  we decided to start a company and move this further  because obviously this was just a very simple  blocky biped. What we really wanted was a full human body. So we started the company. We hired a team of physicists  software engineers and biologists to work on this  and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body  basically. It's got to be relatively fast  so you can run it on a normal machine  but it's got to be accurate enough  so it looks good enough  basically. So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing  and tried to make it as realistic as possible. What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body. I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair  clothes  etc.  but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization  so you can concentrate on the movement. Now  what I'm going to do right now  in a moment  is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens. Nothing really interesting  basically. It falls over  but it falls over like a rag doll  basically. The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it. It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it. So  this character now has motor skills in the upper body    nothing in the legs yet  in this particular one. But what it will do    I'm going to push it again. It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed. It's going to stick out its hands. It's going to turn around into the fall  and try and catch the fall. So that's what you see here. Now  it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well. So here  we've got the same character. I'm going to push it a bit harder now  harder than I just pushed Chris. But what you'll see is    it's going to receive a push now from the left. What you see is it takes steps backwards  it tries to counter balance  it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land. I'll show you this again. And then  finally hits the floor. Now  this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions  again  just as I've done. That's something that you cannot do right now. At the moment  you only have empty computer graphics in games. What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now. So  here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you  but now I'm just going to push it from different directions. First  starting with a push from the right. This is all slow motion  by the way  so we can see what's going on. Now  the angle will have changed a tiny bit  so you can see that the reaction is different. Again  a push  now this time from the front. And you see it falls differently. And now from the left    and it falls differently. That was really exciting for us to see that. That was the first time we've seen that. This is the first time the public sees this as well  because we have been in stealth mode. I haven't shown this to anybody yet. Now  just a fun thing  what happens if you put that character    this is now a wooden version of it  but it's got the same AI in it    but if you put that character on a slippery surface  like ice. We just did that for a laugh  just to see what happens. And this is what happens. It's nothing we had to do about this. We just took this character that I just talked about  put it on a slippery surface  and this is what you get out of it. And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach. Now  when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology  we got a very good response. And what they said was  the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen. Because stunts are obviously very dangerous  they're very expensive  and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do  obviously  because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt. So  they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months. And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks. So  here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked. That's what people want. That's what we're giving them. You can see  it's always reacting. This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically  in this particular case  feels the force and tries to protect its head. Only  I think it's quite a big blow again. You feel kind of sorry for that thing  and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more. There are much worse videos than this  by the way  which I have taken out  but ... Now  here's another one. What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion  a strong force applied to the character  and have the character react to it in midair. So that you don't have a character that looks limp  but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away  that looks kind of alive in midair as well. So this character is going to be hit by a force  it's going to realize it's in the air  and it's going to try and  well  stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing. That's one angle  here's another angle. We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films. And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization. This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London  who are using our software and experimenting with it right now. So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw  but in a slightly better rendered version. So if you look at the character carefully  you see there are lots of body movements going on  none of which you have to animate like in the old days. Animators had to actually animate them. This is all happening automatically in the simulation. This is a slightly different angle  and again a slow motion version of this. This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time. You can run this simulation in real time  in front of your eyes  change it  if you want to  and you get the animation straight out of it. At the moment  doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days. This is another behavior they requested. I'm not quite sure why  but we've done it anyway. It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach. In this case  the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space  and all we've told the character to do is to struggle. And it looks organic. It looks realistic. You feel kind of sorry for the guy. It's even worse    and that is another video I just got last night    if you render that a bit more realistically. Now  I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel  how realistic it can look. And this is all a physical simulation of the body  using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body. Now  one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene  and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee. Got a very short clip here. Yes  you can just about see it here. In this case  they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt. It was just voted  I think in the Sunday Times  as one of the most impressive stunts. Now  we've just tried and    looked at our character and asked ourselves   Can we do that ourselves as well   Can we use the physical simulation of the character  use artificial intelligence  put that artificial intelligence into the character  drive virtual muscles  simulate the way he jumps off the dam  and then skydive afterwards  and have him caught by a bungee afterwards  We did that. It took about altogether just two hours  pretty much  to create the simulation. And that's what it looks like  here. Now  this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages  and we pretty much just did this for a laugh  just to see what we'd get out of it. But what we found over the past few months is that this approach    that we're pretty much standard upon    is incredibly powerful. We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations. There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before. There's so many things we can do with this right now. The first thing  as I said  is going to be virtual stuntmen. Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen  and they're going to hit the screen quite soon  actually  for some major productions. The second thing is video games. With this technology  video games will look different and they will feel very different. For the first time  you'll have actors that really feel very interactive  that have real bodies that really react. I think that's going to be incredibly exciting. Probably starting with sports games  which are going to become much more interactive. But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds  like there  for example  that Tom Melcher has shown us. The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different  I think  from what you're getting right now. A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation. We've been approached by several simulation companies  but one project we're particularly excited about  which we're starting next month  is to use our technology    and in particular  the walking technology    to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy  to predict the outcome of operations on these children. As you probably know  it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait. The classic quote is  I think  it's unpredictable at best  is what people think right now  is the outcome. Now  what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool. We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait  before he actually commits to an actual surgery. That's one project we're particularly excited about  and that's going to start next month. Just finally  this is only just the beginning. We can only do several behaviors right now. The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body. The body yes  but not all the motor skills that we have. And  I think  we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing. Right now  we don't have that but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage. We do have one unintentional dancer actually  the last thing I'm going to show you. This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved    half evolved  I should say    to produce balance  basically. So  you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter balance. That's what we thought was going to come out of this. But this is what emerged out of it  in the end. Bizarrely  this thing doesn't have a head. I'm not quite sure why. So  this was not something we actually put in there. He just started to create that dance himself. He's actually a better dancer than I am  I have to say. And what you see after a while    I think he even goes into a climax right at the end. And I think    there you go. So  that all happened automatically. We didn't put that in there. That's just the simulation creating this itself  basically. So it's just    Thanks. Not quite John Travolta yet  but we're working on that as well  so thanks very much for your time. Thanks. CA  Incredible. That was really incredible. TR  Thanks. I had a fire nine days ago. My archive      films  my    millimeter negative  all my books  my dad's books  my photographs. I'd collected    I was a collector  major  big time. It's gone. I just looked at it  and I didn't know what to do. I mean  this was    was I my things  I always live in the present    I love the present. I cherish the future. And I was taught some strange thing as a kid  like  you've got to make something good out of something bad. You've got to make something good out of something bad. This was bad  Man  I was    I cough. I was sick. That's my camera lens. The first one    the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with    years ago. That's my feature film.  King  Murray  won Cannes Film Festival         the only print I had. That's my papers. That was in minutes       minutes. Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.  You've got to make something good out of something bad   I started to say to my friends  neighbors  my sister. By the way  that's  Sputnik.  I ran it last year.  Sputnik  was downtown  the negative. It wasn't touched. These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film  which opens in New York in two weeks downtown. I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said   Come dig.  That's me at my desk. That was a desk took    some years to build. You know    all the stuff. That's my daughter  Jean. She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.  Dig it up   I said.  Pieces. I want pieces. Bits and pieces.  I came up with this idea  a life of bits and pieces  which I'm just starting to work on    my next project. That's my sister. She took care of pictures  because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot. And those are some of the pictures that    something was good about the burnt pictures. I didn't know. I looked at that    I said   Wow  is that better than the     That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television. It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it. Idea about women. So I started to say   Hey  man  you are too much  You could cry about this.  I really didn't. I just instead said   I'm going to make something out of it  and maybe next year ...   And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who've already given me so much solace  and just say to TEDsters  I'm proud of me. That I take something bad  I turn it  and I'm going to make something good out of this  all these pieces. That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved. I was a big record collector    the records didn't make it. Boy  I tell you  film burns. Film burns. I mean  this was    millimeter safety film. The negatives are gone. That's my father's letter to me  telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was   . That's my daughter and me. She's still there. She's there this morning  actually. That's my house. My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley. That's my wife  Heidi  who didn't take it as well as I did. My children  Davey and Henry. My son  Davey  in the hotel two nights ago. So  my message to you folks  from my three minutes  is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED. I came to live it  and I am living it. That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz  in Bonny Doon  just    miles from here. Thank you everybody. How do groups get anything done  Right  How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value  instead of just being chaos  And the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs. And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output. And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs  which is  if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people  you start an institution  right  You raise some resources. You found something. It can be private or public. It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small. But you get these resources together. You found an institution  and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group. More recently  because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor    and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination    there has been a second answer  which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure  to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system  without regard to institutional models. So  that's what I want to talk about today. I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples  but always pointing to the broader themes. So  I'm going to start by trying to answer a question that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other  and which the Internet is purpose built to answer  which is  where can I get a picture of a roller skating mermaid  So  in New York City  on the first Saturday of every summer  Coney Island  our local  charmingly run down amusement park  hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade  people come from all over the city  people get all dressed up. Some people get less dressed up. Young and old  dancing in the streets. Colorful characters  and a good time is had by all. And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself  charming though it is  but rather to these photos. I didn't take them. How did I get them  And the answer is  I got them from Flickr. Flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos  upload them  share them over the Web and so forth. Recently  Flickr has added an additional function called tagging. Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter. Delicious is a social bookmarking service. Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification. Right  If I had given this talk last year  I couldn't do what I just did  because I couldn't have found those photos. But instead of saying  we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they're uploaded  Flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos. So  I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged  Mermaid Parade.  There were       photos taken by     photographers  all aggregated and then put under this nice  neat name  shown in reverse chronological order. And I was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow. Now  what hard problem is being solved here  And it's    in the most schematic possible view  it's a coordination problem  right  There are a large number of people on the Internet  a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade. How do we get those people together to contribute that work  The classic answer is to form an institution  right  To draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals. And I want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route. First of all  when you form an institution  you take on a management problem  right  No good just hiring employees  you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth. Secondly  you have to bring structure into place. Right  You have to have economic structure. You have to have legal structure. You have to have physical structure. And that creates additional costs. Third  forming an institution is inherently exclusionary. You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo. You can't hire everyone in a company  right  You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization. You have to exclude some people. And fourth  as a result of that exclusion  you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here. We've gone from people with photos to photographers. Right  We've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade  or whatever else they're sent out to photograph. When you build cooperation into the infrastructure  which is the Flickr answer  you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals  rather than moving the individuals to the problem. You arrange the coordination in the group  and by doing that you get the same outcome  without the institutional difficulties. You lose the institutional imperative. You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort  but you also shed the institutional cost  which gives you greater flexibility. What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination. And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems. Right. You'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone  and you stopped making plans. You just said   I'll call you when I get there.   Call me when you get off work.  Right  That is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning. Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups. To say instead of  we must make an advance plan  we must have a five year projection of where the Wikipedia is going to be  or whatever  you can just say  let's coordinate the group effort  and let's deal with it as we go  because we're now well enough coordinated that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do. So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber. These are photos on Flickr tagged  Iraq.  And everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here. There are more pictures. There are more photographers. It's taken over a wider geographic area. The photos are spread out over a longer period of time. And worst of all  that figure at the bottom  approximately ten photos per photographer  is a lie. It's mathematically true  but it doesn't really talk about anything important    because in these systems  the average isn't really what matters. What matters is this. This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq as taken by the     photographers who contributed the       photos. And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer. You can see here  over at the end  our most prolific photographer has taken around     photos  and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos. Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos. And by the time we get around here  we get ten or fewer photos  and then there's this long  flat tail. And by the time you get to the middle  you've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each. This is called a power law distribution. It appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like    this is often what you get. Right  The math behind the power law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever's being measured  relative to the person in the first position. So  we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos  and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did. So  the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter. But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long  flat tail. And curiously  in these systems  as they grow larger  the systems don't converge  they diverge more. In bigger systems  the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer  so the imbalance increases. You can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted. Here's how heavily  if you take the top    percent of photographers contributing to this system  they account for three quarters of the photos taken    just the top    percent most prolific photographers. If you go down to five percent  you're still accounting for    percent of the photos. If you go down to one percent  exclude    percent of the group effort  you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos. And because of this left weighting  the average is actually here  way to the left. And that sounds strange to our ears  but what ends up happening is that    percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount. That sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same  but they're not at all. This is the math underlying the       rule. Right  Whenever you hear anybody talking about the       rule  this is what's going on. Right     percent of the merchandise accounts for    percent of the revenue     percent of the users use    percent of the resources    this is the shape people are talking about when that happens. Institutions only have two tools  carrots and sticks. And the    percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone. The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame. The institutional model always pushes leftwards  treating these people as employees. The institutional response is  I can get    percent of the value for    percent of the hires    great  that's what I'll do. The cooperative infrastructure model says  why do you want to give up a quarter of the value  If your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value  re engineer the system. Don't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people. Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount. So the coordination response asks not  how are these people as employees  but rather  what is their contribution like  Right  We have over here Psycho Milt  a Flickr user  who has contributed one  and only one  photo titled  Iraq.  And here's the photo. Right. Labeled   Bad Day at Work.  Right  So the question is  do you want that photo  Yes or no. The question is not  is Psycho Milt a good employee  And the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle. When you're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions  when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want  that's an institution as enabler world. You can hire those people as employees  you can coordinate their work and you can get some output. But when you're down here  where the Psycho Milts of the world are adding one photo at a time  that's institution as obstacle. Institutions hate being told they're obstacles. One of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation. And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n. Right  So  when institutions are told they are obstacles  and that there are other ways of coordinating the value  they go through something a little bit like the Kubler Ross stages       of reaction  being told you have a fatal illness  denial  anger  bargaining  acceptance. Most of the cooperative systems we've seen haven't been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase. Many  many institutions are still in denial  but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining. There's a wonderful  small example going on right now. In France  a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool  right  because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue. You can follow this in the Guardian. It's actually quite entertaining. The bigger question is  what do you do about the value down here  Right  How do you capture that  And institutions  as I've said  are prevented from capturing that. Steve Ballmer  now CEO of Microsoft  was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago  and he said   Oh  this business of thousands of programmers contributing to Linux  this is a myth. We've looked at who's contributed to Linux  and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing.  Right  You can hear this distribution under that complaint. And you can see why  from Ballmer's point of view  that's a bad idea  right  We hired this programmer  he came in  he drank our Cokes and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea. Right  Bad hire. Right  The Psycho Milt question is  was it a good idea  What if it was a security patch  What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit  of which Windows has not some   but  several  Do you want that patch  right  The fact that a single programmer can  without having to move into a professional relation to an institution  improve Linux once and never be seen from again  should terrify Ballmer. Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks  but is part of cooperative systems of open source software  of file sharing  of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr  but there are actually stories about this from all over. Meetup  a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you. When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup  he thought it would be used for  you know  train spotters and cat fanciers    classic affinity groups. The inventors don't know what the invention is. Number one group on Meetup right now  most chapters in most cities with most members  most active  Stay at home moms. Right  In the suburbanized  dual income United States  stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local  small scale neighborhoods. So they're reinventing it  using these tools. Meetup is the platform  but the value here is in social infrastructure. If you want to know what technology is going to change the world  don't pay attention to    year old boys    pay attention to young mothers  because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn't materially make their lives better. This is so much more important than Xbox  but it's a lot less glitzy. I think this is a revolution. I think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged. And I use that word advisedly. It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium. It's a whole new way of doing things  which includes new downsides. In the United States right now  a woman named Judith Miller is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources    she's a reporter for the New York Times    her sources  in a very abstract and hard to follow case. And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws. The shield laws are our laws    pretty much a patchwork of state laws    that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source. This is happening  however  against the background of the rise of Web logging. Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization. It has de professionalized publishing. Want to publish globally anything you think today  It is a one button operation that you can do for free. That has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization. And so the shield law  as much as we want it    we want a professional class of truth tellers    it is becoming increasingly incoherent  because the institution is becoming incoherent. There are people in the States right now tying themselves into knots  trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists. And the answer to that question is  it doesn't matter  because that's not the right question. Journalism was an answer to an even more important question  which is  how will society be informed  How will they share ideas and opinions  And if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism  it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class. So as much as we want the shield laws  the background    the institution to which they were attached    is becoming incoherent. Here's another example. Pro ana  the pro ana groups. These are groups of teenage girls who have taken on Web logs  bulletin boards  other kinds of cooperative infrastructure  and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice. They post pictures of thin models  which they call  thinspiration.  They have little slogans  like  Salvation through Starvation.  They even have Lance Armstrong style bracelets  these red bracelets  which signify  in the small group  I am trying to maintain my eating disorder. They trade tips  like  if you feel like eating something  clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass. We're used to support groups being beneficial. We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial. But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral. A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group. Now  when the larger group is a bunch of drunks  and the small group wants to stay sober  then we think  that's a great support group. But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice  then we're horrified. What's happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that we're used to  came from the institutions that were framing them  and not from the infrastructure. Once the infrastructure becomes generically available  the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone  including people pursuing these kinds of goals. So  there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides. And of course  in the current environment  one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs  and taking advantage of these. This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the      attack. It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week. Now  this is the part of the talk where I tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this  but I'm running out of time  which is good  because I don't know. Right. As with the printing press  if it's really a revolution  it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B. It takes us from Point A to chaos. The printing press precipitated     years of chaos  moving from a world where the Catholic Church was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia  when we finally knew what the new unit was  the nation state. Now  I'm not predicting     years of chaos as a result of this.   .    years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage  and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives    like deciding in advance what's going to happen  or the profit motive    the more leverage they'll get. And institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure  and the more rigidly managed  and the more they rely on information monopolies  the greater the pressure is going to be. And that's going to happen one arena at a time  one institution at a time. The forces are general  but the results are going to be specific. And so the point here is not   This is wonderful   or  We're going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework.  It's going to be much more complicated than that. But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment. And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming  my argument is essentially  we might as well get good at it. Thank you very much. How will we be remembered in     years  I happen to live in a little town  Princeton  in New Jersey  which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history  the Battle of Princeton  which was  in fact  a very important battle. It was the first battle that George Washington won  in fact  and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence. It happened     years ago. It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton. The town was burned down  it was in the middle of winter  and it was a very  very severe winter. And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter from hunger and cold  but nobody remembers that. What they remember is  of course  the great triumph  that the Brits were beaten  and we won  and that the country was born. And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered. It's the child that's remembered. And that's what we're going through at this time. I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology  because I think I know very little about that    I'm not a biologist    so everything I know about it can be said in one minute. What I'm saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry  that what really turned computers into a great success  in the world as a whole  is toys. As soon as computers became toys  when kids could come home and play with them  then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech. There's a huge       there's a huge community of people in the world who are practical biologists  who are dog breeders  pigeon breeders  orchid breeders  rose breeders  people who handle biology with their hands  and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things  beautiful creatures  plants  animals  pets. These people will be empowered with biotech  and that will be an enormous positive step to acceptance of biotechnology. That will blow away a lot of the opposition. When people have this technology in their hands  you have a do it yourself biotech kit  grow your own    grow your dog  grow your own cat. Just buy the software  you design it. I won't say anymore  you can take it on from there. It's going to happen  and I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural  becomes part of the human condition  something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts. So  let's leave that aside. I want to talk about something quite different  which is what I know about  and that is astronomy. And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe. And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that  and that's what I'll talk about for    minutes  or whatever the time remains. The important fact is  that most of the real estate that's accessible to us    I'm not talking about the stars  I'm talking about the solar system  the stuff that's within reach for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes    most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun. If you look at the solar system  as we know it today  it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live. It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through    to the orbit of Jupiter. The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate  but not very large. And it's not very promising for life  since most of it consists of rock and metal  mostly rock. It's not only cold  but very dry. So the asteroids we don't have much hope for. There stand some interesting places a little further out  the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. Particularly  there's a place called Europa  which is    Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter  where we see a very level ice surface  which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean. So  we believe that on Europa there is  in fact  a deep ocean. And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore. Ocean    probably the most likely place for life to originate  just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa  to go down through the ice  find out who is swimming around in the ocean  whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters    whatever there may be that's exciting     or cephalopods. But that's hard to do. Unfortunately  the ice is thick. We don't know just how thick it is  probably miles thick  so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there    send down your submarine or whatever it is    and explore. That's something we don't yet know how to do. There are plans to do it  but it's hard. Go out a bit further  you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune  way out  far from the Sun  that's where the real estate really begins. You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which  in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud    these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly  they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system  but they are biologically very interesting indeed  because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals  which are just the right ones for developing life. So if life could be established out there  it would have all the essentials    chemistry and sunlight    everything that's needed. So  what I'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life  rather than on Mars  although Mars is  of course  also a very promising and interesting place. But we can look outside  very cheaply and in a simple fashion. And that's what I'm going to talk about. There is a    imagine that life originated on Europa  and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years. It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface  just as it did on the Earth. Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for   billion years  finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great    much greater freedom  and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean. And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy  but it happened. Now  if life had originated on Europa in the ocean  it could also have moved out onto the surface. There wouldn't have been any air there    it's a vacuum. It is out in the cold  but it still could have come. You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice  growing on the surface. What would they need in order to grow on the surface  They'd need  first of all  to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin. So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin. But better    what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight. The sunlight in Jupiter  on the satellites of Jupiter  is    times fainter than it is here  since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun. So they would have to have    these creatures  which I call sunflowers  which I imagine living on the surface of Europa  would have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight  so they could keep themselves warm on the surface. Otherwise  they would be at a temperature of minus      which is certainly not favorable for developing life  at least of the kind we know. But if they just simply could grow  like leaves  little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight  then they could keep warm on the surface. They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight and have roots going down into the ocean  life then could flourish much more. So  why not look  Of course  it's not very likely that there's life on the surface of Europa. None of these things is likely  but my  my philosophy is  look for what's detectable  not for what's probable. There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there. And I mean  the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole. This was    originally  when radio astronomy began  Mr. Jansky  at the Bell labs  detected radio waves coming from the sky. And the regular astronomers were scornful about this. They said   It's all right  you can detect radio waves from the Sun  but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint  and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away  so it certainly will not be detectable. So there's no point in looking.  And that  of course  that set back the progress of radio astronomy by about    years. Since there was nothing there  you might as well not look. Well  of course  as soon as anybody did look  which was after about    years  when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things radiating in the radio spectrum  much brighter than the Sun. So  the same thing could be true for this kind of life  which I'm talking about  on cold objects  that it could in fact be very abundant all over the universe  and it's not been detected just because we haven't taken the trouble to look. So  the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it. There is something called pit lamping. That's the phrase which I learned from my son George  who is there in the audience. You take    that's a Canadian expression. If you happen to want to hunt animals at night  you take a miner's lamp  which is a pit lamp. You strap it onto your forehead  so you can see the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So  if you go out at night  you shine a flashlight  the animals are bright. You see the red glow in their eyes  which is the reflection of the flashlight. And then  if you're one of these unsporting characters  you shoot the animals and take them home. And of course  that spoils the game for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime  so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand  it's legal  because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits  because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand. So  the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps  and shine the headlights  and anything that doesn't look like a sheep  you shoot. So I have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe. That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces    either on Europa  or further out  anywhere where you can live on a cold surface    those creatures must be provided with reflectors. In order to concentrate sunlight  they have to have lenses and mirrors    in order to keep themselves warm. And then  when you shine sunlight at them  the sunlight will be reflected back  just as it is in the eyes of an animal. So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings. And the further out you go in this  away from the Sun  the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually  this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away  because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background. So as you go further away from the Sun  this becomes more and more powerful. So  in fact  you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth. Why aren't we doing it  Simply because nobody thought of it yet. But I hope that we shall look  and with any    we probably won't find anything  none of these speculations may have any basis in fact. But still  it's a good chance. And of course  if it happens  it will transform our view of life altogether. Because it means that    the way life can live out there  it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet. It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another. We're having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck. Especially if you breathe air  it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B  because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air       you're dead       as soon as you're off the planet  unless you have a spaceship. But if you live in a vacuum  if you live on the surface of one of these objects  say  in the Kuiper Belt  this    an object like Pluto  or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto  and you happened    if you're living on the surface there  and you get knocked off the surface by a collision  then it doesn't change anything all that much. You still are on a piece of ice  you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another. And then if you run into another object  you can stay there and colonize the other object. So life will spread  then  from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt  it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then a great competition amongst species    Darwinian evolution    so there'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages for spreading out long  sort of kelp like forest of vegetation. I call these creatures sunflowers. They look like  maybe like sunflowers. They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun  and they will be able to spread out in space  because gravity on these objects is weak. So they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will  in fact  be quite easy for us to detect. So  I hope in the next    years  we'll find these creatures  and then  of course  our whole view of life in the universe will change. If we don't find them  then we can create them ourselves. That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening. We can    as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering  one of the things you can do with your take it home  do it yourself genetic engineering kit    is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite  a place like Europa  so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures. That would be a fun thing to do. In the long run  of course  it would also make it possible for us to move out there. What's going to happen in the end  it's not going to be just humans colonizing space  it's going to be life moving out from the Earth  moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life  of course  is going to be the universe. And if life is already there  it makes it much more exciting  in the short run. But in the long run  if there's no life there  we create it ourselves. We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today. So again  we have a big and wonderful future to look forward. Thank you. I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others  have put    people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner.    who were happily in love     who had just been dumped  and we're just starting our third experiment  studying people who report that they're still in love after    to    years of marriage. So  this is the short story of that research. In the jungles of Guatemala  in Tikal  stands a temple. It was built by the grandest Sun King  of the grandest city state  of the grandest civilization of the Americas  the Mayas. His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. He stood over six feet tall. He lived into his   s  and he was buried beneath this monument in     AD. And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife. So  he built a temple in her honor  facing his. And every spring and autumn  exactly at the equinox  the sun rises behind his temple  and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow. And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon  it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow. After       years  these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb. Around the world  people love. They sing for love  they dance for love  they compose poems and stories about love. They tell myths and legends about love. They pine for love  they live for love  they kill for love  and they die for love. As Walt Whitman once said  he said   Oh  I would stake all for you.  Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in     societies. They've never found a society that did not have it. But love isn't always a happy experience. In one study of college students  they asked a lot of questions about love  but the two that stood out to me the most were   Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved   And the second question was   Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you   And almost    percent of both men and women said yes to both. Almost nobody gets out of love alive. So  before I start telling you about the brain  I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth. There's other love poems that are  of course  just as good  but I don't think this one can be surpassed. It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in       and here it is. I've never had the opportunity to say it before.  Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you. Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you  consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain    where are you going with my love  I am told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here. My body is numb with grief. Remember what I said  my love. Goodbye  my love  goodbye.  Emily Dickinson once wrote   Parting is all we need to know of hell.  How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution  How many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute  Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth. So  several years ago  I decided to look into the brain and study this madness. Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized  so I'm only going to say a very little about it. We found activity in a tiny  little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells called the A   cells  cells that actually make dopamine  a natural stimulant  and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed  this part  the VTA  is part of the brain's reward system. It's way below your cognitive thinking process. It's below your emotions. It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain  associated with wanting  with motivation  with focus and with craving. In fact  the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine. But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high    at least you come down from cocaine. Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you. You lose your sense of self. You can't stop thinking about another human being. Somebody is camping in your head. As an eighth century Japanese poet said   My longing had no time when it ceases.  Wild is love. And the obsession can get worse when you've been rejected. So  right now  Lucy Brown and I  the neuroscientist on our project  are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. It was very difficult actually  putting these people in the machine  because they were in such bad shape. So anyway  we found activity in three brain regions. We found activity in the brain region  in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. What a bad deal. You know  when you've been dumped  the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being  and then go on with your life    but no  you just love them harder. As the poet Terence  the Roman poet once said  he said   The less my hope  the hotter my love.  And indeed  we now know why. Two thousand years later  we can explain this in the brain. That brain system    the reward system for wanting  for motivation  for craving  for focus    becomes more active when you can't get what you want. In this case  life's greatest prize  an appropriate mating partner. We found activity in other brain regions also    in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses. You know  you're lying there  you're looking at the picture  and you're in this machine  and you're calculating  you know  what went wrong. How  you know  what have I lost  As a matter of fact  Lucy and I have a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play  and there's two con artists in the play  and the woman is conning the man  and the man looks at the woman and says   Oh  you're a bad pony  I'm not going to bet on you.  And indeed  it's this part of the brain  the core of the nucleus accumbens  actually  that is becoming active as you're measuring your gains and losses. It's also the brain region that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses. Last but not least  we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual. No wonder people suffer around the world  and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love  not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love  but you're feeling deep attachment to this individual. Moreover  this brain circuit for reward is working  and you're feeling intense energy  intense focus  intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life's greatest prize. So  what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world  Foremost  I have come to think that romantic love is a drive  a basic mating drive. Not the sex drive    the sex drive gets you out there  looking for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time  conserve your mating energy  and start the mating process with this single individual. I think of all the poetry that I've read about romantic love  what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato  over       years ago. He said   The god of love lives in a state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst  it's almost impossible to stamp out.  I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction  a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well  and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly. And indeed  it has all of the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person  you obsessively think about them  you crave them  you distort reality  your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person. And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction  tolerance  you need to see them more  and more  and more  withdrawals  and last  relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's just getting over a terrible love affair. It's been about eight months  she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving along in her car the other day  and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man. And she    not only did the instant craving come back  but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry. So  one thing I would like the medical community  and the legal community  and even the college community  to see if they can understand  that indeed  romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth. I would also like to tell the world that animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along. Too old  too young  too scruffy  too stupid  and they won't do it. Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage    and you know  if you spend your entire life in a little box  you're not going to be as picky about who you have sex with    but I've looked in a hundred species  and everywhere in the wild  animals have favorites. As a matter of fact ethologists know this. There are over eight words for what they call  animal favoritism   selective proceptivity  mate choice  female choice  sexual choice. And indeed  there are now three academic articles in which they've looked at this attraction  which may only last for a second  but it's a definite attraction  and either this same brain region  this reward system  or the chemicals of that reward system are involved. In fact  I think animal attraction can be instant    you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant. And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call  love at first sight.  People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say   Hardly.  You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake  and then when you sit down and eat that cake  you can still feel that joy. And certainly  I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too  but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion  really  for all human life. As a matter of fact  in New York  I often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot. And in fact  sometimes I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate  when I think of how intense this brain system is. Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague  Art Aron    putting people who are reporting that they are still in love  in a long term relationship  into the functional MRI. We've put five people in so far  and indeed  we found exactly the same thing. They're not lying. The brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active     years later. There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love. The question that I'm working on right this minute    and I'm only going to say it for a second  and then end    is  why do you fall in love with one person  rather than another  I never would have even thought to think of this  but Match.com  the Internet dating site  came to me three years ago and asked me that question. And I said  I don't know. I know what happens in the brain  when you do become in love  but I don't know why you fall in love with one person rather than another. And so  I've spent the last three years on this. And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another  that psychologists can tell you. And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background  the same general level of intelligence  the same general level of good looks  the same religious values. Your childhood certainly plays a role  but nobody knows how. And that's about it  that's all they know. No  they've never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship. So  it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine  serotonin  estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site that I have created  called Chemistry.com  I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals  and I'm watching who chooses who to love. And  .  million people have taken the questionnaire in America. About         people have taken it in    other countries. I'm putting the data together now  and at some point    there will always be magic to love  but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background  your same general level of intelligence  your same general level of good looks  and you don't feel pulled towards all of them. I think there's biology to that. I think we're going to end up  in the next few years  to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another. So  I will close with this. These are my older people. Faulkner once said   The past is not dead  it's not even the past.  Indeed  we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain. And so  there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature  and this reminds me of it. These are two women. Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do. Women get intimacy from face to face talking. We swivel towards each other  we do what we call the  anchoring gaze  and we talk. This is intimacy to women. I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face  cajoling it  reprimanding it  educating it with words. Men tend to get intimacy from side by side doing. As soon as one guy looks up  the other guy will look away. I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that    sitting behind the bush  looking straight ahead  trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock. I think  for millions of years  men faced their enemies  they sat side by side with friends. So my final statement is  love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you. As a clergyman  you can imagine how out of place I feel. I feel like a fish out of water  or maybe an owl out of the air. I was preaching in San Jose some time ago  and my friend Mark Kvamme  who helped introduce me to this conference  brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me  or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such    it was an eye opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference  and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that  because he made that decision. But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia  coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said   I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.  And another man looked in my direction and said   Yes  there he is. He's on this elevator with us.  And this man looked me up and down for about    seconds  and he said   My  what an anticlimax   I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a    is an anticlimax  after all these tremendous talks that you've heard  and addresses  which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago  and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte  North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there  and he got up out of his seat two or three times  and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by  and everybody was upset with him. And finally  John Belk said   Do you know who's sitting here   And the man said   No  who   He said   It's Billy Graham  the preacher.  He said   You don't say   And he turned to me  and he said   Put her there   He said   Your sermons have certainly helped me.  And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people. I know that as you have been peering into the future  and as we've heard some of it here tonight  I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't  because I'm    years old. This is my eightieth year  and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment  in both legs  and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here  because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that  and some other problems that I won't talk about. But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation  the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne  and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet  philosopher  writer  soldier    with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today. But about two centuries before David  the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron  and  slowly  that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it  or to have any. But David changed all of that  and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron  and which archaeologists have found  that in present day Palestine  there are evidences of that generation. Now  instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones  Israel now had iron plows  and sickles  and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation  Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron  in some ways  had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve. There were many problems still left. And they're still with us  and you haven't solved them  and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention  The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from  How do we solve it  Over again and again in the Psalms  which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world  David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says   He restores my soul.  Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are  On one hand  we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology  as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea  three miles down  or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future. But on the other hand  something is wrong. Our battleships  our soldiers  are on a frontier now  almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now  what causes this  Why do we have these wars in every generation  and in every part of the world  And revolutions  We can't get along with other people  even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world  bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that  or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man  so that he doesn't lie and cheat  and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever  The Bible says the problem is within us  within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator  which we call God  and we need to have our souls restored  something only God can do. Jesus said   For out of the heart come evil thoughts  murders  sexual immorality  theft  false testimonies  slander.  The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man  but he said   It's in our hearts that the evil lies  and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.  Albert Einstein    I was just talking to someone  when I was speaking at Princeton  and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree  because he said nobody was qualified to give him one. But he made this statement. He said   It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.  And many of you  I'm sure  have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances  such as the Internet we've heard about tonight  and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology  horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness  and said   You can restore my soul.  You see  the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God  or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life  and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns  really  for God. I find  that  young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities  and I have many questions and answer periods  and whether it's Cambridge  or Harvard  or Oxford    I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four    no  it's about two months from now    to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions  where did I come from  Why am I here  Where am I going  What's life all about  Why am I here  Even if you have no religious belief  there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said   When you see everything that happens in the world of science  and in the working of the universe  you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.  I remember once  I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin  whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists  and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well  and I said   I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about   And he surprised me with the answer. He said   Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.  I was a little bit surprised  but that evening that's what we talked about  and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward  she said   You know  I'm an atheist  but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.  The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job  and he said   Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.  Yes  to be sure  science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm    in a few months  I'll be    years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this    to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do  three or four times a day  you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere  I'm ad libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight  I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget  which I do sometimes  I've got something I can turn to. But even here among us  most    in the most advanced society in the world  we have poverty. We have families that self destruct  friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer  It's an age old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said   The Lord is my shepherd.  The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person  and our    many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable  or whoever it is. The old stars  they come to life. And they're    they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable. I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress  last year. And we were meeting in that room  the statue room. About     of them were there. And I said   There's one thing that we have in common in this room  all of us together  whether Republican or Democrat  or whoever.  I said   We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.  And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote  he said  there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born  and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people  whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death. And yet  a few years earlier  death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God  never talked about God  didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said  as he came to die  he sat up on the side of the bed one day  and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said  for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable  and about God. Was there a God  A few years ago  a university student asked me   What is the greatest surprise in your life   And I said   The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.  But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun  in the aftermath of World War II concluded  quote   science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary  they're sisters.  He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said   Speaking for myself  I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.  He also said   In our search to know God  I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.  I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France  and in different parts of the world        countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer  who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany  since the war. And he once    and he said to me  he said   Young man.  He said   Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ   And I said   Sir  I do.  He said   So do I.  He said   When I leave office  I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again  and why it's so important to believe that.  In one of his plays  Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying  who says to those gathered around his bed   The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.  How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying  Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics  even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory  and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course  you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering  that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science  the arts and human enterprise  yet they also are full of anger  hypocrisy and have    and self hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion. On November           Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words   I submit myself  absolutely  to Jesus Christ  my redeemer.  A French historian said  two centuries later   Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.  Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony  but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven  and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well known words   The heart has its reasons  which reason knows not of.  Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially  he said this   if you bet on God  and open yourself to his love  you lose nothing  even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God  then you can lose it all  in this life and the life to come.  For Pascal  scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of   . King David lived to be     a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death  and he wrote these words   even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  I will fear no evil  for you are with me.  This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil  suffering and death. It can be yours  as well  as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was    years of age  I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning  and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were    of them that I had    that I was responsible for  and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college  until something happened in my heart. One day  I was faced face to face with Christ. He said   I am the way  the truth and the life.  Can you imagine that   I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.  He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he  I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said  I believe him  and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready  when I hear that call  to go into the presence of God. Thank you  and God bless all of you. Thank you for the privilege. It was great. Richard Wurman  You did it. Thanks. I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments. So  I work for Esquire magazine  and a couple of years ago  I wrote an article called  My Outsourced Life   where I hired a team of people in Bangalore  India  to live my life for me. So  they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me  and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life  because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience. More recently  I wrote an article for Esquire called    about radical honesty. And this is a movement where    this is started by a psychologist in Virginia  who says that you should never  ever lie  except maybe during poker and golf  his only exceptions. And  more than that  whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So  I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience  the article was called   I Think You're Fat.  So  that was hard. My most recent book    my previous book was called  The Know It All   and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world  or more precisely from Aak  which is a type of East Asian music  all the way to Zwyiec  which is    well  I don't want to ruin the ending. It's a very exciting twist ending  like an O. Henry novel  so I won't ruin it. But I love that one  because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although  listening to Kevin Kelly  you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So  I wasted some time there. I love those experiments  but I think that the most profound and life changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment  where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible   The Year of Living Biblically.  And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book  I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. So  not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time  or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So  I decided to dive in head first  and try to live the Bible. The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism  religious fundamentalism  and people who say they take the Bible literally  which is  according to some polls  as high as    or    percent of America. So I decided  what if you really did take the Bible literally  I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally  without picking and choosing. The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible  where the twenty third Psalm is rendered as   The Lord is all that   as opposed to what I knew it as   The Lord is my shepherd.  Then I went down and I read several versions  and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list    over     rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of    The Ten Commandments  love your neighbor  be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually  I take my projects very seriously  because I had twins during my year  so I definitely take my projects seriously. But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus   You cannot shave the corners of your beard.  I didn't know where my corners were  so I decided to let the whole thing grow  and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine  I spent a lot of time at airport security. My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So  certainly the challenge was there. The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers  so I thought   Sounds strange  but I'll try it.  You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly cotton T shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight  and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man  then her hand shall be cut off. So  I wanted to follow that rule. That one I followed by default  by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby  looking like she had a strong grip. So    oh  there's another shot of my beard. I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing  and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know  I could spend a year not killing  but spending a year not gossiping  not coveting  not lying    you know  I live in New York  and I work as a journalist  so this was        percent of my day I had to do it. But it was really interesting  because I was able to make some progress  because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year  is that I almost pretended to be a better person  and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought  you know   You change your mind  and you change your behavior   but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior  and you change your mind. So  you know  if you want to become more compassionate  you visit sick people in the hospital  and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause  and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So  it really was cognitive psychology    you know  cognitive dissonance    that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology  very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs  it says that if you smile  you will become happier  which  as we know  is actually true. The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. But it's a big part of the Bible  so I figured I had to address it. So  I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened    I was in the park  and I was dressed in my biblical clothing  so sandals and sort of a white robe  you know  because again  the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said   Why are you dressed like that   And I explained my project  and he said   Well  I am an adulterer  are you going to stone me   And I said   Well  that would be great   And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks  hoping for just this interaction    and  you know  they were pebbles    but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man  mid   s  just so you know. But he's still an adulterer  and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face  and I felt that I could    eye for an eye    I could retaliate  and throw one back at him. So that was my experience stoning  and it did allow me to talk about  in a more serious way  these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places  and yet so incredibly wise in others  How should we view the Bible  Should we view it  you know  as original intent  like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible  How was the Bible written  And actually  since this is a tech crowd  I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia  because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take aways  the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is  thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very  very clear  early on. Because if you do  then you end up acting like a crazy person  and stoning adulterers  or    here's another example. Well  that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. But this one is    the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month  and more than that  you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive  so she sat in every seat in our apartment  and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around. So  you know  I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating  because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. And I will say  though  the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky  there's  you can see a movie of the flood  and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So  whatever you think of creationism    and I think it's crazy    they did a great job. Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying  giving these prayers of thanksgiving  which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time  every day  and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day  that I didn't even notice  that I took for granted  as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So  this is actually a key to happiness for me  is to just remember when I came over here  the car didn't flip over  and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing. Third  that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic  and by the end of the year  I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic  which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So  if anyone wants to join  the basic idea is  whether or not there is a God  there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness  and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year  doing the Sabbath  because I am a workaholic  so having this one day where you cannot work  it really  that changed my life. So  this idea of sacredness  whether or not there is a God. Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So  I spent time with evangelical Christians  and Hasidic Jews  and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible talk a Jehovah's Witness. After three and a half hours  he looked at his watch  he's like   I gotta go.  Oh  thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you  bless you. But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about  for instance  evangelical Christianity  and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians  and they focus on the red words in the Bible  which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says   Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality   and you open it up  and there's nothing in it. So  they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts  helping poor people. So  this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders  even though I disagree with much of what they say. Also  thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because  you know  I grew up with the scientific worldview  and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is  if they're not harmful  they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that    I was thinking  I was doing all these rituals  these biblical rituals  separating my wool and linen  and I would ask these religious people  Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this  Why would God care   And they said   We don't know  but it's just rituals that give us meaning.  And I would say   But that's crazy.  And they would say   Well  what about you  You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw  here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics  would the Martians say  'Well  that guy  he makes sense  but that guy's crazy '  So no  I think that rituals are  by nature  irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals  the ones that are not harmful    but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed. And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion  and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way  and they'll say   Oh  it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.  But my argument is   What's wrong with cafeterias   I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So  it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion  about tolerance  about loving your neighbor  as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin  or intolerance  or violence  which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book  then we have to really engage it  and wrestle with it. And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. Seriously  and it worked. And yes  that was actually a rented sheep  so I had to return that in the morning  but it served well for a day. So  anyway  thank you so much for letting me speak. Brain magic. What's brain magic all about  Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects. So unlike traditional magic  it uses the power of words  linguistic deception  non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense. I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me  first of all. OK  clap them together  once. OK  reverse your hands. Now  follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that  OK  swap them around  put your right hand up. Cross your hands over  so your right hand goes over  interlace your fingers like this  then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb    that's very important. Yours is the other way around  so swap it around. Excellent  OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK  now  if you did not allow me to deceive your minds  you would all be able to do this. Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind  once you know how. Now  I remember when I was about     I read a copy of Life magazine  which detailed a story about a    year old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters    there's still people trying to do it       who could sense printed letters and even sense colors  just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed  face down  on a hard surface. Now  I was fascinated  but at the same time  skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips  You know  if you actually think about it  if somebody is totally blind    a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms  where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips  Now earlier on  as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV  I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So  let's take a look. I'm going to guide you into the car. Kathryn Thomas   Laughter  Man  You're OK  keep on going. KT  How are you  Keith Barry  Kathryn  it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location  OK  Kathryn  there was no way you could see through that blindfold. KT  OK  but don't say my name like that. KB  But you're OK  KT  Yes. KB  No way to see through it  KT  No. KB  I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off  Take it off  you're OK. We'll stop for a second. KT  I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see. KB  You're fine  take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight  KT  No. KB  Second sight is whereby a mind control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now. KT  God. KB  Are you ready  Where is it  There's no way    KT   Beep  KT  Oh  my God  KB  Don't say anything  I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see. KT  There's a wall  there's a wall. KB  Look at the road  look at the road. KT  OK  OK  OK. Oh  my God  KB  Now  anything coming at all  KT  No. KB  Sure there's not  KT  No  no  I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road  all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road. KT  Oh  my God  KB  Where are we  Where are we  We're going uphill  are we going uphill  KT  Look at the road     Beep  Still got that goddamn blindfold on. KB  What  KT  How are you doing this  KB  Just don't break my concentration. We're OK  though  KT  Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh  my God  Oh  my God  KB  And I've stopped. KT  That is weird. You're like a freak ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life  KB  Thank you. By the way  two days ago  we were going to film this down there  at the race course  and we got a guy into a car  and we got a camera man in the back  but halfway through the drive  he told me he had  I think it was a nine millimeter  stuck to his leg. So  I stopped pretty quick  and that was it. So  do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes  That's the question. Now  most people here would automatically say no. OK  but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl  I'd never met before  all right. So  I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened  all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception  the solutions you come up with will     percent of the time  be way off the mark. This is because magic is all about directing attention. If  for instance  I didn't want you to look at my right hand  then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand  then I look at it  too. You see  it's very simple  once you know how  but very complicated in other ways. I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up  And let's see  down at the end  here  can you also come up  real quick  Do you mind  Yes  at the end. OK  give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs  there. It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen  right  Would you mind just standing over here for a moment  Your name is  Nicole  Nicole. KB  Nicole  and  KB  Actually  here's the thing  answer it  answer it  answer it. Is it a girl  Man  They've already gone. KB  OK  swap over positions. Can you stand over here  This will make it easier. Pity  I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK  a little bit closer. OK  a little bit closer  come over    they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft  Nicole  No. KB  Voodoo  Nicole  No. KB  Things that go bump in the night  Nicole  No. KB  Besides  who's next  no  OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me  pull up your sleeves  if you don't mind. OK  now  I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you  because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations  but don't say anything until I ask you  and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards  close your eyes  do not say anything  do not open them  be aware of the sensations. Yes or no  did you feel anything  Nicole  Yes. KB  You did feel that  What did you feel  Nicole  A touch on my back. KB  How many times did you feel it  Nicole  Twice. KB  Twice. OK  extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm  OK. OK  keep it there. Be aware of the sensations  don't say anything  don't open your eyes  OK. Did you feel anything  there  Nicole  Yes. KB  What did you feel  Nicole  Three    KB  Like a tickling sensation  Nicole  Yes. KB  Can you show us where  OK  excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back  and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment. Yeah  I walk around nightclubs all night like this. You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again  in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here  if you don't mind. Sit right here. Man  OK. KB  OK  take a seat. Excellent  OK. Now  what I want you to do is look directly at me  OK  just take a deep breath in through your nose  letting it out through your mouth  and relax. Allow your eyes to close  on five  four  three  two  one. Close your eyes right now. OK  now  I'm not hypnotizing you  I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity  so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind  I'm going to take your left hand  and just place it up here. I want you to hold it there just for a moment  and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness  and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it  all the way down  all the way down. and further  and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK  now  allow it to stay there. OK  now  in a moment  you'll feel a certain pressure  OK  and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release  but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand  Just answer yes or no. Man  Yes. KB  Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back  allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop  but only when you feel the pressure. OK  that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again. Excellent. Now that you've got the idea  let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop  keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up  Just stand  stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released  make an upward gesture  like this  but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want  but only when you want the pressure released. OK  let's try it again. OK  now  imagine the connection  OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released  we'll try it again. OK  it worked that time  excellent. And hold it there  both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back  make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly  but it went down  OK. Now  I want you to be aware that in a moment  when I snap my fingers  your eyes will open  again. It's OK to remember to forget  or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you   What the hell just happened up here   But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized  you will forget everything that happened. On five  four  three  two  one    open your eyes  wide awake. Give them a round of applause  as they go back to their seats. OK  you can go back. I once saw a film called  The Gods Are Crazy.  Has anybody here seen that film  Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane  and it landed on the ground  and it didn't break  Now  see  that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it  Good job. She's not taking any chances. You see  psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists  sometimes the spoon will bend or melt  sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table  sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day  so on and so forth. We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis  right now. Come right over here  next to me. Excellent. Now  have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid  there's only one hole  and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table  if you want  be careful. Even though it's solid  I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now  I've got a shard of glass here  OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful  it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now  hold it out here. I want you to imagine  right now  a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship  from that guy  being imparted into the broken piece of glass  which will represent him  OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass  ignore everybody right here. In a moment  you'll feel a certain sensation  OK  and when you feel that sensation  I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy  that ba    that guy. I'm trying to be good here. OK  and when you feel the sensation    it might take a while    drop it into the glass. OK  drop it in. Now  imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side. That was a lot of negative energy  built up in there. I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK  think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that  so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name  there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also  but his name doesn't start with a K  it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello  the next time you see him. Was that his name  Nicole  Mm hmm. KB  OK  give her a round of applause. Thank you. I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually  Chris  I was going to pick you for this  but instead of picking you  can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment  And it should be a male victim  that's the only thing. Chris Anderson  Oh  OK. KB  I was going to use you  but I decided I might want to come back another year. CA  Well  to reward him for saying  eureka   and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us    Steve Jurvetson. KB  OK  Steve  come on up here. CA  You knew  KB  OK  Steve  I want you to take a seat  right behind here. Excellent. Now  Steve    oh  you can check underneath. Go ahead  I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician  put a nice  black tablecloth on. There you are  OK. I've got four wooden plinths here  Steve. One  two  three and four. Now  they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it  and make sure it's solid. Happy  Steve Jurvetson  Mmm  yes. KB  OK. Now  Steve  I'm going to stand in front of the table  When I stand in front of the table  I want you to put the cups on the plinths  in any order you want  and then mix them all up  so nobody has any idea where the spike is  all right  SJ  No one in the audience  KB  Yes  and just to help you out  I'll block them from view  so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So  go ahead and mix them up  now. OK  and tell me when you're done. KB  You done  SJ  Almost. KB  Almost  oh. OK  you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh  we've got one here  we've got one here. So  all right  we'll leave them like that. I'm going to have the last laugh  though. Now  Steve  you know where the spike is  but nobody else  does  Correct  But I don't want you to know either  so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No  stay around  OK. Now  Steve  look back. Now you don't know where the spike is  and I don't know where it is either. Now  is there any way to see through this blindfold  SJ  Put this on  KB  No  just  is there any way to see through it  No  SJ  No  I can't see through it. KB  Excellent. Now  I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up  OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups  I don't want anybody to see where the spike is  but give the plinths an extra mix up  and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK  go ahead  mix them up. My hand is at risk here. Tell me when you're done. SJ  Done. KB  OK  where are you  Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup. SJ  You're over a cup. KB  I'm over a cup  right now  SJ  Mm hmm. KB  Now  Steve  do you think it's here  Yes or no  SJ  Oh  KB  I told you I'd have the last laugh. SJ  I don't think it's there. KB  No  Good decision. Now  if I go this way  is there another cup over here  SJ  Can we do the left hand  KB  Oh  no  no  no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not. KB  If I go this way  is there another cup  SJ  Yes. KB  Tell me when to stop. SJ  OK. KB  There  SJ  Yes  there's one. KB  OK. Do you think it's here  yes or no  This is your decision  not mine. SJ  I'm going to say no. KB  Good decision. OK  give me both hands. Now  put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand  SJ  Neither. KB  Neither  oh  OK. But if you were to guess. SJ  Under my right hand. KB  Under your right hand  Now  remember  you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists  figure this out. Have a look. SJ  Oh  KB  Thank you. If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on  I'll be outside. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When I was president of the American Psychological Association  they tried to media train me  and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today  which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us    of them  I'm going to give you the eleventh. So they came to me    CNN    and they said   Professor Seligman  would you tell us about the state of psychology today  We'd like to interview you about that.  And I said   Great.  And she said   But this is CNN  so you only get a sound bite.  So I said   Well  how many words do I get   And she said   Well  one.  And cameras rolled  and she said   Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Good.   Cut. Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.   Well  how many words do I get this time    I think  well  you get two. Doctor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good.   Look  Doctor Seligman  we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman  what is the state of psychology today    Not good enough.  And that's what I'm going to be talking about. I want to say why psychology was good  why it was not good and how it may become  in the next    years  good enough. And by parallel summary  I want to say the same thing about technology  about entertainment and design  because I think the issues are very similar. So  why was psychology good  Well  for more than    years  psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago  when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate  and told them what I did  they'd move away from me. And because  quite rightly  they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now  when I tell people what I do  they move toward me. And what was good about psychology  about the    billion dollar investment NIMH made  about working in the disease model  about what you mean by psychology  is that     years ago  none of the disorders were treatable    it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now     of the disorders are treatable  two of them actually curable. And the other thing that happened is that a science developed  a science of mental illness. That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts    like depression  alcoholism    and measure them with rigor. That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses. That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people    people  for example  who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia    and ask what the contribution of mothering  of genetics are  and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses. And best of all  we were able  in the last    years  to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously  in random assignment  placebo controlled designs  throw out the things that didn't work  keep the things that actively did. And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry  over the last    years  can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good  the consequences of that were three things. The first was moral  that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists  pathologizers  that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble  bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost. The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier  more fulfilled  more productive. And  genius    high talent   became a dirty word. No one works on that. And the third problem about the disease model is  in our rush to do something about people in trouble  in our rush to do something about repairing damage  it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier  positive interventions. So that was not good. And so  that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff  Dan Gilbert  Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology  which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling  and with genius  with nurturing high talent. So in the last    years and the hope for the future  we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology  a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you  for free  can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask  how do you stack up for positive emotion  for meaning  for flow  against literally tens of thousands of other people  We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities  a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio  how they're defined  how to diagnose them  what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states  the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness. I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people  and I've asked the question  how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you  And starting about six years ago  we asked about extremely happy people. And how do they differ from the rest of us  And it turns out there's one way. They're not more religious  they're not in better shape  they don't have more money  they're not better looking  they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ  they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning. They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends. But watch out here. This is merely correlational data  not causal  and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about  happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough  in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries  from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About     interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them  and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is  which ones actually make people lastingly happier  In a couple of minutes  I'll tell you about some of those results. But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have  in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill  and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable  is can psychology actually make people happier  And to ask that question    happy is not a word I use very much    we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy. And I believe there are three different    and I call them different because different interventions build them  it's possible to have one rather than the other    three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can  and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement    a life in your work  your parenting  your love  your leisure  time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third  the meaningful life. So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them. The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply  as best we can find it  it's having as many of the pleasures as you can  as much positive emotion as you can  and learning the skills    savoring  mindfulness    that amplify them  that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks  and it's why positive psychology is not happy ology and why it doesn't end here. The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life  your experience of positive emotion  is heritable  about    percent heritable  and  in fact  not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu  Ricard  and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are    to    percent tricks  getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly  indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream  the first taste is a     percent  by the time you're down to the sixth taste  it's gone. And  as I said  it's not particularly malleable. And this leads to the second life. And I have to tell you about my friend  Len  to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion  more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life  by the time Len was     Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was     he was an options trader. By the time he was     he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second  in play    he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life  love  Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was  was that Len is a cold fish. Len is an introvert. American women said to Len  when he dated them   You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.  And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst  who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that    Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football  and played bridge    Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities. The question is  is Len unhappy  And I want to say not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom    percent of the human race in positive affectivity  I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len  like most of you  is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at      in the morning  time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played  until    days later  the tournament is over  time stops for Len. And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about  about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way. Pleasure has raw feels  you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday    during flow  you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it  and it's knowing what your highest strengths are. And again  there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are. And then re crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re crafting your work  your love  your play  your friendship  your parenting. Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence  so she re crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths  and re craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption. So  that's the second path. The first path  positive emotion. The second path is eudaimonian flow. And the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses  traditionally. And meaning  in this view  consists of    very parallel to eudaimonia    it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are  and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are. I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives  the pleasant life  the good life  the meaningful life  people are now hard at work on the question  are there things that lastingly change those lives  And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random assignment  placebo controlled  long term studies of different interventions. And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect  when we teach people about the pleasant life  how to have more pleasure in your life  one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills  the savoring skills  and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday  set a day aside  design yourself a beautiful day  and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced. Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now  if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction  and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. OK. Now  OK  you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment  when you're learning the gratitude visit  is to write a     word testimonial to that person  call them on the phone in Phoenix  ask if you can visit  don't tell them why  show up at their door  you read the testimonial    everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is when we test people one week later  a month later  three months later  they're both happier and less depressed. Another example is a strength date  in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test  and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths  and we find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. But it's so heartening to be in a group like this  in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well  my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this  so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun  and to contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun  it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person  it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions. So  the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. And this is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives  how much life satisfaction do you get  So we ask    and we've done this in    replications involving thousands of people    to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure  the pursuit of positive emotion  the pleasant life  the pursuit of engagement  time stopping for you  and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction  And our results surprised us  but they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning  then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say  the full life    the sum is greater than the parts  if you've got all three. Conversely  if you have none of the three  the empty life  the sum is less than the parts. And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship  physical health  morbidity  how long you live and productivity  follow the same relationship  That is  in a corporation  is productivity a function of positive emotion  engagement and meaning  Is health a function of positive engagement  of pleasure  and of meaning in life  And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes. So  Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard  and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much  which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology  entertainment and design in the following way. We all know that technology  entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology  entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way  the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought  when I first became a therapist    years ago  that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed  not anxious  not angry  that I'd make them happy. And I never found that. I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero. But they were empty. And it turns out the skills of happiness  the skills of the pleasant life  the skills of engagement  the skills of meaning  are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so  the parallel thing holds with technology  entertainment and design  I believe. That is  it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness  to increase positive emotion  and that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do    not just positive emotion  that's not nearly enough    there's flow in life  and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us  design  and  I believe  entertainment and technology  can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well. So in conclusion  the eleventh reason for optimism  in addition to the space elevator  is that I think with technology  entertainment and design  we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can  in the next decade or two  increase the pleasant life  the good life and the meaningful life  it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion  meaning  eudaimonia  it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion  eudaimonia  and flow and meaning  what we're all doing together will become good enough. Thank you. My search is always to find ways to chronicle  to share and to document stories about people  just everyday people. Stories that offer transformation  that lean into transcendence  but that are never sentimental  that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said  I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation    in the '  s    of students who were protesting a military dictatorship  which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me  there was a whole generation of us. But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures  but in the simple accumulation of gentle  soft  almost invisible acts of compassion  everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa  they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says  the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me  my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it  I don't pay attention to it until there's  you know  like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it  and usually  it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple  but really very complicated. So  I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people  so I thought I'd start with my mother. And she was dark  too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '  s  and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two  very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is    or was  she just passed. She came out to California  to Los Angeles  to visit me  and we went to Malibu  which she thought was very disappointing. And then we went to a fish restaurant  and we had Chad  the surfer dude  serving us  and he came up and my mother said   Do you have any specials  young man   And Chad says   Sure  like  we have this  like  salmon  that's  like  rolled in this  like  wasabi  like  crust. It's totally rad.  And my mother turned to me and said   What language is he speaking   I said   English  mum.  And she shook her head and said   Oh  these Americans. We gave them a language  why don't they use it   So  this woman  who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father    and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert    decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria  particularly among Igbo women  the Billings ovulation method  which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. So  here are these women  who never discuss their period with their husbands  and here I am telling them   Well  how often do you get your period   And   Do you notice any discharges   And   How swollen is your vulva   She never would have thought of herself as a feminist  my mother  but she always used to say   Anything a man can do  I can fix.  And when my father complained about this situation  where she's taking a seven year old boy to teach this birth control  you know  he used to say   Oh  you're turning him into    you're teaching him how to be a woman.  My mother said   Someone has to.  This woman    during the Biafran war  we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year  through refugee camp after refugee camp  to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp  she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark  who was nine  and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five foot two woman  standing up to men with guns who want to kill us  All through that one year  my mother never cried one time  not once. But when we were in Lisbon  in the airport  about to fly to England  this woman saw my mother wearing this dress  which had been washed so many times it was basically see through  with five really hungry looking kids  came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother  and to us  and the toys of her kids  who didn't like that very much  but    that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later  I was writing about my mother  and I asked her   Why did you cry then   And she said   You know  you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble  any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.  The old women in my father's village  after this war had happened  memorized the names of every dead person  and they would sing these dirges  made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice  as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time  they would sing these joyful songs  that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season  when they sang the dirge  they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way  these women enacted a lot of transformation  beautiful transformation. Did you know  that before the genocide in Rwanda  the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one  But today  women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid  when the new government went into the parliament houses  there were no female toilets in the building  Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say  that despite the horror  and despite the death  women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us. When I was growing up in Nigeria    and I shouldn't say Nigeria  because that's too general  but in Afikpo  the Igbo part of the country where I'm from    there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women  that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing  killing little animals  progressing along  so when I turned       and  I mean  it made sense  it was an agrarian community  somebody had to kill the animals  there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at    so when I turned     it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird  sensitive kid  who couldn't really do it  but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine  called Emmanuel  who was significantly older than me  who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war  decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good  because he'd seen a lot of things. Now  when I was growing up  he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people  and their intestines would fall out  but they would keep running. So  this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat  or seen one    they sound like human beings  that's why we call tragedies  a song of a goat.  My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway  a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't  Emmanuel bent down  he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat  covers its eyes  so I don't have to look into them  while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot  for this guy who'd seen so much  and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience  still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards  he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me   It will always be difficult  but if you cry like this every time  you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.  Of course  talking about goats makes me think of sheep  and not in good ways. So  I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up  you know  I had a cake and everything  but I never got any presents  because  born two days after Christmas. So  I was about nine  and my uncle had just come back from Germany  and we had the Catholic priest over  my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says   Where are Chris' presents   And my mother said   Don't talk about that in front of guests.  But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back  so he summoned me up  and he said   Go into the bedroom  my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.  I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt  but I found an inflatable sheep. So  I blew it up and ran into the living room  my finger where it shouldn't have been  I was waving this buzzing sheep around  and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered  just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said   It's all right Daphne  I'm Scottish.  My last days in prison  the last    months  my cellmate    for the last year  the first year of the last    months    my cellmate was    years old. The name was John James  and in those days  if a family member committed a crime  the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So  here was this    year old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics  two comic books     Spiderman  and  X Men.  He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them  he started to teach the men in death row how to read  with these comic books. And so  I remember night after night  you'd hear all these men  these really hardened criminals  huddled around John James  reciting   Take that  Spidey   It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice  and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh  and say   Come on  man  we'll make it out.  Then I'd say   How do you know   And he said   Oh  I heard it on the grapevine.  They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair  and they tacked his penis to a table with a six inch nail  then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary  because I let my feelings be known. All around us  everywhere  there are people like this. The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community  and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest  who would find a ritual object  and the appropriate sacrifices would be made  and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice  the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine  and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day  all of us here  we're building gods that have gone rampant  and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us  every day    the few of us that can see    are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you. There are some of you in this room  amazing people  who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called  Libation   and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere.  Libation  North Carolina      . I offer to this ground  this gin. I imagine an old man crying here  out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be  if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be  where his land would be  his house  his wife  his son  his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face  and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue  and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you  old man. This gin  this salty earth.  Thank you. Who are we  That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright walking  big brained  super intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens  and it's important to remember that  in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately  or let's say  at least    upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know  we're the only upright walking ape that exists on planet Earth today  except for the bonobos. And it's important to remember that  because the bonobos are so human  and they share    percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now  I know that's a dirty word for some people  but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas  the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past  and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity  and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family  as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past. And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa  looking for small fragments of bone  fossil bone  that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya  looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture  but if you look very carefully  there is a jaw  a lower jaw  of a  .  million year old upright walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. It's extremely time consuming  labor intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people  to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it. When we find a fossil  we mark it. Today  we've got great technology  we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix  and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen  so we could essentially put it back on the surface  exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages  today. When we then find something very important  like the bones of a human ancestor  we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly  using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens  and where we go again through it very carefully  looking for small bone fragments  and it's then washed. And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only  or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment  when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. Not many people can say that. But now  let me take you back to Africa  two million years ago. I'd just like to point out  if you look at the map of Africa  it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden  or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin  and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin  carrying sediment  preserving the bones of animals that lived there. If you want to become a fossil  you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. OK  so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors  because it's incredibly difficult  A  for these things to become    to be    preserved  and secondly  for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent    years looking for these remains  and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story. So  let's go to Lake Turkana  which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country  Kenya. And if you look north here  there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin  which represents some        square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana  Homo erectus  one of our human ancestors  actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But  essentially  two million years ago  Homo erectus  up in the far right corner  lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus  which I just pulled off the shelf there. But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact  if you go back in time  it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from  That's what we're still trying to find answers to  and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species  and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana. But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya  essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up  when we got old enough  fossils such as this  a slender snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises  and elephants and things like that. But when I was     as I was in this picture  a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side  when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus. I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well  because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall  dark skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey  probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself  this one that I'm holding up here  actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female  and probably much smaller  members of his family group  to have got to where he did in life  age   . Unfortunately for him  he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially  his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved. And he remained there until  .  million years later  when this very famous fossil hunter  Kamoya Kimeu  walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles  recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well  an excavation was begun immediately  and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this  the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree  and fairly recently the tree had grown up  but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside  and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this  holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones  we found finger bones  the bones of the pelvis  vertebrae  ribs  the collar bones  things that had never  ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own  and he was on the threshold of becoming human. Well  shortly afterwards  members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa  and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia  China and also in parts of Indonesia. So  Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds  again  as I mentioned  from Dmanisi  in the Republic of Georgia. But also  surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia  where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated  and have become dwarfed  and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only        years ago  and that is truly extraordinary to think about. Just to put this in terms of generations  because people do find it hard to think of time  Homo erectus left Africa        generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again  at about         years as a fully fledged us. And we only left Africa about        years ago. And until        years ago  at least three upright walking apes shared the planet Earth. The question now is  well  who are we  We're certainly a polluting  wasteful  aggressive species  with a few nice things thrown in  perhaps. For the most part  we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation  or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet Earth  And what is it that really makes us us  I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down  our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings  with a very crude tool kit of stones  we now have a very advanced tool kit  and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels  we've got buggies to Mars  we've mapped the human genome  and recently even created synthetic life  thanks to Craig Venter. And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world  from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya  we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us  we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth  if you look at the fossil record  for about  on average  a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past         years as a species  yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people. And last year  our population grew by    million. I mean  these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here  again  taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers  and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers  because we can't really hold it together as a species. My father so appropriately put it  that  We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.  Can we hold it together  It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking  we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice  and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there  if we really wanted to. But will we do that  or will we just let nature take its course  Well  to end on a very positive note  I think evolutionarily speaking  this is probably a fairly good thing  in the end. I'll leave it at that  thank you very much. So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight  cut off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway  it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality    so  real stories. And specifically  I'm interested in collecting my own stories  stories from the Internet  and then recently  stories from life  which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So  first of all  my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books  and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life  and I fill them with all sorts of things  records of my lived experience  so watercolor paintings  drawings of what I see  dead flowers  dead insects  pasted ticket stubs  rusting coins  business cards  writings. And in these books  you can find these short  little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And  you know  after keeping these books for a number of years  I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts  but also the artifacts of other people. So  I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about    years ago. On the front  you can see the tattered black and white photo of a woman's face  and on the back it says   To Judy  the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.  And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story  just knowing a little bit of the story  and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So  around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University  and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts  not just from street corners  but also from the Internet. And that suddenly  people  en masse  were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts  photographs  thoughts  feelings  opinions  all of these things were being expressed by people online  and leaving behind trails. So  I started to write computer programs that study very  very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called  We Feel Fine.  This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes  searching for occurrences of the phrases  I feel  and  I am feeling.  And when it finds one of those phrases  it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So  their gender  their age  their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about        such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half  having collected over    and a half million feelings now. This is  then  how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English speaking world's feelings from the last few hours  each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside  so the bright ones are happy  and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short  and the bigger ones are longer.  I feel fine with the body I'm in  there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend   from a twenty two year old in Japan.  I got this on some trading locally  but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.  Also  some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens  these montage compositions are automatically created  which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.  I feel good.   I feel rough now  and I probably gained         pounds  but it was worth it.   I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature    butterflies  man made forests  limestone caves and hey  even a huge python.  So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now  dominated by better  then bad  then good  then guilty  and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around  the cloudy ones float along  the rainy ones fall down  and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally  location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map  giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from  We Feel Fine.  These are the images that are automatically constructed.  I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.   I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good  the kisses felt messy and wrong  but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.   I can feel my cancer grow.   I feel pretty.   I feel skinny  but I'm not.   I'm     and a recovering meth and heroin addict  and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.   I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month  because I feel the need for speed.   I feel sassy.   I feel so sexy in this new wig.  As you can see   We Feel Fine  collects very  very small scale personal stories. Sometimes  stories as short as two or three words. So  really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently  I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world  not with the Internet  and only using the Internet at the very last moment  as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called  The Whale Hunt.  Last May  I spent nine days living up in Barrow  Alaska  the northernmost settlement in the United States  with a family of Inupiat Eskimos  documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here  we're about six miles from shore  camping on five and a half feet of thick  frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead  and through that lead  bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here  waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does  it throws a harpoon at it  and then hauls the whale up under the ice  and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there  and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here  and photographed the entire experience  beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York  and ending with the butchering of the second whale  seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals. So every five minutes  I took a photograph. When I was awake  with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping  with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline  like when something exciting was happening  I would up that photographic frequency to as many as    photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down  more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story  So  stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like  They have time. When did it take place  Dates    when did it occur  And in the case of the whale hunt  also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories  though  in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to    things like novels  radio  photographs  movies  even lectures like this one    we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position  some kind of omniscient  external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life  it's not like that at all. I mean  in real life  things are much more nuanced and complex  and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So  in the case of  The Whale Hunt   how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford  involving the concepts of wildlife  tools and blood  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  dominated by the color red  happening around    a.m. on May    with an excitement level of high  So  how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story  I built a web interface for viewing  The Whale Hunt  that attempts to do just this. So these are all       pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean  and the butchering of the second whale  seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here  told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here  when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline  showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same  so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked  and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's  Moby Dick.  This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside    I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp  on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph  showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub stories. So  here you see the cast. These are all of the people in  The Whale Hunt  and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as  say  extract the story of Rony  involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools  taking place on the Arctic Ocean  at Ahkivgaq camp  with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just    matching photographs  and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about    feet long  and weighing over    tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here  this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything  it's entirely just blades  and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope  pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk  or the blubber  all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So  just yesterday  I flew in here from Singapore  and before that  I was spending two weeks in Bhutan  the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness  interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product  and they've been doing this since the '  s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non materialistic culture  where people don't have a lot  but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So  I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions  and took a number of set photographs  and interviewed them with audio  and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and     which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered  I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So  you have some really happy person holding    balloons  and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know  even holding one balloon is like  kind of happy. And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life  what makes them happy. And then finally  I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish  I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did  some of the people I spoke with. This is an    year old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends  running around town  and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands  because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody  and asked everybody to make a funny face. A    year old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan  and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A    year old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like  you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A    year old farmer. She was chaffing wheat  and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word  love  engraved on it  and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A    year old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight  but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A    year old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face  which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A    year old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that  and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married  because  in her opinion  when you get married in Bhutan as a woman  your chances to live an independent life kind of end  and so she had no interest in that. A    year old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one lane roads with two lane traffic  with       foot drop offs right next to the road  and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life  like other people. A    year old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm  right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road  and she wanted a different lot on things. An    year old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road  and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work  and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me  so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good natured. A    year old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read  but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange  sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into  and since there was so much saliva on his hands  this orange paste started to form on his palms. A    year old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads  and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A    year old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish  and she said   You know  maybe I'll live  maybe I'll die  but I don't have a wish.  She was chewing betel nut  which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally  this is a    year old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said   Well  you know  of course  it's impermanent  but my plan is to live here until I'm     and then enter a hermitage.  And I said   You mean  like a cave   And she said   Yeah  like a cave.  And I said   Wow  and how long will you live in the cave   And she said   Well  you know  I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.  I just thought that was amazing. I mean  she spoke in a way    with amazing English  and amazing humor  and amazing laughter    that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York  or in Vermont  where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there  you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year  what would she do for the next    years in her life  And this is what she said. Woman  I think I'm going to stay for   . Maybe    maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris  Maybe you'll die  Woman  Yes. JH     years  Woman  Yes  yes. JH     years  that's a long time. Woman  Yes  not maybe one     years  maybe I can die within one year  or something like that. JH  Are you hoping to  Woman  Ah  because you know  it's impermanent. JH  Yeah  but    yeah  OK. Do you hope    would you prefer to live in the cave for    years  or to live for one year  Woman  But I prefer for maybe    to   . JH     to     Yeah. Woman  Yes. From then  I'm going to the heaven. JH  Well  I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman  Thank you. JH  I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again  so much. Woman  You're most welcome. JH  So if you caught that  she said she hoped to die when she was around   . That was enough life for her. So  the last thing we did  very quickly  is I took all those wish balloons    there were     interviews      wishes    and I brought them up to a place called Dochula  which is a mountain pass in Bhutan  at        feet  one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there  there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re inflated all of the balloons  put them up on a string  and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future  you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here.  To make some money and to open a store  was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. To be new at TED    it's like being the last high school virgin. You know that all of the cool people are    they're doing it. And you're on the outside  you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers  where you've got your balls in cold water. And    you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside  and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you  Chris  and also  thank you  Deborah Patton  for making this possible. So anyway  today we'll talk about architecture a little bit  within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together  you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism    which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience  at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it    or you can talk about optimisations  spelled the British way  with an S  instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture    which is  in fact  what you were just talking about  what was going on here  setting up TED  small scale architecture    at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this  the World Trade Center  and what's been going on there  what it means to us. Because if architecture is what I believe it to be  which is the built form of our cultural ambitions  what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us  And our own opportunity to make something new there  This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in  rather an unfortunate way  brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time  and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember  in my    year career of practicing and writing about architecture  a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning  fire exiting  safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet  now  it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings  you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way  we're going to think about it like this. How many of you saw USA Today  today  There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site  on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind  the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child prodigy piano player  he started on the squeezebox  and moved to a little more serious issue  a bigger instrument  and now to an even larger instrument  upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic  as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition  after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go   Oh  I'm really sorry  we screwed up.  Right. Can we do this again from the top  except use some people with a vague hint of talent  instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time  real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this  or we had a choice of that. Oh  stop clapping. It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK  a New York based team  and then there was that one  which was the Libeskind scheme. This one  this is going to be the new World Trade Center  a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now  I don't know what you think  but I think this is a pretty stupid decision  because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents  and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects  in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything    that there is a large  technical answer that can solve all problems  be they social  be they physical  be they chemical    or something that's more of a romantic solution. Now  I don't mean romantic as in  this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of  there are things larger and grander than us. So  in the American tradition  the difference between the technocratic and the romantic  would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States  that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States  as a really  truly  technocratic solution  a bowing to the    in Jefferson's time    current  popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later  manifest destiny. Now  which would you rather be  A grid  or manifest destiny  Manifest destiny. It's a big deal. It sounds big  it sounds important  it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy  serious  male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean  it goes on in our private lives  too  every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT  don't we  Everyone here must own one  or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it  turned the little electronic key  rather than the real key  zipped home on their new superhighway  and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle. Why  Why  Why do you want to do that  Why do we all want to do that  I even owned a Tudor thing once myself. It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger  sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment  I'm going to talk about two architects very  very briefly that represent the current split  architecturally  between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young  one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP  and what you're seeing here  is their isometric drawings of what will be a large scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is  Yeah  it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world    it's sort of a little movie  without any moving parts    and projects it on a page  and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it. This is just the outline of it  and you can see  does it look like a regular building  No. It's actually non orthogonal  it's not up and down  square  rectangular  anything like that  that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution  the technocratic  technological revolution  has allowed us to jettison normal shaped buildings  traditionally shaped buildings  in favor of non orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand new way to put buildings together  something called mass customization. No  it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive  in the traditional sense  is making individual parts custom  that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing     times. That's because it's cheaper. Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer  a program that says  manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine    a computer operated machine  a cad cam machine    that can make a zillion different changes  at a moment's notice  because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer    it's simply an electronic lathe  so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile  instead of sending someone working drawings  which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life  what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions  like you used to get when you were a child  when you bought little models that said   Bolt A to B  and C to D.  And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off site and delivered on a truck to the site  to that builder  and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple  Bolt A to B  and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works    and that's what will happen in the end. You're underneath it  looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction  lest you think this is all fantasy  or romance  these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS   which is a museum in Brooklyn  New York  as part of their young architects summer series. And they said  well  it's summer  what do you do  In the summer  you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach  what do you get  You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs  they fed the photographs into their computer program  and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into    at their instructions  using standard software with slight modifications    a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces  and here's a little of that blown up. What you can see is there's about six different colors  and each color represents a type of wood to be cut  a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed  on a truck  and hand assembled in    hours by a team of eight people  only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune scape  coming up out of the courtyard  and there it is fully built. There are only    different pieces of wood  only    different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built in swimming pool  very  very cool. It's a great place for parties    it was  it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas  where lots of interesting things went on  all summer long. Now  lest you think that this is only for the light at heart  or just temporary installations  this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center  replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street  that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design  replace that bridge in six weeks  building it  including all of the parts  manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design  using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts  a couple of struts  like this  some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a    story building on the side of New York  using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self lit  you don't need any overhead lighting  so the neighbors don't complain about metal halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there  down the other side  and you get the same kind of grandeur. Now  let me show you  quickly  the opposite  if I may. Woo  pretty  huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City  whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics  who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution  it's to seduce you into something that you can do  into something that will please you  something that will lift your spirits  something that will make you feel as if are in another world    such as his Nobu restaurant in New York  which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.  When it's all said and done  it's got to look like seaweed   said the owner. Or his restaurant  Pod  in Philadelphia  Pennsylvania. I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this    I'm not touching any buttons  ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant  where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco  up on the Upper West Side  with this wall of cliff divers who    there you go  like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay  just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally  it's about comfort  it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside. In the Guardian Tower of New York  converted to a W Union Square    I'm sorry I'm rushing    where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy  fresh  soft  luscious  juicy  smooth  big and sweet wines  all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally  it's about entertainment  as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil  Orlando  Florida  where you're asked to enter the Greek theater  look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much. The Internet  the Web as we know it  the kind of Web    the things we're all talking about    is already less than       days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about  starting  say  with satellite images of the whole Earth  which we couldn't even imagine happening before  all these things rolling into our lives  just this abundance of things that are right before us  sitting in front of our laptop  or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing  and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. It's in       days  all this stuff has come. And I know that    years ago  if I had told you that this was all coming  you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free  you would say  this is simply    you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild eyed optimist. And yet it's here. The other thing that we know about it was that    years ago  as I looked at what even Wired was talking about  we thought it was going to be TV  but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all  it was impossible  and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning    if you think about  like  Wikipedia  it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory  but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible  I think one of the things that we're learning from this era  from this last decade  is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible  because we're unprepared for it. So  I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next       days. But if that's happened in the last       days  what's going to happen in the next       days  So  I have a kind of a simple story  and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making  this thing that has happened in       days    that's all these computers  all these handhelds  all these cell phones  all these laptops  all these servers    basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine  and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines  but that we're basically constructing a single  global machine. And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed  it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours  the number of days.       days without interruption    that's just unbelievable. And of course  the Internet is longer than just       days  the Web is only       days. So  I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine  And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a     billion clicks per day. And there's    trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions  and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan  the photographer  talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless  Well  here's a list of them. They're hard to tell  but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet  if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine  and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications  just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it      quadrillion transistors     trillion links  emails running at two megahertz itself     kilohertz text messaging      exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage  memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second  half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine. So I did something else. I figured out     billion clicks per day     trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation  we have these things    twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course  the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation  the size of this machine is the size    and its complexity  kind of    to your brain. Because in fact  that's how your brain works    in kind of the same way that the Web works. However  your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB  one human brain  if we look at the rate that this is increasing     years from now  there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year       the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity  in raw bits and stuff. And this is  I think  where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So  what about that  Well  here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say  three consequences of this. First  that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next       days    we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is  we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly  we're going to become completely codependent upon it. So let me go through those three things. First of all  we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices  but in fact  every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that    some people call this the cloud  and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways  all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple  and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine  you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing. And in some ways  it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything  all the cameras  and the microphones  and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with  say  phones. Right now  phones don't go through the Web  but they are beginning to  and they will. And if you imagine what  say  just as an example  what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs  Google Spreadsheets  blah  blah  blah    all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now  it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work  a Word document  they aren't on the Web  but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web  in some sense  is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item  every artifact that we make  will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web ness and connection  and it will be part of this machine  so that our environment    kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense    our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected. Now  with RFIDs and other things    whatever technology it is  it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine  and so we have  basically  an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels  and a car as a chip with wheels  because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it  and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied  alternative  virtual existence  and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact  what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two  where we embed the information  and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going    this union  this convergence of the atomic and the digital. And so one of the consequences of that  I believe  is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now    TV  film  video    that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses  they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media  such as the fact that copies have no value  the value's in the uncopiable things  the immediacy  the authentication  the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them  not so that they are  free  as in  beer   but  free  as in  freedom.  And the network effects rule  meaning that the more you have  the more you get. The first fax machine    the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot  because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist  recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency. So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying   Machines are the extensions of the human senses.  And I'm saying   Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine   in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes  and ears  and touches  through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr  or Photosynth  this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense  the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras. Now  the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring  that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you  that what we'll talk about is    I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing  which is a  semantic Web.  So first of all  the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net  that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that  where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember  it was a kind of green screen with cursors  and there was really not much to do  and if you wanted to connect it  you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was    if you wanted to participate in this  you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line  you had to share packets. The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one  if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page  I went from my computer  to an FTP site  to another airline computer. Now we have pages    the unit has been resolved into pages  so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight  I go into the airline's flight page  the website of the airline  and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links  so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny    if someone wanted to link to you  you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing. We're now entering to the third stage  which is what I'm talking about  and that is where we link the data. So  I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine  from page to page  and now data to data. So the difference is  is that rather than linking from page to page  we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea  rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported    or every item  or every noun    is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items  or ideas  or words  if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual  it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person  so every person will have a unique ID. Every person  every item will have a something that will be very specific  and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now  in this new one  when I link to it  I would link to my particular flight  my particular seat. And so  giving an example of this thing  I live in Pacifica  rather than    right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town  and that it's a specific town that I live in  but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to    it will know  the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place  and that whenever it sees that word   Pacifica   it knows that it actually has a place  latitude  longitude  a certain population. So here are some of the technical terms  all three letter things  that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there  you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that  You should just do that once  and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want  is all your friends are identified  and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed  and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into    where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web  Web  .   giant global graph    we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared  which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page  or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages  they are things. Everything we've described  every artifact or place  will be a specific representation  will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to  that we won't see in the next    years  or       days  but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things    where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane    that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked  down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has. So  the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there  and the closer it is  the better. If you allow Google to  it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at    o'clock in the morning. So I am open  and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization  you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number  I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things    I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first  saying   Oh  that's awful.  But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology  called the alphabet  and writing  we're totally dependent on it  and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way  we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI  but it's not the AI in conscious AI  as being an expert  Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do  and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling  who's searching who  It goes both ways. So we are the Web  that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next       days  it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next       days  it's not just going to be the Web but only better    it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there  that's not  again  conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing  in a good sense. Secondly  it's become much more personalized. It will know us  and that's good. And again  the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly  it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment  and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that. So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just  the Web  only better   but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing  it is a very big machine  very reliable machine  more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system  more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a  One.  And I don't know what else to call it  than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again  I don't want to talk about consciousness  I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria  or a volvox  which is what that organism is. So  to do  action  take away. So  here's what I would say  there's only one machine  and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time. I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra  and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory  the RAM and the ALU  the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself  this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system. But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced  they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote  actually  from Alan Turing   In    years  it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.  This was in     . And now  in       it's still not true. And so  the question is  why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain  What people didn't realize  and I'm just beginning to realize right now  is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene  the fastest computer in the world. It's got         processors  they can basically process    quadrillion bits of information per second. That's    to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great  if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States  if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States  you get       households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses. Now  let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of  actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI  and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. So that's true love  right there. Now  how much computation does the brain do  I estimate    to the    bits per second  which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is  how much    they are doing a similar amount of processing  similar amount of data    the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use  And it's actually as much as your laptop computer  it's just    watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by       houses  the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop. So the question is  how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency  And let me just summarize. So the bottom line  the brain processes information using         times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this  Let's just take a look about how the brain works  and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So  this clip is from the PBS series   The Secret Life of the Brain.  It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other  and where they contact each other  those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other    about     million of them  sending about    quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. How does that compare with the way computers work  In the computer  you have all the data going through the central processing unit  and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck  whereas in the brain  what you have is these neurons  and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures  these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid    it's like cars on a freeway  everything has to happen in lockstep    whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive. So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno   the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.  Brian actually said this in     . And nobody was listening then  but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing  technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. This is    it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers  and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here  called the gate  controls the flow of current from the source to the drain    these two electrodes. And that current  electrical current  is carried by electrons  just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is  when you actually turn on the gate  you get an increase in the amount of current  and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate  there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one  and the absence of current to represent a zero. Now  what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller  they no longer behave like this. In fact  they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute  which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean  neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now  this pore can open and close. But  when it's open  because these ions have to line up and flow through  one at a time  you get a kind of sporadic  not steady    it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore    which neurons can do  they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity    even when it's closed  because these ions are so small  they can actually sneak through  a few can sneak through at a time. So  what you have is that when the pore is open  you get some current sometimes. These are your ones  but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed  you have a zero  but you have a few ones thrown in. Now  this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that  right now  in         the technology that we are using    a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously  side by side. In fact  there's about    electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about    ion channels in parallel. Now  in a few years time  by       we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them    before  it was    . Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen  and technology has really benefitted from that. But what's happening now is that in       the transistor is going to become so small  that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel  and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random  even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up  and that's going to crash your machine. So  we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing    the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain. OK  so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory  it sends it into the processor or the ALU  and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work  I told you all  you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity  just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern. What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered  it doesn't show up over here  these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero  and it doesn't show up  there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle  because each of these steps has to be flawless  otherwise you lose that data  whereas in the brain  you have a system that stores data in a distributed way  and it's robust. What I want to basically talk about is my dream  which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina  which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code  like you do in a computer. In fact  the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information    they just want to send the changes  what's new in the image  and so on    and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve  to send to the rest of the brain. Instead of doing this in software  or doing those kinds of algorithms  we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells  and they figured out the network  and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip  and the connections among the neurons are represented  actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described. Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip    I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul  who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see  OK  because it's putting out different kinds of information  it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast  which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast  which will show up on the video as green. This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right  you will see this blue activity there  it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image  that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity  which represents regions where contrast is decreasing  it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information    your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it  and         of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve. What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse  right  It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background  only on the edges  and then in the hair  and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send  they want to make it very sparse  because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing  and it's doing it just with the circuitry  and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there  which we've captured on the chip. But the point that I want to make    I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones  but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image  so  you know  you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so  here you go. Yes  so that's the idea. When you stand still  you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth  the retina picks up these changes. And that's why  you know  when you're sitting here and something happens in your background  you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you. Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano  OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified  and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer  and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought  imagination  be creative and things like that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Question for you  Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing  the future of Africa  this conference    what connections can we make  if any  between them  Kwabena Boahen  Yes  like I said at the beginning  I got my first computer when I was a teenager  growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force  it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction  if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction  hearing about RD D   whatever it was called  and just    you know  buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective  where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective  and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see  use that infusion  to come up with new things  because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else. CA  Thanks Kwabena  that was really interesting. Thank you. My talk is  Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes.  And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another  but I hope by the end of these    minutes  you'll see a little bit of a relation. It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami  Most people think they know what origami is. It's this  flapping birds  toys  cootie catchers  that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form  a form of sculpture. The common theme    what makes it origami    is folding is how we create the form. You know  it's very old. This is a plate from     . It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close  it's this shape  called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years  and you would think something that's been around that long    so restrictive  folding only    everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case. But in the twentieth century  a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along  and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly  he created a language  a way we could communicate  a code of dots  dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk  we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection  and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure    one sheet  no cuts  folding only  hundreds of folds. This  too  is origami  and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns  antlers    even  if you look close  cloven hooves. And it raises a question  what changed  And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art  which is math. That is  people applied mathematical principles to the art  to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields    and in origami    is letting dead people do your work for you. Because what you can do is take your problem  and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved  and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple  easy to understand. The first law is two colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex    the number of mountain folds  the number of valley folds    always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold  you find that if you number the angles in a circle  all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line  all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack  you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets  a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that. And you'd think   Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity   But indeed  the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin  and yet they govern all of chemistry  all of life  all of history. If we obey these laws  we can do amazing things. So in origami  to obey these laws  we can take simple patterns    like this repeating pattern of folds  called textures    and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami  we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very  very simple  but when we put it together  we get something a little different. This fish      scales    again  it is one uncut square  only folding. And if you don't want to fold     scales  you can back off and just do a few things  and add plates to the back of a turtle  or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to    stars on a flag  with    stripes. And if you want to go really crazy        scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs  so take a look if you get a chance. The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea  combine it with a square  and you get an origami figure. What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say   Can you really be that specific  I mean  a stag beetle    it's got two points for jaws  it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail   And yeah  you really can. So how do we do that  Well  we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form  It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure  I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject  a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base  you can make the legs narrower  you can bend them  you can turn it into the finished shape. Now the first step  pretty easy. Take an idea  draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard  but that middle step    going from the abstract description to the folded shape    that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap  Take a square. Fold it in half  fold it in half  fold it again  until it gets long and narrow  and then we'll say at the end of that  that's a flap. I could use that for a leg  an arm  anything like that. What paper went into that flap  Well  if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern  you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap  and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well  there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier  I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible  I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there  it needs a quarter circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge  it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle  it uses a full circle. So  no matter how I make a flap  it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps  What do I need  I need a lot of circles. And in the     s  origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out  because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles  you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape    in this case  a cockroach. And it's so simple. It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say   Well  you know  how simple is that   But computers    you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms  and with this  we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker  and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms    even Windows. And you just draw a stick figure  and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing  calculates the crease pattern  and if you use that stick figure that I just showed    which you can kind of tell  it's a deer  it's got antlers    you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern  you fold on the dotted lines  you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer  with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer  not a white tailed deer  but you want a mule deer  or an elk  you change the packing  and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or  really  any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects  spiders  which are close  things with legs  things with legs and wings  things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough  then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it  Snack Time.  And you can do more than just insects. This    you can put details  toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually  lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme  because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square  the bass player from a single square. And if you say   Well  but the guitar  bass    that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.  Well  then you could do an organ. And what this has allowed is the creation of origami on demand. So now people can say   I want exactly this and this and this   and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art  and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here  except the car  is origami. Just to show you  this really was folded paper. Computers made things move  but these were all real  folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals  but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly  origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine  in science  in space  in the body  consumer electronics and more. And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern  this folded pattern  studied by Koryo Miura  a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern  and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition  but it flew in a Japanese telescope in     . Now  there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope  but it's very simple. The telescope  going up in space  it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern    you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists. But if you want to go higher and go larger than this  then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit        miles up      meter diameter lens. So  imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this  planetary scientists  who want to look up  and then other people  who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down  how do you get it up in space  You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller  Well  about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model. Folded lens  you divide up the panels  you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something     meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers  wanting to make use of the work of dead people  or perhaps live origamists  said   Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.  So they looked into the origami community  we got in touch with them  and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size  but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat  compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation  which was not     meters    it was a five meter. But this is a five meter telescope    has about a quarter mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range  and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle. Now  there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace  Exploration  Agency flew a solar sail  and you can see here that the sail expands out  and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet like at its destination  but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space  or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination  but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there  through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern  based on a model called the water bomb base. Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how  in a computer  to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming  and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out  does it work  And that leads to a really interesting idea. You know  where did these things come from  Well  the heart stent came from that little blow up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern  called the water bomb base. The airbag flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects    things with legs. The thing is  that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved  problems that you solve for aesthetic value only  or to create something beautiful  turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound  origami may someday even save a life. Thanks. As a particle physicist  I study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level. For most of my research career  I've been using accelerators  such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University  just up the road  to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently  I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because  as I'll explain to you  the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty first century view of the universe  what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are    at least some of the big questions. So  recently  we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe    and by ordinary matter  I mean you  me  the planets  the stars  the galaxies    the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter  or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe  is stuff that's invisible. By invisible  I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum  which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there  We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact  this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale  and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that. What about the rest of the pie  The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later  OK. So for now  let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies  especially in a spiral galaxy like this  most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine  even if you know physics  this should be intuitive  OK    that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here  OK. So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars  that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words  if we measured speed as a function of distance    this is the only time I'm going to show a graph  OK    we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made  instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant  as a function of distance. If it's constant  that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact  this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves  and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that  but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy. Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space  they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very  actually  famous cluster  the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white  fuzzy  elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters    we take a snapshot now  we take a snapshot in a decade  it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster  OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies  their orbital velocities  and figure out how much mass is in this cluster. And again  what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum  we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster  as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact  there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter  OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big  blue blob on there  OK  to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually  Yes  we can. And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer  it could be an eye  it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy  A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now  how do we deduce where the galaxy is  Well  we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye  right  We say  the ray of light came this way  the galaxy must be there  OK. Now  suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies    and don't forget the dark matter  OK. Now  if we consider a different ray of light  one going off like this  we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field  due to mass  will deflect not only the trajectory of particles  but will deflect light itself. So this light ray will not continue in a straight line  but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy  You can respond. Up  right  We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy  Yes  great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down  be bent up into the observer's eye  and the observer sees a ray of light here. Now  take into account the fact that we live in a three dimensional universe  OK  a three dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye  Yes  The rays would lie on a    I'd like to see    yeah  on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light    rays of light on a cone    that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye  what do I see  A circle  a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that  OK. Now  it will only be a perfect ring if the source  the deflector and the eyeball  in this case  are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed  we'll see a different image. Now  you can do an experiment tonight over the reception  OK  to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise  that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so  this is your instrument  OK. But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate  OK. So  actually  at home  whenever we break a wineglass  I save the bottom  take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off  and I have a little gravitational lens  OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper    I'm a physicist.  Laughter  So  a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy  and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring  an Einstein ring. Now  move the base off to the side  and the ring will split up into arcs  OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper  you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again  this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing. OK  so the question is  do we see this in the sky  Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at  say  a cluster of galaxies  And the answer is yes. And so  here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well  first of all  for the golden shape galaxies    those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions  or mirages  practically  of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see  all these streaks  are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away. So what we can do  then  is based on how much distortion we see in those images  we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also  you can tell by eye  by looking at this  that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure  and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded  OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye. OK  so  a quick review then  to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter    this gravitationally attracting stuff    is that galaxies  the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large  it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects  these distortions that say that  again  clusters are embedded in dark matter. OK. So now  let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy  we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe    and so I've put down four spiral galaxies  OK    and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures  so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure  horizontal or vertical  for measuring where things are. If you could do this  what you would find that with each passing day  each passing year  each passing billions of years  OK  the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger  OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart. Now  what Stephen Hawking mentioned  as well  is that after the Big Bang  space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space  it tends to slow down the expansion of the space  OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So  in the last century  OK  people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever  whether it would slow down  you know  will be slowing down  but continue forever  slow down and stop  asymptotically stop  or slow down  stop  and then reverse  so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago  two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down  OK. By how much less is it expanding today  compared to  say  a couple of billion years ago  The startling answer to this question  OK  from these experiments  was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago  OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen  OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out  in the mathematics  you can put it in as a term that's an energy  but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy  and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point  OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in. Now  so at this point  then  what I want to really emphasize to you  is that  first of all  dark matter and dark energy are completely different things  OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe  and they have very different effects. Dark matter  because it gravitationally attracts  it tends to encourage the growth of structure  OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form  because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy  on the other hand  is putting more and more space between the galaxies  makes it  the gravitational attraction between them decrease  and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies  and how they    their number density  how many there are as a function of time    we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming. In terms of dark matter  I said that we don't have any  you know  really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter  And the answer is yes. We have well motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now  what do I mean by well motivated  I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon  OK  things that I haven't even talked about  that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting  new particle. So  this is exactly what you want in physics  where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate  OK. One or both  who knows  Or it could be something completely different. Now  we look for these dark matter particles because  after all  they are here in the room  OK  and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building  through the Earth    they're so non interacting. So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota  OK  deep under the ground  and in fact  in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything  OK  but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy  to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider  a particle physics accelerator  that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider. Now  because they are so non interactive  they will actually escape the detector  so their signature will be missing energy  OK. Now  unfortunately  there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy  so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally  for future endeavors  there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy    ground based telescopes  and there are three space based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions  what is dark matter  What is dark energy  The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions  which I very much look forward to addressing over the next    hours  while I'm here. Thank you. Jambo  bonjour  zdravstvujtye  dayo  these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks  as I've been to    countries I think I'm up to  on this crazy tour I've been doing  checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places  places like Mongolia  Cambodia  New Guinea  South Africa  Tanzania twice    I was here a month ago. And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing  for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that  the kind of surface thing that you take away from it  is not that we're all one  although I'm going to tell you about that  but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe.       different languages spoken by six and a half billion people  all different colors  shapes  sizes. You walk down the street in any big city  you travel like that  and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species. How do we explain that diversity  Well  that's what I'm going to talk about today  is how we're using the tools of genetics  population genetics in particular  to tell us how we generated this diversity  and how long it took. Now  the problem of human diversity  like all big scientific questions    how do you explain something like that    can be broken down into sub questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub questions. First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin  in fact  And given that we do    and that's the assumption everybody  I think  in this room would make    when was that  When did we originate as a species  How long have we been divergent from each other  And the second question is related  but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source  how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe  and in the process generate all of this diversity  the different ways of life  the different appearances  the different languages around the world  Well  the question of origins  as with so many other questions in biology  seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In  The Descent of Man   he wrote   In each great region of the world  the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee  and as these two species are now man's nearest allies  it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.  So we're done  we can go home    finished the origin question. Well  not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry  our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around    million years ago  they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time  due to the vagaries of plate tectonics  floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around    million years ago  and then we had the first African exodus  as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia  became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas  the chimpanzees and us. So  yes  if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes  it's very clear  by looking at the fossil record  we started off here. But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry  things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder  you wouldn't leap back  like that. What about our human ancestry  Because if we go far enough back  we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together  so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms  if you go far enough back    over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that  Well  historically  it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground  and largely on the basis of morphology    the way things are shaped  often skull shape    saying   This looks a little bit more like us than that  so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.  The field of paleoanthropology  I'll argue  gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry  but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that  You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids  potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge  by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right  we've got Homo erectus  Homo habilis  and Australopithecus    now called Paranthropus boisei  the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species  same place  same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to  Possibilities about our ancestry  but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. Well  a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently    again  largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus  Carl von Linne  a Swedish botanist  who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job  And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about        species in  Systema Naturae.  He actually coined the term Homo sapiens    it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans  he said   Well  you know  we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories.  And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans  and a blatantly racist category he termed  Monstrosus   which basically included all the people he didn't like  including imaginary folk like elves. It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre Darwinian era. Except  if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as    or    years ago  in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of        years ago    Carlton Coon is the best example    had been diverging from each other    this was in the post Darwinian era    for over a million years  since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data  Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork. Well  what I'm going to talk about today  what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry  digging things up out of the ground  possible ancestors  and saying it on the basis of morphology    which we still don't completely understand  we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation    what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem  or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you    anybody have a member of the family  or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree  trace back in time  You start in the present  with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings  you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past  adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually  no matter how good you are at digging up the church records  and all that stuff  you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors  and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance. Who were these people who came before  We have no written record. Well  actually  we do. Written in our DNA  in our genetic code    we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study. Now  a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long  linear molecule  a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits  A  C  G and T  we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it  Well  it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome    we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes    a haploid genome is around  .  billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing  if you add it all together  is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body  and stretch it end to end  it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body  and you stretch it end to end  it would reach from here to the moon and back  thousands of times. It's a lot of information. And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on  it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of   War and Peace.  Now multiply it by    . And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night  and you're very  very careful  and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention  but  occasionally  when you're copying this by hand  you're going to make a little typo  a spelling mistake    substitute an I for an E  or a C for a T. Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen  and these changes get transmitted down through the generations  they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone  it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past  the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation  the pattern of these markers in people all over the world  and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history  that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today. These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA  tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother  and your mother's mother  all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome  the piece of DNA that makes men men  traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room  everybody in the world  falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now  even though these are simplified versions of the real trees  they're still kind of complicated  so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides  combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take home message  Well  the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa  among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past  a sub group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. Now  how recently do we share this ancestry  Was it millions of years ago  which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world  No  the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last         years  we all share an ancestor  a single person    Mitochondrial Eve  you might have heard about her    in Africa  an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y chromosome side  the male side of the story  the Y chromosome Adam only lived around        years ago. That's only about       human generations  the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last        years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family. Now  that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier  Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species  or sub species rather  human races around the world  Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently  Well  that's a big question. These  why  questions  particularly in genetics and the study of history in general  are always the big ones  the ones that are tough to answer. And so when all else fails  talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around        years ago  Well  we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly         years ago. It went up and down  and it really started to accelerate around        years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types  oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around        years ago  but basically  from        years on  things were getting really tough  getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City  Chicago  Seattle  all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain  all of Scandinavia  covered by ice several kilometers thick. Now  Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet    about    percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn    and there aren't a lot of glaciers here  except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here  We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather  Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo climatological map of what Africa looked like between        and        years ago  reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica  it's technically a desert  it gets so little precipitation. So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets  compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time  roughly        years ago  crashed to fewer than       individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa  from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals  our distant cousins  not our direct ancestors  living in Europe  and they date from around        or        years ago. Now  at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience  basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around        to        years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period. But then            thousand years ago  somewhere in that region  all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species  at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably  according to what many linguists believe  fully modern language  syntactic language    subject  verb  object    that we use to convey complex ideas  like I'm doing now  appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded. This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa  and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well  you want the ultimate African success story  Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa    probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now  around        thousand years ago    allowing us not only to survive in Africa  but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia  leaving Africa around        years ago  reaching Australia very rapidly  by        years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters. So those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours  you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals  hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs  moving up  following the grasslands into the Middle East around        years ago  during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward  following the grasslands  because that's what they were adapted to live on. And when they reached Central Asia  they reached what was effectively a steppe super highway  a grassland super highway. The grasslands at that time    this was during the last ice age    stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea  and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around        years ago  and finally  a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable  Siberia  inside the Arctic Circle  during the last ice age    temperature was at           even       perhaps    migrating into the Americas  ultimately reaching that final frontier. An amazing story  and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that  the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us  allowing us to create novel cultures  allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. Now  that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world  the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book   The Journey of Man   and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film    it was co produced with National Geographic    I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film  but they said   You know  we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins  where we all came from  using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know  the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA  and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next   Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic. And I said   Well  you know  what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from  you know  a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers  and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more    hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.  And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April     . It has three core components. Obviously  science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to  Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results. That's the focus of the field research  the centers that we've set up all over the world       of them  top population geneticists. But  in addition  we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project  The Human Genome Project  or a Mars Rover mission. In this case  you actually can. You can go onto our website  Nationalgeographic.com genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database  and tell us a little about your genealogical background  have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort. Now  this is all a nonprofit enterprise  and so the money that we raise  after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components  gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity  basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational  cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects  and I'll show you a couple of examples. So how are we doing on the project  We've got about        samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public          people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago  which has raised around five million dollars  the majority of which  at least half  is going back into the Legacy Fund. We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around         dollars. Projects around the world    documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone  preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza  language revitalization in Tajikistan  etc.  etc. So the project is going very  very well  and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. Thank you very much. Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic  an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic  and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh  the wrath of Photoshop. This is a jet landing at San Francisco  by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy  by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC  by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic  by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth    they're not very good swimmers    and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa  photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down  so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas  by William Albert Allard  a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall  making her own special connection  photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain  photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But  hey  at least it's hygienic. These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance  by David Doubilet. And this is a comet  captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally  the bow of the Titanic  without movie stars  photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated  media world  because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment. Here's an example. Four years ago  I was at the beach with my son  and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment  and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see  as I go tearing into the water after him  the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out  and I can see his face in terror  looking at me  saying   Help me  Dad.  I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore  he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory  as it's called  is when all the elements came together to define not just the event  but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer. Now I have to tell you  I was talking to Kyle last week about this  that I was going to tell this story. And he said   Oh  yeah  I remember that too  I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.  I thought I was a hero. So  this represents    this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists  working at the very top of their craft    except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year  and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year  we added a section to our website called  Your Shot   where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success  tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can  at times  be amazing. And seeing this reinforces  for me  that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them. But to be a great photojournalist  you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly  you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography. Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad  called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species  of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did  up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture  shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across  and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick    the camera  again  an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. A lion having a late night snack    notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail. But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight  something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick  along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay  collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie  and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park  because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began  the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park. And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers  who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking  after weeks of moving back and forth  in and out of the park  came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed  along with    members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory  because they couldn't leave it there  because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight   Isn't this an amazing world   And instead  created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park  he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants  the rangers and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts. Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history  more people live in urban  rather than rural  environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities  but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen  a very energetic photographer  came to me and said   We need to document this  and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.  And I said   Well  you know  that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.  So instead  what we did was we decided to  instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story    where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything    we put Jonas into Dharavi  which is part of Mumbai  India  and let him stay there  and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place  Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way. Sometimes  though  the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject  but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here  in a photo by Brian  a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch  the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here  Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom. Back on land  Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa  where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals  the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China  Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted  the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain. But there are also glimmers of hope  and I think anytime we're doing a big  big story on this  we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand  where commercial fishing had been banned    the result being that the overfished species have been restored  and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries. Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey  who was honored at last year's TED  took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home  on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here  a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest  as a reminder of home. From here  the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany  where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals  such as here in Walter Reed. And finally  often fitted with high tech prosthesis  they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply. Now  these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are  when it comes down to it  just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed  partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact  a year earlier  a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now  what leopard seals do mostly is  they eat penguins. You know of  The March of the Penguins.  This is sort of the munch of the penguins. Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out. But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well  this one female came up to him. She's probably    it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph  but she's    feet long. So  she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid  because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior  on the right  was really her way of saying to him   Hey  look how big I am   Or you know   My  what big teeth you have.  Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her  here was this big  goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him  alive  and put them in front of him. She dropped them off  and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him  like  What are you doing   Go back and get them  and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days  until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. Eventually  though  Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out  you know  snorting out in disgust. And lost interest with him  and went back to what she does best. Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature  and came back with not just a collection of photographs  but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories  ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people  and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you. My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts    it's  of course  nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point  to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So  first  we violate the common sense  the logic. All of you  if you hold your hand like this     degrees    all of you. Not you. All of you  right  Palm up. If you do this  the common  the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree  Good. But I will first teach you a method  how you can do it without moving the wrist  and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately  right  Hold the hand like this  palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is    I doesn't speak very many  but I do the best  what I are. Right molded you say  with iron  That was a joke  actually  and I    OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. Forward  don't move the wrist. Up  don't move the wrist. Over the heart  don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now    logic  logically  you have got to this position from this  without moving the wrist. Now  the shortcut. But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here  palm down  you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah   Laughter  One move. OK. So  that was the warming up. Now  I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before  Zoe. She has left. No  A big hand. Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water  right  And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about    cheers. Beer has about    there's a lot of water in beer. So  now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing  control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it  quick. I work with precision    oh  sorry    control and a very powerful ... memory system  right  So  if    I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially  I don't gamble but ... So  if we are    if we have five person  and I will do a five handed poker game. Now I will interact. So a different person all the time  so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand  Which number  One  two  three  four or five   Audience  Three.  Lennart Green  Three    good. And here  I had a mat here to make it a little    the critical moment is    sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together  immediately when he    before he deals the card. Now  so I think  number three  I have arranged them in a full house. With queens and    it's OK    queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One  two  three  four  five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. But also the other hand is good  if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand    three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind  or deuce    deuce. No reaction  That with even    OK  and this. These look in order  I'm probably    hopefully    yeah. Three  four  five  six  seven and ... But  of course  I will have the winning hand. Ten  jack  queen  king  ace. Yeah. So  good. So the hand that looks so good from the beginning  number three  at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right  So  please mix them. Now  if you are interested  I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes  I work with kind of estimation  shuffle tracking    ah  good. Impressive. Thank you. So  first  the first term is estimation. Here  I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course  I can count the cards  but this is much quicker. Right  You agree. So here I have  actually    I know exactly where the cards are. So here  I can make a bet  and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here      jack  queen  king  ace. OK. Next is a term    I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here  I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop  when I point to them  right. Point  say stop. Zoe  Stop. LG  Here    you see some are missing  And that's the stealing cards  which I did. OK. Now  another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards  even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So    because if you look  now  I can still see it. You agree  But if you square    square  and shuffle  and then a cut. So here  to follow my cards  I must look at the shuffle from the begin    ah  we are started together. It's OK  it's OK. Come to    no  no  no  no. I'm joking  yeah  Any style    yeah  good. Here I have to calculate  but actually  I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain  you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain  that's much better. And so    Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with  in the right atmosphere  with humor  you have    that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge  where you can find any solution of any problem. OK. Now  I drop the cards  and you say stop anyway  right  Not at the last card. Zoe  Stop. LG  Yeah. When I'm sober  I do this much quicker  but we will check. Ah  not in order  it    that was a mistake. No  I'm kidding. No  now and then I put in a mistake  just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right  Yeah  last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So  this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called  Bicycle.  And this deck is very flexible  but not so many people know  if you check  if you press at the right spots  you see how thin and flexible this deck is  right  Now  you can carry this in your wallet  so ... You don't see it  make no reaction  So  but here  and    is the camera getting too much  No. Yeah   Audience  It's getting too much.  LG  Pardon  But then  when we will have it back  you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here  please. If you push these heaps    everyone see    push them together so they are really interlaced  right  Yeah  good. Perfect. Just push them through  good. Thank you. And then  I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite  stealen    stolen  probably copied from America but we will see. Here    shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old  right  But you know  I think you are familiar with fractals    the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way  and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate  then you go to    then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah  great. I think I have it. So now  different persons  older  tap. Please name any card  anyone. Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number    from the top. One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine            . Yes  right. So    oh  jack of spades. You said spades   Audience  Yes.  LG  Ah. My fault. Don't applaud  this was clubs. So  jack of spades. I think ...           sorry    . One  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine                                                            ah      yes. It's the last. Now  I do it quicker  better. OK. Another person. Oh  I forgot  I shouldn't shuffle but I think       actually  my technique is to peek  all the time. When I lift the heap  I peek. You see  yeah  perfect. Three  four  five  six. Then I calculate    yeah  good. Another person  another card.  Audience  Seven of diamonds.  LG  Seven of diamonds. Perfect  my favorite  yeah  seven. So I will do it quick  very quick  but in slow motion  so you can follow. Seven of   Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  good. I start here. Good  thank you. The thing I did    I peeked. I know where the card were  then I chose it. So another person  another card. Another person. LG  Pardon  LG  Ten of diamonds  yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to  so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed  right  Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut  Lift. Excellent. So  thank you. Another person  another card. LG  Pardon   Audience  Five of clubs.  LG  Five of clubs. It's not the same person  even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now  I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop  anywhere. Got it  Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes  that's difficult to find a card here. We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop  when the cards are in the air  right  LG  Very good. OK. OK  I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs. Excellent. I love that card. Here  I will do the most difficult thing. For example  you are sitting in Las Vegas  and you're betting  and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel  it's just the regular  one card. And now  when I lift this card  it shall be your card. What was your card  LG  Queen of  Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge  right  So here  I grab    you know this  Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes  This is a tough one  because here I must take advantage of    I switch it with the five of clubs. So  now a false count. Which card shall I use  Queen or five  Zoe  The queen. LG  Queen  yes. So  I use the queen  and here's five of clubs. The false count    and the number one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight    you say the same card all the time. Eight  nine    . This is a kind of optical deal  right  When I put one card at a table    look  it's not one card. It's    look  it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here  yes. Now  to the satellites things. This    oh sorry  don't look at the beam. My fault. This is high frequency laser  and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right  sorry  my    I should have mentioned that  yeah. But you can relax  because it takes half an hour before it works  so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. Now  I put the laser here  and    now  when I deal the cards in the laser  I know where they are but    yes  Did the camera got it  No  They didn't  What happened  LG  OK  I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now  No   Audience  No  they're all gone.  LG  But you see the hand. Ah  good  good  good. But now. So now  that was the reason  right  You see the cards  Yes. Yeah  good. Now       one guy laughed. So now  to find the queen  do it this way  take back the other one  take back the queen. Yeah  interesting  but a little dangerous. I liked it. Now  a little more difficult. Name    anyone  name  please  any suit. So here  here I have to peek  lots of cards. I think there are lots of    I don't know how many    but        spades in a deck  at least  right  So every time I lift the heap  I peek  right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect  excellent. So I start with the ace    yeah  ace. Ah  yeah    spades  Same mistake as before  right  So    I arrange the spades    the clubs. I try to do this right here. First  I take the spades. You see  I don't work with prestige  so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then  I get some extra sympathy points  right  One  two  three  four    yes  the camera got it  Five  six  seven  eight    ah    nine      the jack  jack of spades  queen of    I like that laugh  yeah  Good. Queen. Wait  wait  wait    please take any card. Grab any one. Quick  quick  good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now  look  ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades  correct  Yeah  OK. Now  a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already  so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit  please. LG  It was after the blindfold. I like this guy  yeah. OK. That should be my end effect  but OK. Armani    who said Armani  You  I drop the cards and you    which size  Which size  It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size  Say stop.  Audience  Stop.  LG  Yeah  Armani. OK. Ah  this is tough. OK  a suit. I had clubs before  spades. Another suit.  Audience  Diamonds.  LG  Diamonds  perfect. So  in this case  I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards  and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up  like this  you reverse it. Zoe  OK. LG  OK  now. Do with both hands  and quick. Yes  good  good. I think we have it now. Yeah  good  good. So here  diamonds  hearts    no  diamonds. Good  good. Stop. Do you see the pattern  No  Now  Yes  yes  OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry  I dropped one. Maybe it's important    yeah    nine of diamonds  OK. So now    I always ask  why do I put myself in this position  I have to figure out so many outs  when I miss some cards  but I love it. So now  I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds  but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away  right  I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance  it works immediately. Aargh  Duct tape. I look    shake the cards  so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah  good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was    did you hear  It was women's voice. Hear the guy    yeah  more  more  more. Yeah  good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too  because some guys think       some guys think I can peek through the nostril  so do more. Go  go. Right  Good. Satisfied  Looks good  like Batman. Ow  No  with dignity and elegance  right  But I like her  yeah. I said  be a little tough. And it was OK. One more  The last. OK. All right. Now you must agree that I'm    I must rely on other senses  right  I work with vibration. So  what was the card  Diamonds. Ah  I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds    I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding  warming up    king of hearts. And I give you a diamonds  so they    so you put them here  in a nice row  right. And you can see  yeah  Good. Ace of diamonds  yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Good. Good. Two     Applause     thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two  but the wrong color. Spades  sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after  so let the skepticals here  in this  examine them  right  Remind me. It's a gift. Two    and it was two of spades  right  Sorry  two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three    three of diamonds. Yes  Four    I like challenges  yes. Yeah  good. Chris Anderson  You're peeking. LG  Pardon  CA  You're peeking. You just got to    this is a request from the lady in the back. Okay. Try that. LG  Yeah. Also listen. OK  now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes  Good  OK. So  how many cards  Five  Zoe  Four. LG  Four. Is five the next card  Zoe  Five of diamonds  yeah. LG  It's not here  Zoe  It's not there. LG  Oh. So here  all the cards are face down    you agree   Audience  Yes.  LG  Yes  You see that in the screen  And this is face up  and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be    was it five  Zoe  Five. LG  Yeah    I will reverse it face up here. Yes  Zoe  Yeah. LG  Six    six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah  I do this. I know where it is  because I peeked before and then I do this. Right  Eight. If    and then nine  right  Yeah. Yesterday    the day before yesterday  I was in Vegas  and I used this actually. Nine  Yeah  Correct  No  Yes  Ah  good  good. Ten    once again  I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack    you  unclear  with Jack  Jack of diamonds  correct   Audience  No.  LG  Yes  And queen  Queen  with misdirection. Misdirection.  Applause  Yeah  And then  king  after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One  two  three  four    mmm  Check it. Yes  CA  King of diamonds. LG  Ah  Good. Oh. Touch me  feel    ah  ah  you know  CA  Ladies and gentlemen  Lennart Green  LG  Okay  thank you. Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other  chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training  that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park  and the owner is calling it  and the owner says  you know   Puppy  come here  come here   and the dog thinks   Hmm  interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end  the owner's calling.  It's a difficult choice  right  Rear end  owner. Rear end wins. I mean  you lose. You cannot compete with the environment  if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So  when we train  we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view. Now  I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that    on one side  we have people who think that you train a dog  number one  by making up rules  human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says   You're going to act this way  damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will  to bend to our will.  Then  number two  we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three  now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy  he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy  he puts his paws on your leg    you know  isn't that nice  And you go   Oh  there's a good boy.  You bend down  you pat him    you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff  and a few months later  he weighs  you know     pounds. Every time he jumps up  he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean  it is really very  very scary the abuse that dogs get. So  this whole dominance issue    number one  what we get in dog training is this Mickey Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy  because it prevents physical fights. Of course  female dogs  bitches  on the other hand  have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is   I have it  you don't.  And what you will find is a very  very low ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male. So  we get in dog training this notion of dominances  or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this. Dogs get so abused. Dogs  horses and humans    these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior    is to always come back and apologize. Like   Oh  I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry  yes  it's my fault.  They are just so beatable  and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up  you open the dog book  what does it say   Hold his front paws  squeeze his front paws  stamp on his hind feet  squirt him in the face with lemon juice  hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper  knee him in the chest  flip him over backwards.  Because he grew  And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do  This is insanity. I ask owners   Well  how would you like the dog to greet you   And people say   Well  I don't know  to sit  I guess.  I said   Let's teach him to sit.  And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say   Laytay chai  paisey  paisey.  Go on  something should happen now. Why aren't you responding  Oh  you don't speak Swahili. Well  I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English  or American  or Spanish  or French. So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL  English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand  and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food    she's a great trainer  much better than I am. I don't need food  but the average owner says   Puppy  sit.  Or they go   Sit  sit  sit.  They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason  like the dog has a third eye there    it's insane. You know   Sit  sit.  No  we go   Puppy  sit     boom  it's got it in six to    trials. Then we phase out the food as a lure  and now the dog knows that  sit  means sit  and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence.  Phoenix  come here  take this  and go to Jamie  please.  And I've taught her  Phoenix    come here    take this    go to  and the name of my son   Jamie.  And the dog can take a note  and I've got my own little search and rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is  you know  wherever kids are  crushing rocks by a stream or something  and take him a little message that says   Hey  dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.  So  at this point  the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it  Not necessarily  no. As I said  if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff  why come to the owner  The dog lives with you  the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt  if you like  when he wants to. At the moment  he's in the park  and you are competing with smells  and other dogs  and squirrels. So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do  and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically  we follow a low frequency behavior    one the dog doesn't want to do    by a high frequency behavior  commonly known as a behavior problem  or a dog hobby    something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower frequency behavior. So we go   sit   on the couch   sit   tummy rub   sit   look  I throw a tennis ball   sit   say hello to that other dog. Yes  we put  sniff butt  on queue.  Sit   sniff butt. So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing  in essence  is we're teaching the dog  kind of like    we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog  you know  speaking through the fence to  say  an Akita  saying   Wow  my owners  they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit  and they do everything. They open doors  they drive my car  they massage me  they will throw tennis balls  they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like  if I just sit  that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman  chauffeur  masseuse  chef and waiter.  And now the dog's really happy. And this  to me  is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it  such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. Now we move to phase three  when now    there's times  you know  when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge  and it says   Because I'm the daddy  that's why.  Sorry  no more explanation.  I'm the daddy  you're not. Sit.  And there's times  for example  if my son's friends leave the door open  the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life or death thing. You leave this  the sanctity of your house  and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know   You mustn't do this.  And so we have to enforce  but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do  right  You think it's something painful  or scary  or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is  but one definition  the most popular  is  a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior  such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty  scary or painful. And I would say  if it doesn't have to be  then maybe it shouldn't be. I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital  plus the brother in law  plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house  and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now  but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen  so while I was there    this was on the fourth visit    we did a four and a half hour down stay  with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat  she would say   Rover  on the mat  on the mat  on the mat.  The dog broke his down stay    times in four and a half hours  while she cooked dinner  because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see  the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did  she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals  grizzly bears    if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film  then it's a friend of mine who's trained it    killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear   Bad bear  bad bear   Voom  Your head now is     yards away  sailing through the air  OK  This is crazy. So  where do we go from here  We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me  the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies  and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills  horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy  but with the rest of the family at class. I mean  my all time classic is another  come here  one. You see someone in the park    and I'll cover my mic when I say this  because I don't want to wake you up    and there's the owner in the park  and their dog's over here  and they say   Rover  come here. Rover  come here. Rover  come here  you son of a bitch.  The dog says   I don't think so.  I mean  who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that  Instead  the dog says   I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously  when I've approached  I've gotten punished there.  I was walking onto a plane    this  for me  was a pivotal moment in my career  and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing  the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do  so we don't have to force them. You know  I puppy train my child. And the seminal moment was  I was getting on a plane in Dallas  and in row two was a father  I presume  and a young boy about five  kicking the back of the chair.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick.  Johnny  don't do that.  Kick  kick  kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over  grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this    when you go face to face with a puppy or a child  you say   What are you doing  Now stop it  stop it  stop it   And I went   Oh my God  do I do something   That child has lost everything    that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought   Do I tell this jerk to quit it   I thought   Ian  stay out of it  stay out of it  you know  walk on.  I walked to the back of the plane  I sat down  and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog  I would have laid him out. If he had kicked a dog  I would have punched him out. He kicked a child  grabs the child like this and I let it go. And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean  we as humans  our shallowness when we choose a life mate based on the three Cs    coat color  conformation  cuteness. You know  kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship  and it's hunky dory for a year. And then  a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes  or the wife's always late for meetings  whatever it is  OK  And it then starts  and we get into this thing  and our personal feedback    there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people  there is very little feedback  it's too infrequent. And when it happens  it's bad  it's nasty. You see it's especially in families  especially with spouses  especially with children  especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace  especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there  that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong  so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them. And this  I would say  is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted  and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know  calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid  I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now  but I could do it as a kid. Geometry  fantastic. You know  quantum mechanics    these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. And my look to the future is  and what I want to do with this doggy stuff  is to teach people that you know  your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier    if you got a Rottie    much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them  to time sample the behavior  and say  every five minutes  you ask the question   Is it good  or is it bad   If it's good  say   That was really neat  thank you.  That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships    how do you negotiate  How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy  You know  how to prepare you for your first relationship  How on earth about raising children  We think how we do it    one night in bed  we're pregnant  and then we're raising the most important thing in life  a child. No  this is what should be taught    the good living  the good habits  which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So  that would be my wish to the future. Ah  damn  I wanted to end exactly on time  but I got eight  seven  six  five  four  three  two    so thank you very much. That's my talk  thank you. I d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo  who was put to sleep a couple of days ago  because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.    Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     I'm just a'walking my dog  singing my song  strolling along.     Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong.     My life was lonely and blue.     Yeah  I was sad as a sailor      I was an angry 'un too.     Then there was you    appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear      and nerves jingle jangled  vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up.     But then I looked in your eyes     and I was no more a failure.     You looked so wacky and wise.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I'm just a'walking my dog      catching some sun. We can't go wrong.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  singing our song  strolling along.     'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don't care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.     My life was tragic and sad.     I was the archetypal loser.     I was a pageant gone bad.     And then there was you    on time  and wagging your tail     in the cutest mime that you was in jail.     I said   Woof  be mine   and you gave a wail and then     I was no longer alone.     And I was no more a boozer.     We'll make the happiest home.     And I said   Lord  I'm happy  'cause I m just a'walking my dog      singing my song  strolling along.      Yeah  it's just me and my dog  catching some sun. We can't go wrong      'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt      and I don t care what the politicians spout.     If you need a companion  why  just go out to the pound      and find yourself a hound  and make that doggie proud      'cause that's what it's all about      that's what it's all about      that's what it's all abou BOW WOW WOW WOW     that's what it's all about.      Dog panting noise  Heh  heh  heh  heh  heh.   Good dog  Thank you. Ninety nine percent of us have the dream of listeners. Not being the musicians    the listeners  right  And we crave one thing  even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded  the day it was played. And we go to live concerts  and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other    percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history  the little rougher it sounds. And so we said  there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance  as a thing  out from the recording  which was how it was made. You know  the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers  and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this  it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things    but full of solenoids  and fiber optics  and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high definition. And we were able to cross this line  called the uncanny valley  in terms of    artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we  you know  kind of put it into the computer and digitize it  and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note  and all the attributes of those notes  how hard they were struck  and how they were held down  and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And  you know  it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you  but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died    years ago this year  and was born    years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist  maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience  and felt like    a performing monkey was  in fact  his term. So he stepped back  and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called  The Goldberg Variations.  Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces  but late in his life  in his mature period  he said   Here's a theme       variations.  In fact  the theme isn't even the melody  it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about  one in mono  and one in stereo. And the one in mono  by the way  he used the pedal  and as he got older  he said   No  no  wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this  and not use the pedal.  What I'd like you to hear live is the      version  and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould      . How about that  So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all  let me get you to the end step. This is    we have a fairly complex process that  you know  software and musicians and so on  but when we're all done  we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear  and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now  what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording  and the left speaker is going to be the new recording  actually of an instrument just like that one  and I'm going to play them together at the same time. That's the original.  Unclear  That's the two together. Before  Jurassic Park   there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle  right  So  in the video world  we've been able to invent  in our lifetimes  natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately  I started with the experience. And the experience is  I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But  if not  there is now high definition surround sound. And I got to tell you  if you haven't heard high definition surround  go down to your audio dealer  your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that  maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings    Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument  and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones  and you listen to this  you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until  you know  the musicians  who are musicians who play the piano  listen to this  say   I can't believe it  It's just what it's like to play the piano.  Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano  and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer. Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood  and cast iron  and felt  and steel strings  and all these  and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session  you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there  sitting  kind of  on the side  and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things  step by step music will be turned into data  like every field that's occurred in the past    or    years. Audio has come very late to this game    I'm not talking about digitizing  and bits  and re mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from  which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool    they're high resolution  and they're wired straight to our emotions  and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement  you know. All right  there's this episode of  Star Trek.  I get it    it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of  Star Trek  for me was James Daly played Methuselah    remember this one  And at some point he's dancing with his    and I won't ruin the episode for you  from     . Right  do you know where I'm going  And Nimoy  I'm sorry  Spock sits down at the piano  and he starts playing this Brahms waltz  and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round  he goes   James  I know all of the Brahms waltzes  and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.  That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now  when we get to data  that we can distill styles  and templates  and formulas  and all these kinds of things  again  that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now  we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data    no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet  it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step  the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today  every time you take out your iPod and whatever  every time you listen to it  it's the same thing    it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened  it could be different  This morning  you're sadder  you want to hear your song  the same song  played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. We've seen all these  Star Treks   and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that  I get goose bumps. It's so amazing  it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like   Oh my God  I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.  It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to  in whatever form. And lastly  I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in     . And I've got to tell you  we have this lab where we build and measure everything  back in Raleigh  North Carolina  and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company  I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling  when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team  and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine  which has not changed since       still seats       people. And on the sweet spot on the stage  Tatum starts playing ... and every note  every beat  every slur  every accent  every pedal was perfect  because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately  it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig  and I want you to hear his humor. And that's just what the live audience did. So thank you very much  Michael  thank you for the opportunity. I have a tough job to do. You know  when I looked at the profile of the audience here  with their connotations and design  in all its forms  and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks  and so on  that I wanted to tell you  I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. In order to do that in    minutes  I have to bring out four ideas    it's like four pieces of a puzzle. And if I succeed in doing that  maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on  and perhaps help me do my work. The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now  by remoteness  I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course  remoteness in its normal sense  which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center  you get to remoter areas. What happens to education  The second  or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world  you have pockets  like slums  or shantytowns  or poorer areas  which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city  so it's us and them. What happens to education in that context  So keep both of those ideas of remoteness. We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. If they do have  they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure. And if they had some infrastructure  they have difficulty maintaining it. But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car  looked up on Google  found a route into northern India from New Delhi which  you know  which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about     kilometers  and wherever we found a school  administered a set of standard tests  and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. The graph was interesting  although you need to consider it carefully. I mean  this is a very small sample  you should not generalize from it. But it was quite obvious  quite clear  that for this particular route that I had taken  the remoter the school was  the worse its results seemed to be. That seemed a little damning  and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure  or with the availability of electricity  and things like that. To my surprise  it did not correlate. It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools  with one single question for the teachers    which was   Would you like to move to an urban  metropolitan area         percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that  they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi  and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi    because  you know  those are relatively better off areas    and then from     kilometers out of Delhi  the answer is consistently yes. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that  I wish I was in some other school  probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools  as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat  and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way. When you take education and technology  then I find in the literature that  you know  things like websites  collaborative environments    you've been listening to all that in the morning    it's always piloted first in the best schools  the best urban schools  and  according to me  biases the result. The literature    one part of it  the scientific literature    consistently blames ET as being over hyped and under performing. The teachers always say  well  it's fine  but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting  let's say     percent of whatever they could do. You put in this new super duper technology  and now they get    percent. So the principal looks at it and says    percent for         dollars  Forget it. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools  where the score was    percent  and  let's say  took that up to    percent    that will be a completely different thing. So the relative change that ET  Educational Technology  would make  would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top  but we seem to be doing it the other way about. So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first  not the other way about. And finally came the question of  how do you tackle teacher perception  Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology  the teacher's first reaction is  you cannot replace a teacher with a machine    it's impossible. I don't know why it's impossible  but  even for a moment  if you did assume that it's impossible    I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke  the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo  and he said something which completely solves this problem. He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine  should be. So  you know  it puts the teacher into a tough bind  you have to think. Anyway  so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education  whatever alternative you want  is required where schools don't exist  where schools are not good enough  where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough  for whatever reason. If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies  then you don't need an alternative education. So far I haven't come across such an area  except for one case. I won't name the area  but somewhere in the world people said  we don't have this problem  because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. There are such areas  but    anyway  I'd never heard that anywhere else. I'm going to talk about children and self organization  and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They're called the hole in the wall experiments. I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments. The first one was done in New Delhi in     . And what we did over there was pretty much simple. I had an office in those days which bordered a slum  an urban slum  so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. They cut a hole inside that wall    which is how it has got the name hole in the wall    and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole  sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end  a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall  put it on high speed Internet  put the Internet Explorer there  put it on Altavista.com    in those days    and just left it there. And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole in the wall. About eight hours later  we found this kid. To the right is this eight year old child who    and to his left is a six year old girl  who is not very tall. And what he was doing was  he was teaching her to browse. So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. Is this real  Does the language matter  because he's not supposed to know English  Will the computer last  or will they break it and steal it    and did anyone teach them  The last question is what everybody said  but you know  I mean  they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office  can you show me how to do it  and then somebody taught him. So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it  this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India  where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything. So it was a warm day  and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there  he later on turned out to be a    year old school dropout. He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. Very quickly  he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen    and later on he told me   I have never seen a television where you can do something.  So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. And then  as he was doing that  he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad    you'll see him do that. He did that  and the Internet Explorer changed page. Eight minutes later  he looked from his hand to the screen  and he was browsing  he was going back and forth. When that happened  he started calling all the neighborhood children  like  children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day     children were all browsing. So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there. So we thought that this is what was happening  that children in groups can self instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances  At this time there was a    the main question was about English. People said  you know  you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said  have what  shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language  That's not possible. So  it has to be the other way about. But let's see  how do the children tackle the English language  I took the experiment out to northeastern India  to a village called Madantusi  where  for some reason  there was no English teacher  so the children had not learned English at all. And I built a similar hole in the wall. One big difference in the villages  as opposed to the urban slums  there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. In the urban slums  the girls tend to stay away. I left the computer there with lots of CDs    I didn't have any Internet    and came back three months later. So when I came back there  I found these two kids  eight  and    year olds  who were playing a game on the computer. And as soon as they saw me they said   We need a faster processor and a better mouse.  I was real surprised. You know  how on earth did they know all this  And they said   Well  we've picked it up from the CDs.  So I said   But how did you understand what's going on over there   So they said   Well  you've left this machine which talks only in English  so we had to learn English.  So then I measured  and they were using     English words with each other    mispronounced  but correct usage    words like exit  stop  find  save  that kind of thing  not only to do with the computer but in their day to day conversations. So  Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier  in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to. Finally  I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable  if they happen everywhere else. India is a good place to do such an experiment in  because we have all the ethnic diversities  all the    you know  the genetic diversity  all the racial diversities  and also all the socio economic diversities. So  I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. So I did this for almost five years  and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India. This is the Himalayas. Up in the north  very cold. I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors  and I was using regular  normal PCs  so I needed different climates  for which India is also great  because we have very cold  very hot  and so on. This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. And you see here a little clip of    one of these villages    the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet. Then to central India    very warm  moist  fishing villages  where humidity is a very big killer of electronics. So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power  so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. This sequence is also nice. This is a small child  a six year old  telling his eldest sister what to do. And this happens very often with these computers  that the younger children are found teaching the older ones. What did we find  We found that six  to    year olds can self instruct in a connected environment  irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer  they will teach themselves  including intelligence. I couldn't find a single correlation with anything  but it had to be in groups. And that may be of great  you know  interest to this group  because all of you are talking about groups. So here was the power of what a group of children can do  if you lift the adult intervention. Just a quick idea of the measurements. We took standard statistical techniques  so I'm going to not talk about that. But we got a clean learning curve  almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. I'll leave it at that  because  I mean  it sort of says it all  doesn't it  What could they learn to do  Basic Windows functions  browsing  painting  chatting and email  games and educational material  music downloads  playing video. In short  what all of us do. And over     children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer. So  how do they do that  If you calculated the actual time of access  it would work out to minutes per day  so that's not how it's happening. What you have  actually  is there is one child operating the computer. And surrounding him are usually three other children  who are advising him on what they should do. If you test them  all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. Around these four are usually a group of about    children  who are also advising  usually wrongly  about everything that's going on on the computer. And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. It seems counter intuitive to adult learning  but remember  eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told  don't do this  you know  don't touch the whiskey bottle. So what does the eight year old do  He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. And if you tested him  he would answer every question correctly on that topic. So  they seem to be able to acquire very quickly. So what was the conclusion over the six years of work  It was that primary education can happen on its own  or parts of it can happen on its own. It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards. It could perhaps be a self organizing system  so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you  that children can self organize and attain an educational objective. The third piece was on values  and again  to put it very briefly  I conducted a test over     children spread across all over India  and asked them    I gave them about    different values oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. We got all sorts of opinions. Yes  no or I don't know. I simply took those questions where I got    percent yeses and    percent noes    so I was able to get a collection of    such statements. These were areas where the children were clearly confused  because half said yes and half said no. A typical example being   Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.  They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question  perhaps none of us do. So I leave you with this third question. Can technology alter the acquisition of values  Finally  self organizing systems  about which  again  I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it. Natural systems are all self organizing  galaxies  molecules  cells  organisms  societies    except for the debate about an intelligent designer. But at this point in time  as far as science goes  it's self organization. But other examples are traffic jams  stock market  society and disaster recovery  terrorism and insurgency. And you know about the Internet based self organizing systems. So here are my four sentences then. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first  and other areas later. Values are acquired  doctrine and dogma are imposed    the two opposing mechanisms. And learning is most likely a self organizing system. If you put all the four together  then it gives    according to me    it gives us a goal  a vision  for educational technology. An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital  automatic  fault tolerant  minimally invasive  connected and self organized. As educationists  we have never asked for technology  we keep borrowing it. PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology  but it was not meant for education  it was meant for making boardroom presentations. We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself. I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs  and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that. And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness  values and violence. So I thought I'd give it a name    why don't we call it  outdoctrination.  And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future  So I want to leave that as a thought with you. Thank you. So what's image got do with it  And I must say  I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages  because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up. But I'm going to try and do something different  and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories  and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So  Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions  as you can see. We're not the only ones. And you know  it's amazing. I mean  we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that  you know  And this is typically what we've been talking about  the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now  why is that a problem  A typical disaster story  disease  corruption  poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking  saying   OK  you know  Ory  you're Harvard educated  and all you privileged people come here  saying  'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets  and whatever.'   And they're all   There's the    percent of Africans who really need help.  And I want to tell you that this is my story  OK  And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire  but I know what it is to grow up without having money  or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know  when things were good  we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad  we had porridge. And like many African families  my parents could never save because they supported siblings  cousins  you know  their parents  and things were always dicey. Now  when I was born  they realized they had a pretty smart kid  and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school  which was free. And they adopted a very interesting approach to education  which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private  Catholic  elementary school  which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was  because they could afford it sometimes  sometimes not  I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know  someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees  and when they started getting pretty strict  you had to leave  until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking  I mean  why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school  Because you know  as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive  and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it  and I now understand why they did what they did. They talk about corruption. In Kenya  we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there's national schools  which are like the best schools  and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School  a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed  and I was like   Oh my God  you know  what am I going to do   And my father said   OK  listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know  it's just one point. I mean  maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.  So we went to the school  and because we were nobodies  and because we didn't have privilege  and because my father didn't have the right last name  he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him  saying  you know  who do you think you are  And  you know  you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls  who were kids of politicians  and who had done much  much worse than I did  and they had slots there. And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you  you know  And we left  and I swore to myself  and I was like   I'm never  ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.  They called me two weeks later  they're like  oh  yeah  you can come now. And I told them to stuff it. Final story  and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father  who I've been talking about  died of AIDS in     . He never told anyone that he had AIDS  his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out  because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time  and they called me. He was very sick  the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google  Cryptococcal meningitis  you know. Because of doctor patient privilege  they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like  you know  this is a long term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious    read about the disease  I pretty much realized what was going on. The first time he got sick  he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that  at that time    Diflucan  which in the States is used for yeast infections    cost    dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know  so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time  he had a friend who used to travel to India  and he used to import  bring him  could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time  there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya  and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally  we figured  well  OK  we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him. And  you know  now  imagine if    and I could go on and on    imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me  With pity  you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don't see the other side of me. You don't see the blogger  you don't see the Harvard educated lawyer  the vibrant person  you know  And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms  and you wonder  you know  so what  But it's damaging. And I'm not unique  right  Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn't know about the windmill  you know  And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like  I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him  you know   Just do it   And this is  again  the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters       we're ignoring the potential. So  what is to be done  First of all  Africans  we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example  you know  blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories  let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make  this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about    million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males    non native speakers. The other person is    Ndesanjo  if you're here  stand up    is a Tanzanian   the  first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this. People  please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing  Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers  Why are we not generating our own content  You know  it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So  that's a start  and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach  you know  is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live    we're still not anywhere in the picture. No  you're not. But the point I'm trying to make  though  is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be  should I move back  should I stay  You know  just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough  you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.  Covington and Burling  six figures. With two paychecks  or three paychecks  I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that  because my passion was here  and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here  you know  I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing. One is because I'm pretty aggressive  and I try and find  you know  opportunities. But there is such a need  you know  I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services  as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya  and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner  M  who's a tech guru  hacked WordPress. It costs us  like     dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP  questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function  where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate  and come back and ask. And basically  we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know  I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing  You know  they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies  we need    where's that coming from  you know  Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars  you know  They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like  And how can we change that  So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here  I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. And I'd ask all of you  when you leave here  please just share  and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going  because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like   OK  if you don't do aid  I'm a bleeding heart liberal  what can I do   And when I talk about my ideas  they're like   BBut it's not scalable  you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal.  It's not that easy  you know  And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual  in the fellows you've met  and the businesspeople you've met  it can make a huge difference  especially in Africa  because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean  when I was a first year student in law school  my mom's business had collapsed  so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees  and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees. A cousin of mine died of AIDS  left an orphan  so we said  well  what are we going to do with her  You know  she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me  I am able to lift all those people. So  don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor  Mitchell Seligson. And because of him  I got into Harvard Law School  because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his  and he was just like  this is an overeager student  which we don't normally get in the United States  because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said   What do you want to do when you grow up   I said   I want to be a lawyer.  And he was like   Why  You know  we don't need another lawyer in the United States.  And he tried to talk me out of it  but it was like   OK  I know nothing about applying to law school  I'm poli sci Ph.D. But  you know  let's figure out what I need you to do  what I need to do to help you out.  It was like   Where do you want to go   And to me at that time university    I was at University of Pitts for undergrad  and that was like heaven  OK  because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like   Yeah  I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.  He was like   Why  You know  you're smart  you have all these things going for you.  And I'm like   Because I'm here and it's cheap  and you know  I kind of like Pittsburgh.  Like  that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And  you know  so he took me under his wing  and he encouraged me. And he said   Look  you can get into Harvard  you're that good  OK  And if they don't admit you  they're the ones who are messed up.  And he built me up  you know  And this is just an illustration. You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically  I want to end with my vision for Africa  you know  A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know  my vision is that my daughter  and any other African child being born today  can be whoever they want to be here  without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted  you know  That you can grow up  you know  not so good circumstances  and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas  whatever  that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today  where you live  or where you were born  and the circumstances under which you were born  determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change  and the change starts with us. And as Africans  we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you. Stephanie White  I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name  Einstein  Einstein. SW  This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone  hi   E  Hello. SW  That's nice. Can you be polite  E  Hi  sweetheart. SW  Much better. Well  Einstein is very honored to be here at TED       amongst all you modern day Einsteins. In fact  she's very excited. E  Woo. SW  Yeah. Since we've arrived  there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap up on Saturday. Einstein  did you hear whispers  E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves  which can get pretty dusty. E  Achoo  SW  It could make her sneeze. But more importantly  her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never ending scratchy throat. Einstein   Coughs  SW  Yeah. Well  Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well  that's really cool  but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five pound peanut. E  Oh  my God  My God  My God  SW  Yeah. She would get really  really excited. That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird  she's very interested in things that fly. She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive. E  Ooh. SW  Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement  SpaceShipOne. Einstein  would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship  E   Spaceship noise  SW  Even if it doesn't have a laser  E   Laser noise  SW  Yeah  yeah. That was pretty funny  Einstein. Now  Einstein also thinks  you know  working in caves and travelling through space    it's all very dangerous jobs. It would be very dangerous if you fell down. E  Wheeeeeee   Splat  SW  Yeah. Little splat at the end there. Einstein  did that hurt  E  Ow  ow  ow. SW  Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated. E   Squawks  SW  Yeah  it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public  she loves to take in the arts. If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner  Einstein could sure fit the bill  because she loves to dance. Can you get down  E   Bobbing head   Laughter  SW  Let's get down for everybody. Come on now. She's going to make me do it  too. Ooh  ooh. Einstein  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Do your head now. E  Ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. SW  Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin  and Einstein can sing along with some opera  E   Operatic squawk  SW  Very good. Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer  Einstein  can you also sing  I know  you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing  E  La  la. SW  There you go. And  of course  if all else fails  you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta. E   Squawks  SW  All right. Well  Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier  but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem. E  What's the matter  SW  No  I don't have a problem. You have the problem  remember  You were saying that you were really embarrassed  because you're in love with a pirate  E  Yar. SW  There you go. And what do pirates like to drink  E  Beer. SW  Yeah  that's right. But you don't like to drink beer  Einstein. You like to drink water. E   Water sound  SW  Very good. Now  really  she is pretty nervous. Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here  and she's pretty nervous to meet him. She thinks Al Gore is a really good looking man. What do you say to a good looking man  E  Hey  baby. SW  And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee. E  Yee haw. SW  And since she's such a big fan  she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then  so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. So let's see if Einstein will sing  Happy Birthday  to Al Gore. Can you sing  Happy Birthday  to him  E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Again. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Big finish. E  Happy birthday to you. SW  Good job  Well  before we wrap it up  she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. Einstein  do you want to say  hi  to all the owls  E  Woo  woo  woo. SW  What about the other birds  E  Tweet  tweet  tweet. SW  And the penguin  E  Quack  quack  quack. SW  There we go. Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee  E  Ooh  ooh  ooh. Aah  aah  aah. SW  Very good. What about a wolf  E  Ooooowww. SW  And a pig  E  Oink  oink  oink. SW  And the rooster  E  Cock a doodle doo  SW  And how about those cats  E  Meow. SW  At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. E  Grrrrr. SW  What about a skunk  E  Stinker. SW  She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous  Are you famous  E  Superstar. SW  Yeah. You are a superstar. Well  we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends  and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live  in . Now  Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home  E  I'm special. SW  You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people  E  I love you. SW  That's good. Can you blow them a kiss  E   Kissing noise  SW  And what do you say when it's time to go  E  Goodbye. SW  Good job. Thank you all.
