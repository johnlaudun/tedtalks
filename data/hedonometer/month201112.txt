Now when we think of our senses  we don't usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved  from a biological perspective. We don't really think of the evolutionary need to be protected by our senses  but that's probably why our senses really evolved    to keep us safe  to allow us to live. Really when we think of our senses  or when we think of the loss of the sense  we really think about something more like this  the ability to touch something luxurious  to taste something delicious  to smell something fragrant  to see something beautiful. This is what we want out of our senses. We want beauty  we don't just want function. And when it comes to sensory restoration  we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty. And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today. Likewise for hearing. When we think about why we hear  we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren  although clearly that's an important thing. Really what we want to hear is music. So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. Many of you know that he was deaf  or near profoundly deaf  when he wrote that. Now I'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music. Music is just one of the strangest things that there is. It's acoustic vibrations in the air  little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum. Somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones  which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music. That process is entirely abstract and very  very unusual. And we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out  how is it that we hear something that's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air  Turns out that if you have hearing loss  most people that lose their hearing lose it at what's called the cochlea  the inner ear. And it's at the hair cell level that they do this. Now if you had to pick a sense to lose  I have to be very honest with you and say  we're better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is. In fact  nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing. And as a physician and a surgeon  I can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose  we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing. As a musician  I can tell you that if I had to have a cochlear implant  I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken  because I know that music would never sound the same to me. Now this is a video that I'm going to show you of a girl who's born deaf. She's in a very supportive environment. Her mother's doing everything she can. Okay  play that video please. Owl  yeah. Owl. Owl. Yeah. Baby. Baby. You want it  Charles Limb  Now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple infused learning  there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf  an infant who was born deaf  has in this world in terms of social  educational  vocational opportunities. I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful  wonderful life. I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face. Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past     years. I mean literally  they used to do things like stick ear shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in. And that was the best you could do for hearing loss. Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum. So it's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss. And now today we have the modern multi channel cochlear implant  which is an outpatient procedure. It's surgically placed inside the inner ear. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours  depending on where it's done  under general anesthesia. And in the end  you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea. Now actually  this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear. But here is that same girl who is implanted now. This is her    years later. And this is a video that was taken by my surgical mentor  Dr. John Niparko  who implanted her. If we could play this video please. Girl  I have written two books.  Mother  Was the other one a book or a journal entry   Girl  No  the other one was a book.  Mother  Oh  okay.  JN  Well this book has seven chapters  and the last chapter is entitled  The Good Things About Being Deaf.  Do you remember writing that chapter  Girl  Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter. JN  Yeah. Girl  Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying. So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her. JN  I see. And who is that  Girl  Holly.  JN  Okay.  Mother  Her sister.  JN  Her sister.  Girl  My sister. JN  And how can you avoid being annoyed by her  Girl  I just take off my CI  and I don't hear anything. It comes in handy. JN  So you don't want to hear everything that's out there  Girl  No. CL  And so she's phenomenal. And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success. It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine. However  despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language  you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all. In fact  most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad. And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody's life  we have a long way to go when it comes to audition. Now there are a lot of reasons for that. I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it's abstract. Language is very different. Language is very precise. In fact  the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic specificity. When you say a word  what you care is that word was perceived correctly. You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken. Music is entirely different. When you hear music  if it doesn't sound good  what's the point  There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you. The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language. And you can see on this figure  that the frequency range and the decibel range  the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous. So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant  what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission. Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing. If you can hear music  you should be able to hear anything. Now the problems begin first with pitch perception. I mean  most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music. And without the ability to perceive pitch well  music and melody is a very difficult thing to do    forget about a harmony and things like that. Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude. Now if we could just play this. Okay  now if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves  let's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone. We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users. Go ahead and play this one. Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation. You distort it a little bit  especially in terms of pitch  and you've changed it. And it might be that you kind of like that. That's kind of hypnotic. But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended. And you're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing. Now the other issue comes with  not just the ability to tell pitches apart  but the ability to tell sounds apart. Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument. If we could play these two sound clips in succession. The trumpet. And the second one. That's a violin. These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments. Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments. The sound quality  or the sound of the sound is how I like to describe timbre  tone color    they cannot tell these things whatsoever. This implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth. Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech  have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody  what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech. You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech  they were designed for speech. But actually if you look at melody  what you find is that there's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls. So for whatever reason  this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception. Now the next question is  well how does it really sound  Now we've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users. I'm going to play you two clips of Usher  one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies  almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies. Go ahead and play that. I had patients tell me that those sound the same. They cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips. Again  we are very  very far away in just getting to where we want to get to. Now the question comes to mind  Is there any hope  And yes  there is hope. Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is. This is ... does somebody know  This is Beethoven. Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like  Because his grave was exhumed. And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness  which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there. But Beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing. What that suggests is that  even in the case of hearing loss  the capacity for music remains. The brains remain hardwired for music. I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo where I've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants. This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food. Text  Beethoven doesn't excite her. The       Overture  isn't worth waking for. But she jumps to action when called to duty  CL  Now I'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it. I'm suggesting that with training you can imbue a musical sound with significance  even in a cat. If we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music    because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that  no rehabilitative strategies  very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music    we would come a long way. Now I want to show you one last video. And this is of a student of mine named Joseph who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab. He's deaf  and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant. And here's a video of Joseph. And at about four months old  I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss. Not long after  I was fitted with hearing aids. But although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time  they weren't very helpful. So as a result  I had to rely on lip reading a lot  and I couldn't really hear what people were saying. When I was    years old  I was one of the first few people in Singapore who underwent cochlear implantation. And not long after I got my cochlear implant  I started learning how to play piano. And it was absolutely wonderful. Since then  I've never looked back. CL  Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant. He is now a medical student at Yale University  and he's contemplating a surgical career    one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery. There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere. And this is really unheard of stuff  and this is all because of this technology. And the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain. Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant  because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time. You don't actually have to hear it. I know he doesn't hear well  because I've heard him do Karaoke. And it's one of the most awful things    heartwarming  but awful. And so there is certainly a lot of hope  but there's a lot more that needs to be done. So I just want to conclude with the following words. When it comes to restoration of hearing  we have certainly come a long way  a remarkably long way. And we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing. And let me tell you right now  it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech. But I tell you  if we lost our hearing  if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing  you would want perfect hearing back. You wouldn't want decent hearing  you would want perfect hearing. Restoration of basic sensory function is critical. And I don't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function. But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring. And I don't think that we should give up on beauty. And I want to thank you for your time. So that's Johnny Depp  of course. And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder. And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo. Some of you might know that  in       Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder  and he had tattooed on his right shoulder  Winona forever.  And then three years later    which in fairness  kind of is forever by Hollywood standards    they broke up  and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done. And now his shoulder says   Wino forever.  So like Johnny Depp  and like    percent of Americans between the ages of    and     I have a tattoo. I first started thinking about getting it in my mid   s  but I deliberately waited a really long time. Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were    or    or    and regretted it by the time they were   . That didn't happen to me. I got my tattoo when I was     and I regretted it instantly. And by  regretted it   I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place    this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side    and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street. Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares. And then I went home that night  and I had an even larger emotional meltdown  which I'll say more about in a minute. And this was all actually quite shocking to me  because prior to this moment  I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets. I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions  of course. I do that hourly. But I had always felt like  look  you know  I made the best choice I could make given who I was then  given the information I had on hand. I learned a lesson from it. It somehow got me to where I am in life right now. And okay  I wouldn't change it. In other words  I had drunk our great cultural Kool Aid about regret  which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time  that we should always look forward and not backward  and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets. This idea is nicely captured by this quote   Things without all remedy should be without regard  what's done is done.  And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first    something we might all agree to sign onto ... until I tell you who said it. Right  so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people. And as it happens  Shakespeare was onto something here  as he generally was. Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths. It's also  by the way  a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage. So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions. So if  in fact  you want to live a life free of regret  there is an option open to you. It's called a lobotomy. But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane  I think you need to learn to live  not without regret  but with it. So let's start off by defining some terms. What is regret  Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past. So in other words  regret requires two things. It requires  first of all  agency    we had to make a decision in the first place. And second of all  it requires imagination. We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice  and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present. And in fact  the more we have of either of these things    the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret  the more acute that regret will be. So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic  and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight. You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by   . Why  Well because  if you miss your flight by three minutes  it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome.  I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel. I should have gone through that yellow light.  These are the classic conditions that create regret. We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly  but almost came out well. Now within that framework  we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things. This session today is about behavioral economics. And most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain. We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them    buyer's remorse  basically. But then finally  it occurred to some researchers to step back and say  well okay  but overall  what do we regret most in life  Here's what the answers turn out to look like. So top six regrets    the things we regret most in life  Number one by far  education.    percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education. We wish we'd gotten more of it. We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have. We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic. Others very high on our list of regrets include career  romance  parenting  various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time    or actually more specifically  how we fail to spend our leisure time. The remaining regrets pertain to these things  finance  family issues unrelated to romance or parenting  health  friends  spirituality and community. So in other words  we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance. But it turns out  when you look overall at what people regret in life  you know what  our financial decisions don't even rank. They account for less than three percent of our total regrets. So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap  or company A versus company B  or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius  you know what  let it go. Odds are  you're not going to care in five years. But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around  what does that experience feel like  We all know the short answer. It feels terrible. Regret feels awful. But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial. When I went home that night after getting my tattoo  I basically stayed up all night. And for the first several hours  there was exactly one thought in my head. And the thought was   Make it go away   This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response. I mean  it's right up there with   I want my mommy   We're not trying to solve the problem. We're not trying to understand how the problem came about. We just want it to vanish. The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was   How could I have done that  What was I thinking   This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret. We can't identify with that part. We don't understand that part. And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part    which explains the third consistent component of regret  which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. That's why  in the face of our regret  the thing we consistently say is   I could have kicked myself.  The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing. Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night  thinking   Make it go away.  It's that I sat there and I thought   Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away.  So if you look at the psychological literature  these are the four consistent defining components of regret. But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one. And I think of this as a kind of existential wake up call. That night in my apartment  after I got done kicking myself and so forth  I lay in bed for a long time  and I thought about skin grafts. And then I thought about how  much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God  probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy. In point of fact  no insurance covers acts of idiocy. The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured  they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of  frankly  a fairly indifferent universe. This is obviously an incredibly painful experience. And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control Z culture    Control Z like the computer command  undo. We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities  in a certain sense. We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem    we can undo and unfriend and unfollow. And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change and we cannot. Sometimes instead of Control Z  we actually have zero control. And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists    and I know where of I speak    this is really hard  because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right. Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos  and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes. But first I want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about. So for instance  here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life. Text  Relpy to all. And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing  we can experience a huge range of regret. You can accidentally hit  reply all  to an email and torpedo a relationship. Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work. Or you can have your last day at work. And this doesn't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life. Because of course  sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences  either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods  and in the very worst case scenario  even their lives. Now obviously  those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring. I mean  even the stupid  reply all  regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days. So how are we supposed to live with this  I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret. And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality. If you Google regret and tattoo  you will get   .  million hits. The FDA estimates that of all the Americans who have tattoos     percent of us regret getting them. That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends. And that's just regret about tattoos. We are all in this together. The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves. Now in my case  this really wasn't a problem  because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're    years old and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo. But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets. I don't think that's the case though. All of us who've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive. It connects the poles of our lives back together  the positive and the negative  and it sends a little current of life back into us. The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time  which  as we know  heals all wounds    except for tattoos  which are permanent. So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo. And do you guys just want to see it  All right. Actually  you know what  I should warn you  you're going to be disappointed. Because it's actually not that hideous. I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something. When other people see my tattoo  for the most part they like how it looks. It's just that I don't like how it looks. And as I said earlier  I'm a perfectionist. But I'll let you see it anyway. This is my tattoo. I can guess what some of you are thinking. So let me reassure you about something. Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are. I got this tattoo because I spent most of my   s living outside the country and traveling. And when I came and settled in New York afterward  I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time. Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and  simultaneously  how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north. And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image. And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device. Well it did. But it turns out  it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would  it reminds me constantly of something else instead. It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us  which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us. And ironically  I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body    partly as a writer  but also just as a human being. Here's the thing  if we have goals and dreams  and we want to do our best  and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them  we should feel pain when things go wrong. The point isn't to live without any regrets. The point is to not hate ourselves for having them. The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this  We need to learn to love the flawed  imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them. Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly. It reminds us that we know we can do better. Thank you. Good afternoon  I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can  and actually is changing the world  and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote  or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers  a Monty Python type of sketch. Here it is. It is December         . Somebody gives you a bet  you will look at a crystal ball  and you will see the future  the future will be accurate. But you need to share it with the world. OK  curiosity killed the cat  you take the bet  you look at the crystal ball. One hour later  you're sitting in a building of the national TV  in a top show  and you tell the story. Before the end of       Ben Ali  and Mubarak  and Gaddafi would be down  and prosecuted. Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged  or already on their knees. Osama bin Laden would be dead  and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague. Now  the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face. And then  on top of it you add   And thousands of young people from Athens  Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice  claiming they are inspired by Arabs.  Next thing you know  two guys in white appear  they give you the strange t shirt  take you to the nearest mental institution. So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power. Well  people power has been there for a while. It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India  it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle. It helped a local  Lech Walesa  to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland  and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it. So what's new in it  What seems to be very new  which is the idea I would like to share with you today  is that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle. If this is true  we can help these movements. Well  the first one   analytic skills. I'll try where it all started in the Middle East. And for so many years  we were living with a completely wrong perception of the Middle East. It was looking like the frozen region. Literally a refrigerator. And there were only two types of meal there. Steak  which stands for a Mubarak Ben Ali type of military police dictatorship  or a potato  which stands for a Tehran type of theocracies. And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened  and millions of young  mainly secular people stepped out to do the change. Guess what   they didn't watch the demographics. What is the average age of an Egyptian    . How long was Mubarak in power    . So  this system was just obsolete  they expired. And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning  and understood that power lies in their hands. The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what  The same Generation Y  with their rules  with their tools  with their games  and with their language  which sounds a little bit strange to me. I'm    now. And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe  It seems that Generation Y is coming. Now  let me set another example. I'm meeting different people throughout the world  and they are  you know  academics  and professors  and doctors  and they will always talk conditions. They will say   People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive.  They will say   People power will work  if the annual income of the country is between X and Z.  They will say   People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure.  They will say   People power will work only if there is no oil.  And  I mean  there is a set of conditions. Well  the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. Namely  the skills of unity  planning  and maintaining nonviolent discipline. Let me give you an example. I come from a country called Serbia. It took us    years to unite    opposition party leaders  with their big egos  behind one single candidate against the Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic. Guess what  That was the day of his defeat. You look at the Egyptians  they fight on Tahrir Square  they get rid of their individual symbols  they appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt. I will give you a counter example. You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko  you all know the outcome. So unity is a big thing. And this can be achieved. Same with planning. Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution. That thing doesn't exist in the world. Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military  somebody was thinking about it before. Now  at the end  nonviolent discipline. And this is probably the game changer. If you maintain nonviolent discipline  you'll exclusively win. You have         people in a nonviolent march  one idiot or agent provocateur throwing a stone. Guess what takes all the cameras. That one guy. One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement. Now  let me move to another place. It's the selection of strategies and tactics. There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow. First  you start small. Second  you pick the battles you can win. It's only     of us in this room. We won't call for the march of a million. But what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night  all over Krakow. The city will know. So  we pick tactics accommodated to the event  especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion. They're very useful in violent oppression. We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used. It was on Tahrir square  where the international community was constantly frightened that  you know  the Islamists will overtake the revolution. What they organized    Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying  a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims  the world has just changed the picture  but somebody was thinking about this previously. So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place  shouting  and you know  showing off in front of the security forces. Now  there is also another very important dynamic. And this is a dynamic that analysts normally don't see. This is the dynamic between fear and apathy on the one side  and enthusiasm and humor on another side. So  it works like in a video game. You have the fear high  you have status quo. You have the enthusiasm higher  you see the fear is starting to melt. Day two  you see people running towards the police instead of from the police  in Egypt. You can tell that something is happening there. And then  it's about the humor. Humor is such a powerful game changer  and of course  it was very big in Poland. You know  we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit. We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait of Mr. President on it  in the middle of the Main Street. There was a hole in the top. So you could literally come  put a coin in  get a baseball bat  and hit his face. Sounds loud. And within minutes  we were sitting in a nearby caf  having coffee  and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing. Well  that's just the beginning of the show. The real show starts when the police appears.  What will they do   Arrest us  We were nowhere to be seen. We were like three blocks away  observing it from our espresso bar. Arrest the shoppers  with kids  Doesn't make sense. Of course  you could bet  they did the most stupid thing. They arrested the barrel. And now  the picture of the smashed face on the barrel  with the policemen dragging it to the police car  that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have. So  I mean  these are the things you can do. And you can always use humor. There is also one big thing about humor  it really hurts. Because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously. When you start to mock them  it hurts. Now  everybody is talking about His Majesty  the Internet  and it is also a very useful skill. But don't rush to label things like  a Facebook Revolution    Twitter Revolution.  Don't  confuse  the tools with the substance. It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper. They also make it a bit safer for the participants  because they give partial anonymity. We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do. It can put the price tag of state sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. This is the famous group  We are all Khaled Said   made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt  and his friend. This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police. This is how he became known to the public  and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel's back. But here is also the bad news. The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world  in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy  or  you know  the economy  if you sit down and click. There are risks to be taken  and there are living people who are winning the struggle. Well  the million dollar question. What will happen in the Arab world  And though young people from the Arab world were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators  shaking the region  kind of persuading the clever kings from Jordan and Morocco to do substantial reforms  it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome. Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition  or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflicts  whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline  faced with a brutal daily violence which kills thousands already  or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war. Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds  We cannot tell. The same works for the Western sector  where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world  occupying this  occupying that. Are they going to become the world wave  Are they going to find their skills  their enthusiasm  and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform  or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate  This is the difference between the two paths. Now  what do the statistics have  My friend Maria Stephan's book talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle  and there are some shocking data. If you look at the last    years and different social transitions  from dictatorship to democracy  you will see that  out of    different cases  in    of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power. This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon  this is one more reason to look at Generation Y. Enough for me to give them credit  and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world. Thank you. How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this  How many of you found it really  really annoying  Okay  outstanding. So I invented that. Or I was one of the people who did it. That thing is called a CAPTCHA. And the reason it is there is to make sure you  the entity filling out the form  are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times. The reason it works is because humans  at least non visually impaired humans  have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters  whereas computer programs simply can't do it as well yet. So for example  in the case of Ticketmaster  the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets  two at a time. CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet. And since they're used so often  a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate. So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page. The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W  A  I  T  which  of course  spell a word. But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about    minutes later. Text   Help  I've been waiting for over    minutes  and nothing happens.  This person thought they needed to wait. This of course  is not as bad as this poor person. CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over    years ago  and it's been used everywhere. Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later  which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA. This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA  which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon  then we turned it into a startup company. And then about a year and a half ago  Google actually acquired this company. So let me tell you what this project started. So this project started from the following realization  It turns out that approximately     million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world. When I first heard this  I was quite proud of myself. I thought  look at the impact that my research has had. But then I started feeling bad. See here's the thing  each time you type a CAPTCHA  essentially you waste    seconds of your time. And if you multiply that by     million  you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about         hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs. So then I started feeling bad. And then I started thinking  well  of course  we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs  because the security of the Web sort of depends on them. But then I started thinking  is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity  So see  here's the thing. While you're typing a CAPTCHA  during those    seconds  your brain is doing something amazing. Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do. So can we get you to do useful work for those    seconds  Another way of putting it is  is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve  yet we can split into tiny    second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem  And the answer to that is  yes   and this is what we're doing now. So what you may not know is that nowadays while you're typing a CAPTCHA  not only are you authenticating yourself as a human  but in addition you're actually helping us to digitize books. So let me explain how this works. So there's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books. Google has one. The Internet Archive has one. Amazon  now with the Kindle  is trying to digitize books. Basically the way this works is you start with an old book. You've seen those things  right  Like a book  So you start with a book  and then you scan it. Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book. It gives you an image for every page of the book. This is an image with text for every page of the book. The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image. That's using a technology called OCR  for optical character recognition  which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there. Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect. Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow  OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words. For example  for things that were written more than    years ago  the computer cannot recognize about    percent of the words. So what we're doing now is we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet. So the next time you type a CAPTCHA  these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize. And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because  you see  one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book  it didn't know what it was  and it's going to present it to you. But since it doesn't know the answer for it  it cannot grade it for you. So what we do is we give you another word  one for which the system does know the answer. We don't tell you which one's which  and we say  please type both. And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer  it assumes you are human  and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly. And if we repeat this process to like    different people and all of them agree on what the new word is  then we get one more word digitized accurately. So this is how the system works. And basically  since we released it about three or four years ago  a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books. So for example  Ticketmaster. So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster  you help to digitize a book. Facebook  Every time you add a friend or poke somebody  you help to digitize a book. Twitter and about         other sites are all using reCAPTCHA. And in fact  the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we're digitizing per day is really  really large. It's about     million a day  which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year. And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet. Now of course  since we're doing so many words per day  funny things can happen. And this is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other. So funny things can happen. For example  we presented this word. It's the word  Christians   there's nothing wrong with it. But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word  bad things can happen. So we get this.  Text  bad christians  But it's even worse  because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God. Oops. Here's another really bad one. JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday. Now  of course  we're not just insulting people. See here's the thing  since we're presenting two randomly chosen words  interesting things can happen. So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in  which is called CAPTCHA art. I'm sure some of you have heard about it. Here's how it works. Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar  like this CAPTCHA.  Text  invisible toaster  Then what you're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it. Then of course  you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book. But then  first you take a screen shot  and then you draw something that is related to it. That's how it works. There are tens of thousands of these. Some of them are very cute.  Text  clenched it  Some of them are funnier. And some of them  like paleontological shvisle  they contain Snoop Dogg. Okay  so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA. So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project. This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA      million  which is a little over    percent of the world's population  has helped us digitize human knowledge. And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda. So the question that motivates my research is the following  If you look at humanity's large scale achievements  these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically    like for example  building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon    there is a curious fact about them  and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people. It's weird  they were all done with about         people. And the reason for that is because  before the Internet  coordinating more than         people  let alone paying them  was essentially impossible. But now with the Internet  I've just shown you a project where we've gotten     million people to help us digitize human knowledge. So the question that motivates my research is  if we can put a man on the Moon with          what can we do with     million  So based on this question  we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on. Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about. This is something that we've been semi quietly working on for the last year and a half or so. It hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo. Since it hasn't been launched  shhhhh  Yeah  I can trust you'll do that. So this is the project. Here's how it started. It started with me posing a question to my graduate student  Severin Hacker. Okay  that's Severin Hacker. So I posed the question to my graduate student. By the way  you did hear me correctly  his last name is Hacker. So I posed this question to him  How can we get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free  Okay  so there's a lot of things to say about this question. First of all  translating the Web. So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages. A large fraction of it is in English. If you don't know any English  you can't access it. But there's large fractions in other different languages  and if you don't know those languages  you can't access it. So I would like to translate all of the Web  or at least most of the Web  into every major language. So that's what I would like to do. Now some of you may say  why can't we use computers to translate  Why can't we use machine translation  Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there. Why can't we use it to translate the whole Web  Well the problem with that is that it's not yet good enough and it probably won't be for the next    to    years. It makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't make a mistake  since it makes so many mistakes  you don't know whether to trust it or not. So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine. Actually it was a forum post. It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript. It was translated from Japanese into English. So I'll just let you read. This person starts apologizing for the fact that it's translated with a computer. So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question. So he's just explaining something. Remember  it's a question about JavaScript. Then comes the first part of the question. Then comes my favorite part of the question. And then comes the ending  which is my favorite part of the whole thing. Okay  so computer translation  not yet good enough. So back to the question. So we need people to translate the whole Web. So now the next question you may have is  well why can't we just pay people to do this  We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web. We could do that. Unfortunately  it would be extremely expensive. For example  translating a tiny  tiny fraction of the whole Web  Wikipedia  into one other language  Spanish. Wikipedia exists in Spanish  but it's very small compared to the size of English. It's about    percent of the size of English. If we wanted to translate the other    percent into Spanish  it would cost at least    million dollars    and this is at even the most exploited  outsourcing country out there. So it would be very expensive. So what we want to do is we want to get     million people translating the Web into every major language for free. Now if this is what you want to do  you pretty quickly realize you're going to run into two pretty big hurdles  two big obstacles. The first one is a lack of bilinguals. So I don't even know if there exists     million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate. That's a big problem. The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation. How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free  Normally  you have to pay people to do this. So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free  Now when we were starting to think about this  we were blocked by these two things. But then we realized  there's actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution. There's a way to kill two birds with one stone. And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do  and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals  and that is language education. So it turns out that today  there are over  .  billion people learning a foreign language. People really  really want to learn a foreign language. And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school. For example  in the United States alone  there are over five million people who have paid over      for software to learn a new language. So people really  really want to learn a new language. So what we've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website    it's called Duolingo    where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web. And so basically they're learning by doing. So the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner  we give you very  very simple sentences. There's  of course  a lot of very simple sentences on the Web. We give you very  very simple sentences along with what each word means. And as you translate them  and as you see how other people translate them  you start learning the language. And as you get more and more advanced  we give you more and more complex sentences to translate. But at all times  you're learning by doing. Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works. First of all  people are really  really learning a language. We're mostly done building it  and now we're testing it. People really can learn a language with it. And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software. So people really do learn a language. And not only do they learn it as well  but actually it's way more interesting. Because you see with Duolingo  people are actually learning with real content. As opposed to learning with made up sentences  people are learning with real content  which is inherently interesting. So people really do learn a language. But perhaps more surprisingly  the translations that we get from people using the site  even though they're just beginners  the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators  which is very surprising. So let me show you one example. This is a sentence that was translated from German into English. The top is the German. The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid    cents a word for this translation. And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo  none of whom knew any German before they started using the site. You can see  it's pretty much perfect. Now of course  we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators. We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator. Now even though we're combining the translations  the site actually can translate pretty fast. So let me show you  this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish. Remember  this is    million dollars worth of value. So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish  we could do it in five weeks with         active users. And we could do it in about    hours with a million active users. Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users  we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project. Now the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education. So here's the thing  The current business model for language education is the student pays  and in particular  the student pays Rosetta Stone     dollars. That's the current business model. The problem with this business model is that    percent of the world's population doesn't have     dollars. So it's extremely unfair towards the poor. This is totally biased towards the rich. Now see  in Duolingo  because while you learn you're actually creating value  you're translating stuff    which for example  we could charge somebody for translations. So this is how we could monetize this. Since people are creating value while they're learning  they don't have to pay their money  they pay with their time. But the magical thing here is that they're paying with their time  but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language. So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model    one that doesn't discriminate against poor people. So here's the site. Thank you. So here's the site. We haven't yet launched  but if you go there  you can sign up to be part of our private beta  which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks. We haven't yet launched this Duolingo. By the way  I'm the one talking here  but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team  some of whom are here. So thank you. I'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them. Spiders are truly global citizens. You can find spiders in nearly every terrestrial habitat. This red dot marks the Great Basin of North America  and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators. Here's one of our field sites  and just to give you a sense of perspective  this little blue smudge here  that's one of my collaborators. This is a rugged and barren landscape  yet there are quite a few spiders here. Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle. Spiders are not just everywhere  but they're extremely diverse. There are over        described species of spiders. To put that number into perspective  here's a graph comparing the        species of spiders to the     species of primates. There are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates. Spiders are also extremely old. On the bottom here  this is the geologic timescale  and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present  so the zero here  that would be today. So what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost     million years. To put that into perspective  this red vertical bar here marks the divergence time of humans from chimpanzees  a mere seven million years ago. All spiders make silk at some point in their life. Most spiders use copious amounts of silk  and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction. Even fossil spiders can make silk  as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider. So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for     million years. It doesn't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life. Spiders use silk for many purposes  including the trailing safety dragline  wrapping eggs for reproduction  protective retreats and catching prey. There are many kinds of spider silk. For example  this garden spider can make seven different kinds of silks. When you look at this orb web  you're actually seeing many types of silk fibers. The frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk  while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks  the filament and the sticky droplet. How does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk  To answer that  you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider. So silk comes out of the spinnerets  and for those of us spider silk biologists  this is what we call the  business end  of the spider.  Laughter  We spend long days ... Hey  Don't laugh. That's my life. We spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider. And this is what we see. You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets  because each spinneret has many spigots on it. Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot  and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider  what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside. So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb web weaving spider  and I hope you do  what you would find is a bounty of beautiful  translucent silk glands. Inside each spider  there are hundreds of silk glands  sometimes thousands. These can be grouped into seven categories. They differ by size  shape  and sometimes even color. In an orb web weaving spider  you can find seven types of silk glands  and what I have depicted here in this picture  let's start at the one o'clock position  there's tubuliform silk glands  which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac. There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web. Pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement    that's the silk that's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate. There's also aciniform silk  which is used to wrap prey. Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction. And the most studied silk line of them all  major ampullate silk. This is the silk that's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web  and also the safety trailing dragline. But what  exactly  is spider silk  Spider silk is almost entirely protein. Nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family  so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family  so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk  and over the last     million years  that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged  specialized  over and over and over again  to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today. There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design  such as they're all very long    they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins. They're very repetitive  and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine. To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like  this is a dragline silk protein  it's just a portion of it  from the black widow spider. This is the kind of sequence that I love looking at day and night.  Laughter  So what you're seeing here is the one letter abbreviation for amino acids  and I've colored in the glycines with green  and the alanines in red  and so you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's. You can also see that there's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again  so for example there's a lot of what we call polyalanines  or iterated A's  AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY. You can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words  and these words occur in sentences. So for example this would be one sentence  and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine  that repeats over and over and over again  and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule. Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences. At the top of the screen  you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider. It's short. And on the bottom  this is the repeat sequence for the egg case  or tubuliform silk protein  for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are    so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family. You can see that the repeat units differ in length. They also differ in sequence. So I've colored in the glycines again in green  alanine in red  and the serines  the letter S  in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red  and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple. What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences  these amino acid sequences  to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers. Now  it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body. This makes testing spider silk really  really easy to do in the laboratory  because we're actually  you know  testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins. So this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing  which is basically  you know  tugging on one end of the fiber  very amenable. Here are stress strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider. So what you can see here is that the five fibers have different behaviors. Specifically  if you look on the vertical axis  that's stress. If you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers  you can see that there's a lot of variation  and in fact dragline  or major ampullate silk  is the strongest of these fibers. We think that's because the dragline silk  which is used to make the frame and radii for a web  needs to be very strong. On the other hand  if you were to look at strain    this is how much a fiber can be extended    if you look at the maximum value here  again  there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform  or the capture spiral filament. In fact  this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length. So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility. In the case of the capture spiral  it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey. If it wasn't able to stretch so much  then basically when an insect hit the web  it would just trampoline right off of it. So if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk  an insect is very likely to just bounce right off. But by having really  really stretchy capture spiral silk  the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey. There's quite a bit of variation within the fibers that an individual spider can make. We call that the tool kit of a spider. That's what the spider has to interact with their environment. But how about variation among spider species  so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders  This is an area that's largely unexplored but here's a little bit of data I can show you. This is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by    species of spiders. Some of them are orb weaving spiders and some of them are non orb weaving spiders. It's been hypothesized that orb weaving spiders  like this argiope here  should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey. What you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph  the higher the toughness. The    species are indicated here by this phylogeny  this evolutionary tree  that shows their genetic relationships  and I've colored in yellow the orb web weaving spiders. If you look right here at the two red arrows  they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus. These are the two species of spiders for which the vast majority of time and money on synthetic spider silk research has been to replicate their dragline silk proteins. Yet  their draglines are not the toughest. In fact  the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region  a non orb web weaving spider. This is the dragline spun by scytodes  the spitting spider. Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead  scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it  and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk like venom onto that insect. Think of hunting with silly string. That's how scytodes forages. We don't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline  but it's unexpected results like this that make bio prospecting so exciting and worthwhile. It frees us from the constraints of our imagination. Now I'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber  bombyx    or domesticated silkworm silk    wool  Kevlar  and carbon fibers. And what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them. It's the combination of strength  extensibility and toughness that makes spider silk so special  and that has attracted the attention of biomimeticists  so people that turn to nature to try to find new solutions. And the strength  extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response  have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications  for example  as a component of artificial tendons  for serving as guides to regrow nerves  and for scaffolds for tissue growth. Spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities. Silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today. In addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks  personally  I find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself. I love when I'm in the laboratory  a new spider silk sequence comes in. That's just the best.  Laughter  It's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me  and that's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk. The next time you see a spider web  please  pause and look a little closer. You'll be seeing one of the most high performance materials known to man. To borrow from the writings of a spider named Charlotte  silk is terrific. Thank you.  Applause  Over the last    years    one  three     years    I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea  this concept  noninvasive surgery  from the research lab to routine clinical use. And this is what I'll tell you about.    years    for some of you  you can empathize with that number. For me  today  on this date  it's like a second bar mitzvah experience. So this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies. One is the focused ultrasound  and the other one is the vision enabled magnetic resonance imaging. So let's first talk about focused ultrasound. And I hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom. It is made out of silicon. It is transparent  made just for you. So you see  it's all intact  completely transparent. I'll take you now to the acoustic lab. You see the phantom within the aquarium. This is a setup I put in a physics lab. On the right hand side  you see an ultrasonic transducer. So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom. Okay  when you hear the click  this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom. Okay  so everything around it is whole and intact. It's just a lesion formed inside. So think about  this is in your brain. We need to reach a target inside the brain. We can do it without harming any tissue. So this is  I think  the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system. Okay  so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound  the force of ultrasound. You know all about imaging  right  ultrasound imaging. And you know also about lithotripsy    breaking kidney stones. But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between  because it's a mechanical force. Basically  it's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses. So you can change the intensity  the frequency  the duration  the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer. And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing  physically focusing. So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all. When I was born  this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the Fry brothers and Lars Leksell  who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife. But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain  noninvasively  with focused ultrasound in the '  s. He failed  so he then invented the gammaknife. And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed. And there was something fundamental that they were missing. They were missing the vision. It wasn't until the invention of the MR and really the integration of MR with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback    both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive  closed loop surgical procedure. So this is how it looks  you know  the operating room of the future today. This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system. And I will give you several examples. So the first one is in the brain. One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders  like Parkinson's or essential tremor. What is typical to those conditions  to essential tremor for example  is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you  or write legibly so people can understand it  and be really independent in your life without the help of others. So I'd like you to meet John. John is a retired professor of history from Virginia. So he suffered from essential tremor for many years. And medication didn't help him anymore. And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain. And about four or five months ago  he underwent an experimental procedure. It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus. And this is his handwriting.  On June   th   if you can read it       .  This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I'll take you through  what  a typical procedure like that looks like   what  noninvasive surgery looks like. So we put the patient on the MR table. We attach a transducer  in this case  to the brain  but if it will be a different organ  it will be a different transducer attached to the patient. And the physician will then take a regular MR scan. And the objective of that  I don't have a pointer here  but you see the green  sort of rectangle or trapezoid  This is the sort of general area of the treatment. It's a safety boundary around the target. It's a target in the thalamus. So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on  he selects basically a point    you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is    and he presses this blue button called  sonicate.  We call this instance of injecting the energy  we call it sonication. The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse. This is the only device he needs in this treatment. So he presses  sonicate   and this is what happens. You see the transducer  the light blue. There's water in between the skull and the transducer. And it does this burst of energy. It elevates the temperature. We first need to verify that we are on target. So the first sonication is at lower energy. It doesn't do any damage  but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees. And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively. This is really a unique capability of the MR. It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging. But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time. And you can see the points there on the graph. The temperature was raised to    degrees C temporarily. This doesn't cause any damage. But the point is we are right on target. So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen  then we move to perform a full energy ablation like you see here. And you see the temperature rises to like    to    degrees C. If you do it for more than a second  it's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells. This is the outcome from a patient perspective    same day after the treatment. This is an immediate relief. Thank you. John is one of  about  a dozen very heroic  courageous people who volunteered for the study. And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk. And this is a quote from John after he wrote it. He said   Miraculous.  And his wife said   This is the happiest moment of my life.  And you wonder why. I mean  one of the messages I like to carry over is  what about defending quality of life  I mean  those people lose their independence. They are dependent on others. And John today is fully independent. He returned to a normal life routine. And he also plays golf  like you do in Virginia when you are retired. Okay  so you can see here the spot. It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain. There's no damage outside. He suffers from no neurodeficit. There's no recovery needed  no nothing. He's back to his normal life. Let's move now to a more painful subject. Pain is something that can make your life miserable. And people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain  lower back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases  when the metastases get to your bones  sometimes they are very painful. All those I've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain  again  very fast. And I would like to tell you about PJ. He's a    year old farmer who suffered from    how should I say it     it's called pain in the butt. He had metastases in his right buttock  and he couldn't sit even with medication. He had to forgo all the farm activities. He was treated with radiation therapy  state of the art radiation therapy  but it didn't help. Many patients like that favor radiation therapy. And again  he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide  also in the U.S. And his wife actually took him. They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital. He had to sit on a cushion  stand still  not move  because it was very painful. He took the treatment  and on the way back  he drove the truck by himself. So again  this is an immediate relief. And you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens. He returned again to his daily routine on the farm. He rides his tractor. He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly. And he has been very happy. But now  you ask me  but what about war  the war on cancer  Show us some primary cancer. What can be done there  So I have good news and bad news. The good news  there's a lot that can be done. And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S. And doing that in the U.S. is very painful. I don't see  without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen  it will not happen. And it's not just because of regulation  it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen. So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer. They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound. And we have better than surgery results in breasts. But I have a message for the men here. We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer. There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR  because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy    treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland  and by that  avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence. Well  there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen    quite lethal  very lethal actually    pancreas  liver  kidney. The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient    and in all our treatments  the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician    is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time. And this will take time. This will take two years. But I have now a message to the ladies. And this is  in       the FDA has approved MR guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. Women suffer from that disease. All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods  abdominal pressure  back pain  frequent urination. And sometimes  they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid. This is Frances. She was diagnosed with a grapefruit sized fibroid. This is a big fibroid. She was offered a hysterectomy  but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option. So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in     . And in       she became a first time mother to a healthy baby. So new life was born. So in conclusion  I'd like to leave you with actually four messages. One is  think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery  and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large    and I think also from their physicians  by the way. And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table  who  is awake and can even monitor the treatment. In all our treatments  the patient holds a stop sonication button. He can stop the surgery at any moment. And with that note  I would like to thank you for listening. Okay  I have no idea what we're going to play. I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens. I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before. So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard. Okay  so first of all  let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums  Burniss Travis on the bass  and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano. So the bandstand  as we call it  this is an incredible space. It is really a sacred space. And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future  or the past. You really are alive right here in this moment. There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand. We had no idea what key we were going to play in. In the middle  we sort of made our way into a song called  Titi Boom.  But that could have happened    maybe  maybe not. Everyone's listening. We're responding. You have no time for projected ideas. So the idea of a mistake  From the perspective of a jazz musician  it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake. So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand    first of all  we don't really see it as a mistake. The only mistake lies in that I'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did. Every  mistake  is an opportunity in jazz. So it's hard to even describe what a funny note would be. So for example  if I played a color  like we were playing on a palette  that sounded like this ... So if Christian played a note    like play an F. See  these are all right inside of the color palette. If you played an E. See  these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting. If you played an F  though  to most people's ears  they would perceive that as a mistake. So I'm going to show you  we're going to play just for a second. And we're going to play on this palette. And at some point  Christian will introduce this note. And we won't react to it. He'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop  I'll talk for a second. We'll see what happens when we play with this palette. So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake. The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it. It was an opportunity that was missed. So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again. He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it  but something will change. We'll all accept his ideas  or not. So you see  he played this note. I ended up creating a melody out of it. The texture changed in the drums this time. It got a little bit more rhythmic  a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it. So there is no mistake. The only mistake is if I'm not aware  if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity. So jazz  this bandstand is absolutely amazing. It's a very purifying experience. And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted. We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing. So how does this all relate to behavioral finance  Well we're jazz musicians  so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance. Anyway  I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it. And the other dynamic of it is that we don't micromanage in jazz. You have some people who do. But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities. If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way  and I just jump right in ... ready  just play some time. One  two  one  two  three  four. It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas. I'm telling them   You come with me over this way.  If I really want the music to go there  the best way for me to do it is to listen. This is a science of listening. It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do. So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity  the first step for me is to be patient  to listen to what's going on and pull from something that's going on around me. When you do that  you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more  and gradually it builds. Watch. One  two  a one  two  three  four. Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas. It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced. It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that. It's about being here in the moment  accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow. Thank you. My travels to Afghanistan began many  many years ago on the eastern border of my country  my homeland  Poland. I was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales. A land where every field hides a grave  where millions of people have been deported or killed in the   th century. Behind the destruction  I found a soul of places. I met humble people. I heard their prayer and ate their bread. Then I have been walking East for    years    from Eastern Europe to Central Asia    through the Caucasus Mountains  Middle East  North Africa  Russia. And I ever met more humble people. And I shared their bread and their prayer. This is why I went to Afghanistan. One day  I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River. I was alone on foot. And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport. But he gave me a cup of tea. And I understood that his surprise was my protection. So I have been walking and traveling  by horses  by yak  by truck  by hitchhiking  from Iran's border to the bottom  to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor. And in this way I could find noor  the hidden light of Afghanistan. My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica. I heard prayers of the Sufi    humble Muslims  hated by the Taliban. Hidden river  interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India. The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears  and welcomed as a gift. What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect  about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium  These are opium addicted people on the roofs of Kabul    years after the beginning of our war. These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen. What do we know about the women    years after the war  Clothed in this nylon bag  made in China  with the name of burqa. I saw one day  the largest school in Afghanistan  a girls' school.        girls studying here in the rooms underground  full of scorpions. And their love  for studying  was so big that I cried. What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh  The region is not secure  but full of the Taliban  and they did it. My aim is to give a voice to the silent people  to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game  the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict. Thanks. I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine  and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved. Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single  solo inventor who  working late in the lab one night  makes an earthshaking discovery  and voila  overnight everything's changed. That's a very appealing picture  however  it's just not true. In fact  medicine today is a team sport. And in many ways  it always has been. I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work. I'm a surgeon  and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light. When I make an incision inside a patient's body  it's dark. We need to shine light to see what we're doing. And this is why  traditionally  surgeries have always started so early in the morning    to take advantage of daylight hours. And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms  they have been on top of buildings. For example  this is the oldest operating room in the Western world  in London  where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in. And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America. This is Mass General in Boston. And do you know where the operating room is  Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in. So nowadays in the operating room  we no longer need to use sunlight. And because we no longer need to use sunlight  we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room. We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights    lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see. And this is what I think is the magic of fluorescence. So let me back up a little bit. When we are in medical school  we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything's color coded. Nerves are yellow  arteries are red  veins are blue. That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon  right  However  when we have a real patient on the table  this is the same neck dissection    not so easy to tell the difference between different structures. We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society  what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute. Well if cancer can be caught early  enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out  excised with surgery  I don't care if it has this gene or that gene  or if it has this protein or that protein  it's in the jar. It's done  it's out  you're cured of cancer. This is how we excise cancers. We do our best  based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience  we say  you know what  the cancer's gone. We've made a good job. We've taken it out. That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table. But then we actually don't know that it's all out. We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed  what's left behind in the patient  and then send those bits to the pathology lab. In the meanwhile  the patient's on the operating room table. The nurses  anesthesiologist  the surgeon  all the assistants are waiting around. And we wait. The pathologist takes that sample  freezes it  cuts it  looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room. And that may be    minutes later per piece. So if you've sent three specimens  it's an hour later. And very often they say   You know what  points A and B are okay  but point C  you still have some residual cancer there. Please go cut that piece out.  So we go back and we do that again  and again. And this whole process   Okay you're done. We think the entire tumor is out.  But very often several days later  the patient's gone home  we get a phone call   I'm sorry  once we looked at the final pathology  once we looked at the final specimen  we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive. There's still cancer in your patient.  So now you're faced with telling your patient  first of all  that they may need another surgery  or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy. So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell  if the surgeon could really tell  whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field  I mean  in many ways  the way that we're doing it  we're still operating in the dark. So in       during my surgical residency  I had the great fortune to meet Dr. Roger Tsien  who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry in     . Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer  and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with. The molecule they had developed had three parts. The main part of it is the blue part  polycation  and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body. So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer  everything's going to get lit up. Nothing will be specific. There's no specificity there. So they added two additional components. The first one is a polyanionic segment  which basically acts as a non stick backing like the back of a sticker. So when those two are together  the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down. And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors    for example  the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make. So here in this situation  if you make a solution full of this three part molecule along with the dye  which is shown in green  and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer  normal tissue can't cut it. The molecule passes through and gets excreted. However  in the presence of the tumor  now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site. And now  boom  the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent. So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it. Can you tell where the tumor is  I couldn't when I was working on this. But here it is. It's fluorescent. Now it's green. See  so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is. We can tell in the operating room  in the field  at a molecular level  where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out. And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright  it actually can shine through tissue. The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue. So even if the tumor is not right on the surface  you'll still be able to see it. In this movie  you can see that the tumor is green. There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that  And I'm peeling that muscle away. But even before I peel that muscle away  you saw that there was a tumor underneath. So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules. That you can  not only see the margins right there on a molecular level  but you can see it even if it's not right on the top    even if it's beyond your field of view. And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also. Sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer  melanoma. Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes. But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol  the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer. And then if that node has cancer  the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection. So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer  the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery. But sentinel lymph node  the way that we do it today  is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go. So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station  you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road. It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas. You have to cut it out  bring it back home  cut it up  look inside and say   Oh yes  it does have gas.  So that takes more time. Patients are still on the operating room table. Anesthesiologists  surgeons are waiting around. That takes time. So with our technology  we can tell right away. You see a lot of little  roundish bumps there. Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others. Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold  That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside. Well with our technology  the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer. I won't go into this very much  but our technology  besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence  we can also use the same smart three part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively. The patient has cancer  you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in. Well you can see this on an MRI. So in surgery  it's important to know what to cut out. But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function. So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury. And what I'm talking about are nerves. Nerves  if they are injured  can cause paralysis  can cause pain. In the setting of prostate cancer  up to    percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction. That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems    and this is even in so called nerve sparing surgery  which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem  and they are trying to avoid the nerves. But you know what  these little nerves are so small  in the context of prostate cancer  that they are actually never seen. They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature. And they're known because somebody has decided to study them  which means that we're still learning about where they are. Crazy to think that we're having surgery  we're trying to excise cancer  we don't know where the cancer is. We're trying to preserve nerves  we can't see where they are. So I said  wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence  And at first this didn't get a lot of support. People said   We've been doing it this way for all these years. What's the problem  We haven't had that many complications.  But I went ahead anyway. And Roger helped me. And he brought his whole team with him. So there's that teamwork thing again. And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves. And when we made a solution of this  tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse  their nerves literally glowed. You can see where they are. Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse  and you can see that that big  fat portion you can see very easily. But in fact  at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now  there's actually very fine arborizations that can't really be seen. You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out. We have been able to see nerves for facial expression  for facial movement  for breathing    every single nerve    nerves for urinary function around the prostate. We've been able to see every single nerve. When we put these two probes together ... So here's a tumor. Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is  Now you do. What about the nerve that's going into this tumor  That white portion there is easy to see. But what about the part that goes into the tumor  Do you know where it's going  Now you do. Basically  we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field. This was a bit of a breakthrough. I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery. We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology. We received commentary in Discover magazine  in The Economist. And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues. They said   Wow  I have patients who would benefit from this. I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications.  What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room. The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients. However  we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one time use. Understandably  the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple use drugs  such as long term daily medications. We are focused on making this technology better. We're focused on adding drugs  adding growth factors  killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue. We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it. I'd like to leave you with this final thought. Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough. It is not a sprint. It is not an event for the solo runner. Successful innovation is a team sport  it's a relay race. It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted. And this takes the long term steady courage of the day in day out struggle to educate  to persuade and to win acceptance. And that is the light that I want to shine on health and medicine today. Thank you very much. I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature. The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet  so those invoices don't get issued. But we need to do something about this problem. I began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest  but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature  and which doesn't get priced by the markets. A project called TEEB was started in       and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G   . And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern. They asked themselves a question  If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change  well why can't the same be done for conservation  Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature  And the answer is  Yeah  it can. But it's not that straightforward. Biodiversity  the living fabric of this planet  is not a gas. It exists in many layers  ecosystems  species and genes across many scales    international  national  local  community    and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy. And yet  we began. We began the project with an interim report  which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many  many researchers. And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that  in fact  we were losing natural capital    the benefits that flow from nature to us. We were losing it at an extraordinary rate    in fact  of the order of two to four trillion dollars worth of natural capital. This came out in       which was  of course  around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars. So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss. We then have gone on since to present for  the  international community  for governments  for local governments and for business and for people  for you and me  a whole slew of reports  which were presented at the U.N. last year  which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it. What is this about  A picture that you're familiar with    the Amazon rainforests. It's a massive store of carbon  it's an amazing store of biodiversity  but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory. Because the northeastern trade winds  as they go over the Amazonas  effectively gather the water vapor. Something like    billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds  and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin. This rainfall cycle  this rainfall factory  effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of     billion dollars worth in Latin America. But the question arises  Okay  so how much do Uruguay  Paraguay  Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas  which produces that rainfall  And the answer is zilch  exactly zero. That's the economic invisibility of nature. That can't keep going on  because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful. Economics has become the currency of policy. And unless we address this invisibility  we are going to get the results that we are seeing  which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset. It's not just about the Amazonas  or indeed about rainforests. No matter what level you look at  whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level  we see the same problem again and again. So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level. At the species level  it's been estimated that insect based pollination  bees pollinating fruit and so on  is something like     billion dollars worth. That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally. It completely passes below the radar screen. But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice  Or for that matter  if you look at the genetic level     percent of medicines were prospected  were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef. Once again  most of that doesn't get paid. And that brings me to another aspect of this  which is  to whom should this get paid  That genetic material probably belonged  if it could belong to anyone  to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule  which then became the medicine. They were the ones that didn't get paid. And if you look at the species level  you saw about fish. Today  the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor  the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods  to feed their families. Something like a billion people depend on fish  the quantity of fish in the oceans. A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein. And at this rate at which we are losing fish  it is a human problem of enormous dimensions  a health problem of a kind we haven't seen before. And finally  at the ecosystem level  whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests  or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats  or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest  it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services. We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil  India and Indonesia  even though ecosystem services    these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free    they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP    two  four  eight         percent    but in these countries  if we measure how much they're worth to the poor  the answers are more like    percent     percent     percent. That's the difference. Because these are important benefits for the poor. And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset  the most important asset  which is your development asset  that is ecological infrastructure. How bad can things get  Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance. It's basically a measure of how many tigers  toads  ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around. The green represents the percentage. If you start green  it's like    to     percent. If it's yellow  it's    to    percent. And these are percentages versus the original state  so to speak  the pre industrial era      . Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this. And just watch the change in colors in India  China  Europe  sub Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us. See that again. The only places that remain green    and that's not good news    is  in fact  places like the Gobi Desert  like the tundra and like the Sahara. But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place. This is the challenge. The reason this is happening boils down  in my mind  to one basic problem  which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits. We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth  it's common goods. And here's an example from Thailand where we found that  because the value of a mangrove is not that much    it's about      over the life of nine years that this has been measured    compared to its value as a shrimp farm  which is more like         there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms. But of course  if you look at exactly what those profits are  almost       of those dollars are  in fact  subsidies. So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like       to    . That's not that hard. But on the other hand  if you start measuring  how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use  Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects  that answer is more like         of cost. And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries  the fish nurseries  that provide fish for the poor  that answer is more like        . So now look at the different lens. If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits  you get a completely different answer  which is clearly conservation makes more sense  and not destruction. So is this just a story from South Thailand  Sorry  this is a global story. And here's what the same calculation looks like  which was done recently    well I say recently  over the last    years    by a group called TRUCOST. And they calculated for the top       corporations  what are the externalities  In other words  what are the costs of doing business as usual  This is not illegal stuff  this is basically business as usual  which causes climate changing emissions  which have an economic cost. It causes pollutants being issued  which have an economic cost  health cost and so on. Use of freshwater. If you drill water to make coke near a village farm  that's not illegal  but yes  it costs the community. Can we stop this  and how  I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital. Basically the stuff of life is natural capital  and we need to recognize and build that into our systems. When we measure GDP as a measure of economic performance at the national level  we don't include our biggest asset at the country level. When we measure corporate performances  we don't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society. That has to stop. In fact  this was what really inspired my interest in this phase. I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project. That was in the early     s when India was going gung ho about GDP growth as the means forward    looking at China with its stellar growths of eight  nine     percent and wondering  why can we do the same  And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense. This is going to create more cost to society and more losses. So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states. That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project. Calculating this at the national level is one thing  and it has begun. And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES    Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services. But calculating this at the next level  that means at the business sector level  is important. And actually we've done this with the TEEB project. We've done this for a very difficult case  which was for deforestation in China. This is important  because in China in       the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society. Just a year later the Yangtze flooded  causing something like       deaths. So clearly there was a problem with deforestation. It was associated largely with the construction industry. And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling. A retrospective on    years shows that if we had accounted for these costs    the cost of loss of topsoil  the cost of loss of waterways  the lost productivity  the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors  desertification and so on    those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber. So in fact  the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China. Of course  after the event one can be wise. The way to do this is to do it on a company basis  to take leadership forward  and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost  and to disclose these answers. Someone once asked me   Who is better or worse  is it Unilever or is it P G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia   And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies  good though they are and professional though they are  do not calculate or disclose their externalities. But if we look at companies like PUMA    Jochen Zeitz  their CEO and chairman  once challenged me at a function  saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it. Well I think we kind of did it at the same time  but he's done it. He's basically worked the cost to PUMA. PUMA has  .  billion dollars of turnover      million dollars of profits      million dollars after tax     million dollars of externalities  cost to business. Now that's not a happy situation for them  but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say   Here's what we are measuring. We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure.  That's an example  I think  for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from. If more companies did this  and if more sectors engaged this as sectors  you could have analysts  business analysts  and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs actually look and compare the social performance of companies. Today we can't yet do that  but I think the path is laid out. This can be done. And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K. has already set up a coalition to do this  an international coalition. The other favorite  if you like  solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets. And by the way  these are my favorites    externalities calculation and green carbon markets. TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco certification and you name it  but these are the favorites. What's green carbon  Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace. It's about energy emissions. The European Union ETS is the main marketplace. It's not doing too well. We've over issued. A bit like inflation  you over issue currency  you get what you see  declining prices. But that's all about energy and industry. But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon  that is soot. What we're also missing is blue carbon  which  by the way  is the largest store of carbon    more than    percent. Thankfully  the flux  in other words  the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa  is more or less balanced. In fact  what's being absorbed is something like    percent of our emissions  which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans. More of that in a minute. And finally  there's deforestation  and there's emission of methane from agriculture. Green carbon  which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions  and blue carbon together comprise    percent of our emissions. We have the means already in our hands  through a structure  through a mechanism  called REDD Plus    a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme. So we actually have some movement forward. But the thing is to do a lot more of that. Will this solve the problem  Will economics solve everything  Well I'm afraid not. There is an area that is the oceans  coral reefs. As you can see  they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia  Malaysia  India  Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean. These red dots  these red areas  basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people. So that's almost an eighth of society. And the sad thing is that  as these coral reefs are lost    and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above     parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs    we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species  the warm water corals  we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans  but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than     million people who live in the developing world in poor countries. So in selecting targets of     parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations  what we have done is we've made an ethical choice. We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs. Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that. Let's think about it and what it means  but please  let's not do more of that. Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital. I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices. Thank you. Ben Roche  So I'm Ben  by the way. Homaro Cantu  And I'm Homaro. BR  And we're chefs. So when Moto opened in       people didn't really know what to expect. A lot of people thought that it was a Japanese restaurant  and maybe it was the name  maybe it was the logo  which was like a Japanese character  but anyway  we had all these requests for Japanese food  which is really not what we did. And after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll  we decided to give the people what they wanted. So this picture is an example of printed food  and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation. So this is all the ingredients  all the flavor of  you know  a standard maki roll  printed onto a little piece of paper. HC  So our diners started to get bored with this idea  and we decided to give them the same course twice  so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish. So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood. The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some cr me fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish.  Laughter  BR  But it's not all just edible pictures. We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar    so in this case  we have carrot cake. So we take a carrot cake  put it in a blender  and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice  and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream  I guess  and it comes off looking like  you know  Jupiter's floating around your plate. So yeah  we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for. HC  And here's something we have no reference to eat. This is a cigar  and basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of a Cuban pork sandwich  so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder  we fashion that into ash. We take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green  put an edible label that bears no similarity to a Cohiba cigar label  and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it.  Laughter  HC  Delicious. BR  That's not it  though. Instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn't eat  we decided to make ingredients look like dishes that you know. So this is a plate of nachos. The difference between our nachos and the other guy's nachos  is that this is actually a dessert. So the chips are candied  the ground beef is made from chocolate  and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese. And after doing all of this dematerialization and reconfiguring of this  of these ingredients  we realized that it was pretty cool  because as we served it  we learned that the dish actually behaves like the real thing  where the cheese begins to melt. So when you're looking at this thing in the dining room  you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos  and it's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert  and it's just kind of like a mind ripper. HC  So we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic's shop than a kitchen  and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory  and that's what we have here. So we put this in the basement  and we got really serious about food  like serious experimentation. BR  One of the really cool things about the lab  besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen  is that  you know  with this new equipment  and this new approach  all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open  and so the experiments and the food and the dishes that we created  they just kept going further and further out there. HC  Let's talk about flavor transformation  and let's actually make some cool stuff. You see a cow with its tongue hanging out. What I see is a cow about to eat something delicious. What is that cow eating  And why is it delicious  So the cow  basically  eats three basic things in their feed  corn  beets  and barley  and so what I do is I actually challenge my staff with these crazy  wild ideas. Can we take what the cow eats  remove the cow  and then make some hamburgers out of that  And basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  that's our chef de cuisine  Chris Jones. This is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task  but a lot of these ideas  they're hard to understand. They're hard to just get automatically. There's a lot of research and a lot of failure  trial and error    I guess  more error    that goes into each and every dish  so we don't always get it right  and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people. HC  So  after about a day of Chris and I staring at each other  we came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty  and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat. This is made from three ingredients  beets  barley  corn  and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat  looks and tastes like hamburger meat  and not only that  but it's basically removing the cow from the equation. So replicating food  taking it into that next level is where we're going. BR  And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger  which is a cool side effect. And a miracle berry  if you're not familiar with it  is a natural ingredient  and it contains a special property. It's a glycoprotein called miraculin  a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it  but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue  so that primarily sour taste receptors  so normally things that would taste very sour or tart  somehow begin to taste very sweet. HC  You're about to eat a lemon  and now it tastes like lemonade. Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that. We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas  and we can replace it with all natural fresh fruit. BR  So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles  wasted energy  and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna  or any exotic produce or item from a very far away place  with local  organic produce  so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin. HC  So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things  we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon  and it makes it go from sweet to savory. So after we do that  we put it into a vacuum bag  add a little bit of seaweed  some spices  and we roll it  and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna. So the key now is to make it behave like tuna. BR  And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear  we really have something that looks  tastes and behaves like the real thing. HC  So the key thing to remember here is  we don't really care what this tuna really is. As long as it's good for you and good for the environment  it doesn't matter. But where is this going  How can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology  So here's the next challenge. I told the staff  let's just take a bunch of wild plants  think of them as food ingredients. As long as they're non poisonous to the human body  go out around Chicago sidewalks  take it  blend it  cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at Moto. Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think.  Laughter  BR  Yeah  so you can imagine  a task like this    this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for. But we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general  because these are ingredients  you know  plant life that we're  one  unfamiliar with  and two  we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don't eat them. So we really had to think about new  creative ways to flavor  new ways to cook and to change texture    and that was the main issue with this challenge. HC  So this is where we step into the future and we leapfrog ahead. So developing nations and first world nations  imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them  food miles would basically turn into food feet. This disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are  even if we just swapped out  say  one of these for flour  that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste. And to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers  there's a bale of hay there and some crab apples. And basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients. People swore they were eating barbecue sauce  and this is free food. BR  Thanks  guys. I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than    years. So bear with me as I take you through this journey. When I was    years old  I came home from work  put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run. I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever. While I was preparing my dog for the run  a man was finishing drinking at a bar  picked up his car keys  got into a car and headed south  or wherever he was. I was running across the street  and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head. And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth. What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog. She ended up underneath the car. I flew out in front of the car  and then he ran over my legs. My left leg got caught up in the wheel well    spun it around. The bumper of the car hit my throat  slicing it open. I ended up with blunt chest trauma. Your aorta comes up behind your heart. It's your major artery  and it was severed  so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth. It foamed  and horrible things were happening to me. I had no idea what was going on  but strangers intervened  kept my heart moving  beating. I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it. Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there. And my lung collapsed  so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening. Somehow I ended up at the hospital. I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug induced coma.    months later I woke up. I was blind  I couldn't speak  and I couldn't walk. I was    lbs. The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that. And in fact  they started to call me a Gomer. That's another story we won't even get into. I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together  to repair my heart a few times. Some things worked  some things didn't. I had lots of titanium put in me  cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way. And I ended up with a plastic nose  porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things. But eventually I started to look human again. But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things  so bear with me. I had more than    surgeries. But who's counting  So eventually  the hospital decided it was time for me to go. They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through. Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover. So they basically put a map up on the wall  threw a dart  and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado. And I know all of you are scratching your head   A senior citizens' home  What in the world are you going to do there   But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now  that's what a senior home has. So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had. The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom  because they had a long life. And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life. But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep  At that point  I had gained four pounds  so I was    lbs. I was bald. I was wearing hospital scrubs. And somebody donated tennis shoes for me. And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand. And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting. So they pulled back and they were looking at each other  and they were going   Okay  what skills do we have in this room  This kid needs a lot of work.  So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs. But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away. I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being  since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins. So I had to go through trying to eat again. And they went through that process. And then they had to figure out   Well she needs furniture. She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment.  So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture    gave me pots and pans  blankets  everything. And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover. So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints. We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back. But I did say no to the blue hair. So eventually what went on is they decided that  well I need to learn to speak. So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see. So they figured not being able to see is one thing  but they need to get me to talk. So while Sally  the office manager  was teaching me to speak in the day    it's hard  because when you're a kid  you take things for granted. You learn things unconsciously. But for me  I was an adult and it was embarrassing  and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips  and capture the air and get the word out. So I acted like a two year old and refused to work. But the men had a better idea. They were going to make it fun for me. So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night  and then  secretly  how to swear like a sailor. So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built. So I moved on from there. And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write. The redundancy was actually good for me. So we'll just keep moving on. One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person. So close your eyes. Now imagine you have to cross a street. You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth  and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation. So there were two obstacles I had to get through. One was post traumatic stress disorder. And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic. And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street. So one of the seniors just came up to me  and she pushed me up to the corner and she said   When you think it's time to go  just stick the cane out there. If it's hit  don't cross the street.  Made perfect sense. But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road  they realized that they needed to put the resources together  and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person  and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life. And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me  and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.    years later I gained my sight back. Not magically. I opted in for three surgeries  and one of them was experimental. It was actually robotic surgery. They removed a hematoma from behind my eye. The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward  that there were innovations and all kinds of new things    cellphones  laptops  all these things that I had never seen before. And as a blind person  your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell. So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster. So I was walking around it. And I go   I'm just going to touch it.  And I touched it and I went   Oh my God  it's a laundry basket.  So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted. But when you're blind  you have the tactile memory for things. The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost    years of my life. I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends. But when I looked down  I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up  so I got going on it. We didn't have words like crowd sourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident. But the concept held true    people working with people to rebuild me  people working with people to re educate me. I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration. Thank you so much. I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds. The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind. We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence  yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder. We should  in fact  because without having this possibility of conscious minds  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity  we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world. We would have no pains  but also no joys. We would have no access to love or to the ability to create. And of course  Scott Fitzgerald said famously that  he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for.  But he also forgot that without consciousness  he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence. So much for the wonder  now for the mystery. This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate. All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience  this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation  has got major controversies. And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it  we should just leave it alone  it's not to be solved. I don't believe that  and I think the situation is changing. It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains  but we certainly can begin to approach the question  and we can begin to see the shape of a solution. And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do  for example  what you're seeing right now. These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab  and which show you  in a living brain  the reconstruction of that brain. And this is a person who is alive. This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy. And even more    and this is something that one can be really amazed about    is what I'm going to show you next  which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections  real pathways. So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons  the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses. And I'm sorry to disappoint you  they don't come in color. But at any rate  they are there. The colors are codes for the direction  from whether it is back to front or vice versa. At any rate  what is consciousness  What is a conscious mind  And we could take a very simple view and say  well  it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams  or when we go under anesthesia  and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia. But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia  or when we are in deep  dreamless sleep  Well first of all  it is a mind  which is a flow of mental images. And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns  visual  such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me  or auditory images  as you are having now in relation to my words. That flow of mental images is mind. But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room. We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images. We have selves. We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now. We own our minds. And we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this    not the person who is sitting next to you. So in order to have a conscious mind  you have a self within the conscious mind. So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it. The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind  and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind. So what we need to know to even address this mystery is  number one  how are minds are put together in the brain  and  number two  how selves are constructed. Now the first part  the first problem  is relatively easy    it's not easy at all    but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience. And it's quite clear that  in order to make minds  we need to construct neural maps. So imagine a grid  like the one I'm showing you right now  and now imagine  within that grid  that two dimensional sheet  imagine neurons. And picture  if you will  a billboard  a digital billboard  where you have elements that can be either lit or not. And depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting  the digital elements  or  for that matter  the neurons in the sheet  you're going to be able to construct a map. This  of course  is a visual map that I'm showing you  but this applies to any kind of map    auditory  for example  in relation to sound frequencies  or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate. Now to bring home the point of how close it is    the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience    I'm going to tell you a personal story. So if I cover my left eye    I'm talking about me personally  not all of you    if I cover my left eye  I look at the grid    pretty much like the one I'm showing you. Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular. But sometime ago  I discovered that if I cover my left eye  instead what I get is this. I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central left field. Very odd    I've analyzed this for a while. But sometime ago  through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine  Carmen Puliafito  who developed a laser scanner of the retina  I found out the the following. If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner  what I get is the following. On the right side  my retina is perfectly symmetrical. You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins. But on my left retina there is a bump  which is marked there by the red arrow. And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below. And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image. So just think of this  you have a grid of neurons  and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid  and you get a warping of your mental experience. So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina  which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball  or  for that matter  a sheet of visual cortex. So from the retina you go onto visual cortex. And of course  the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina. And in that image there  you see a variety of islands of what I call image making regions in the brain. You have the green for example  that corresponds to tactile information  or the blue that corresponds to auditory information. And something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps  can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around  which is the association cortex  where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making. And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory  out of those association cortices  and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception. So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is. So it provides certain areas for perception and image making. And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information. So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images. But what about the self  The self is really the elusive problem. And for a long time  people did not even want to touch it  because they'd say   How can you have this reference point  this stability  that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day   And I thought about a solution to this problem. It's the following. We generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps. So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this. I came to this because  if you're going to have a reference that we know as self    the Me  the I in our own processing    we need to have something that is stable  something that does not deviate much from day to day. Well it so happens that we have a singular body. We have one body  not two  not three. And so that is a beginning. There is just one reference point  which is the body. But then  of course  the body has many parts  and things grow at different rates  and they have different sizes and different people  however  not so with the interior. The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu    for example  the whole management of the chemistries within our body are  in fact  extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason. If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life permitting survival range  you go into disease or death. So we have an in built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity. I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day. Because if you don't have that sameness  physiologically  you're going to be sick or you're going to die. So that's one more element for this continuity. And the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself  unlike any other coupling. So for example  I'm making images of you  but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain. However  there is a close  permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body. So here's how it looks. Look at the region there. There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life regulation devices of the body. This is so specific that  for example  if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem  if you damage that as a result of a stroke  for example  what you get is coma or vegetative state  which is a state  of course  in which your mind disappears  your consciousness disappears. What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self  you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence  and  in fact  there can be images going on  being formed in the cerebral cortex  except you don't know they're there. You have  in effect  lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem. But if you consider the green part of the brain stem  nothing like that happens. It is that specific. So in that green component of the brain stem  if you damage it  and often it happens  what you get is complete paralysis  but your conscious mind is maintained. You feel  you know  you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly. This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it. And people are  in fact  imprisoned within their own bodies  but they do have a mind. There was a very interesting film  one of the rare good films done about a situation like this  by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition. So now I'm going to show you a picture. I promise not to say anything about this  except this is to frighten you. It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem  there are  to make it simple  all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior  different aspects of our body. They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern. And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe    and I could be wrong  but I don't think I am    that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings    primordial feelings  by the way. So what is the picture that we get here  Look at  cerebral cortex   look at  brain stem   look at  body   and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body. And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are  in fact  the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to  as we should  because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds. But look at the arrows. They're not there for looks. They're there because there's this very close interaction. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem. You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body. Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species. So throughout vertebrates  the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours  which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do. Except that they're not as rich as ours  because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do. That's where the difference is. And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex. Only the wealth of our minds is  not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence  and that we have any sense of person. Now there are three levels of self to consider    the proto  the core and the autobiographical. The first two are shared with many  many other species  and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species. It's the autobiographical self which some species have  I think. Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree. And everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree. But the novelty is here. The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made  it's the lived past and the anticipated future. And the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory  reasoning  imagination  creativity and language. And out of that came the instruments of culture    religions  justice  trade  the arts  science  technology. And it is within that culture that we really can get    and this is the novelty    something that is not entirely set by our biology. It is developed in the cultures. It developed in collectives of human beings. And this is  of course  the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio cultural regulation. And finally  you could rightly ask  why care about this  Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made  Three reasons. First  curiosity. Primates are extremely curious    and humans most of all. And if we are interested  for example  in the fact that anti gravity is pulling galaxies away from the Earth  why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings  Second  understanding society and culture. We should look at how society and culture in this socio cultural regulation are a work in progress. And finally  medicine. Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression  Alzheimer's disease  drug addiction. Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious. You have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non serendipitous way if you do not know how this works. So that's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing  and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains. Thank you for your attention. I study how the brain processes information. That is  how it takes information in from the outside world  and converts it into patterns of electrical activity  and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things    to see  hear  to reach for an object. So I'm really a basic scientist  not a clinician  but in the last year and a half I've started to switch over  to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices  and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this. It's really our first foray into this. It's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness. So let me start in on that problem. There are    million people in the U.S. and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina  diseases like macular degeneration  and there's little that can be done for them. There are some drug treatments  but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population. And so  for the vast majority of patients  their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices. The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well. They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide. And so  you know  for example  with these devices  patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges  not very much more  so nothing close to normal vision has been possible. So what I'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference  to be much more effective  and what I wanted to do is show you how it works. Okay  so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve. Here you have a retina. So you have an image  a retina  and a brain. So when you look at something  like this image of this baby's face  it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina  on the front end cells here  the photoreceptors. Then what happens is the retinal circuitry  the middle part  goes to work on it  and what it does is it performs operations on it  it extracts information from it  and it converts that information into a code. And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain  and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code. And when I say code  I do literally mean code. Like this pattern of pulses here actually means  baby's face   and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses  it knows that what was out there was a baby's face  and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was  say  a dog  or another pattern would be a house. Anyway  you get the idea. And  of course  in real life  it's all dynamic  meaning that it's changing all the time  so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too. So  you know  it's sort of a complicated thing. You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing. So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration  What happens is is that  the front end cells die  the photoreceptors die  and over time  all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them  they die too. Until the only things that you have left are these cells here  the output cells  the ones that send the signals to the brain  but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore. They aren't getting any input  so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information    that is  he or she is blind. So  a solution to the problem  then  would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells  and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain. So this is what we've been working on  and this is what our prosthetic does. So it consists of two parts  what we call an encoder and a transducer. And so the encoder does just what I was saying  it mimics the actions of the front end circuitry    so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code. And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain  and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output. So a completely blind retina  even one with no front end circuitry at all  no photoreceptors  can now send out normal signals  signals that the brain can understand. So no other device has been able to do this. Okay  so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing  because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool. I'm not sure  cool  is really the right word  but you know what I mean. So what it's doing is  it's replacing the retinal circuitry  really the guts of the retinal circuitry  with a set of equations  a set of equations that we can implement on a chip. So it's just math. In other words  we're not literally replacing the components of the retina. It's not like we're making a little mini device for each of the different cell types. We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations. And so  in a way  the equations are serving as sort of a codebook. An image comes in  goes through the set of equations  and out comes streams of electrical pulses  just like a normal retina would produce. Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output  and what the implications of this are. Here are three sets of firing patterns. The top one is from a normal animal  the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder transducer device  and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic. So the bottom one is the state of the art device that's out there right now  which is basically made up of light detectors  but no encoder. So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things    people  babies  park benches  you know  regular things happening    and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals. Now just to orient you  each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells  and just as in the previous slides  each row is a different cell  and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data. So as you can see  the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns    and it's not perfect  but it's pretty good    and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic  the responses really don't. And so with the standard method  the cells do fire  they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns because they don't have the right code. How important is this  What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see  So I'm just going to show you one bottom line experiment that answers this  and of course I've got a lot of other data  so if you're interested I'm happy to show more. So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment. So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked  what was the retina seeing at that moment  Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns  So  when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer. So let me show you  and I'm going to start with the standard method first. So you can see that it's pretty limited  and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code  they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there  but it's not so clear what that something is  and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning  that with the standard method  patients can see high contrast edges  they can see light  but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image  It was a baby's face. So what about with our approach  adding the code  And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face  but you can tell that it's this baby's face  which is a really challenging task. So on the left is the encoder alone  and on the right is from an actual blind retina  so the encoder and the transducer. But the key one really is the encoder alone  because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer. This is just actually the first one that we tried. I just wanted to say something about the standard method. When this first came out  it was just a really exciting thing  the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all. But there was this limiting factor  the issue of the code  and how to make the cells respond better  produce normal responses  and so this was our contribution. Now I just want to wrap up  and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested  but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language  and the potential power of being able to do that. So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device. Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood  and be understood by the brain. And then the last thing I wanted to say  really  is to emphasize that the idea generalizes. So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas  for example  the auditory system and the motor system  so for treating deafness and for motor disorders. So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells  we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve  or jump over damaged areas in the cortex  in the motor cortex  to bridge the gap produced by a stroke. I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really  really important  and if we can understand the code  the language of the brain  things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before. Thank you. Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school  There was this hero  Odysseus  who's heading back home after the Trojan War. And he's standing on the deck of his ship  he's talking to his first mate  and he's saying   Tomorrow  we will sail past those rocks  and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens. And these women sing an enchanting song  a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die.  Now you would expect  given that  that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens  but instead Odysseus says   I want to hear that song. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men    stay with me    so that you can't hear the song  and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected.  So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song. And I'd like to think if this was the case  they probably would have rehearsed it a few times. Odysseus would have said   Okay  let's do a dry run. You tie me to the mast  and I'm going to beg and plead. And no matter what I say  you cannot untie me from the mast. All right  so tie me to the mast.  And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot. And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says   Untie me. Untie me. I want to hear that song. Untie me.  And the first mate wisely resists and doesn't untie Odysseus. And then Odysseus says   I see that you can get it. All right  untie me now and we'll get some dinner.  And the first mate hesitates. He's like   Is this still the rehearsal  or should I untie him   And the first mate thinks   Well  I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end.  So he unties Odysseus  and Odysseus flips out. He's like   You idiot. You moron. If you do that tomorrow  I'll be dead  you'll be dead  every single one of the men will be dead. Now just don't untie me no matter what.  He throws the first mate to the ground. This repeats itself through the night    rehearsal  tying to the mast  conning his way out of it  beating the poor first mate up mercilessly. Hilarity ensues. Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device. A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head. Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it. Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation. There is first  the present self. This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song. He just wants to get to the front row. He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification. But then there's this other self  the future self. This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca    the other one. So why do we need commitment devices  Well resisting temptation is hard  as the   th century English economist Nassau William Senior said   To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power  or to seek distant rather than immediate results  are among the most painful exertions of the human will.  If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people  you probably realize it's not that your goals are physically impossible that's keeping you from achieving them  it's that you lack the self discipline to stick to them. It's physically possible to lose weight. It's physically possible to exercise more. But resisting temptation is hard. The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. I mean  let's face it  the present self is present. It's in control. It's in power right now. It has these strong  heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. And the future self is not even around. It's off in the future. It's weak. It doesn't even have a lawyer present. There's nobody to stick up for the future self. And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams. So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought  and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two. Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually. Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one  but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer. I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were. So when I was a starving post doc at Columbia University  I was deep in a publish or perish phase of my career. I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars. And when you try to execute these commitment devices  you realize the devil is really in the details. Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars. I mean  you can't burn it  that's illegal. And I thought  well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that. But then I thought  oh  I'm sending myself mixed messages. Because not writing is bad  but giving to charity is good. So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift. And then I kind of flipped that around and thought  well I could give it to the neo Nazis. But then I was like  that's more bad than writing is good  and so that wouldn't work. So ultimately  I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway. Sometimes a good person would find it  sometimes a bad person would find it. On average  it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret. Such it is with commitment devices. But despite my like for them  there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices  and you might feel this if you use them yourself. So the first is  when you've got one of these devices going  such as this contract to write everyday or pay  it's just a constant reminder that you have no self control. You're just telling yourself   Without you  commitment device  I am nothing  I have no self discipline.  And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place    like   Oh my God  that person's offering me a doughnut  and I have no defense mechanism      you just eat it. So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you. I think self discipline is something  it's like a muscle. The more you exercise it  the stronger it gets. The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them. You say   Well  of course I can't write today  because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews  and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that. And so there's no way that this is going to work.  So in effect  you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person. You're putting yourself  you're binding yourself  and you're weaseling your way out of it  and then you're beating yourself up afterwards. So I've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices. In particular  I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self. And this is a timely issue. I'm talking about the topic of saving. Now saving is a classic two selves problem. The present self does not want to save at all. It wants to consume. Whereas the future self wants the present self to save. So this is a timely problem. We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the     s. At the same time  the Retirement Risk Index  the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement  has been increasing. And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers  the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre retirement needs while they're in retirement. So what can we do about this  There's a philosopher  Derek Parfit  who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I. He said that   We might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination.  That is to say  we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old  or we might not be able to imagine that we're going to get old some day. On the one hand  it sounds ridiculous. Of course  we know that we're going to get old. But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time  So my coauthors and I have used computers  the greatest tool of our time  to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future. And I'll show you some of these tools right here. The first is called the distribution builder. It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future. Each outcome is shown by one of these markers  and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement. Being up at the top means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement. Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet. When you make an investment  what you're really saying is   I accept that any one of these     things could happen to me and determine my wealth.  Now you can try to move your outcomes around. You can try to manipulate your fate  like this person is doing  but it costs you something to do it. It means that you have to save more today. Once you find an investment that you're happy with  what people do is they click  done  and the markers begin to disappear  slowly  one by one. It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out. At the end  there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement. Yes  this person retired at     percent of their working income in retirement. They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working. If you're like most people  just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy    just to think about making    percent more money in retirement than before. However  had you ended up on the very bottom  it might have given you a slight sense of dread and or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement. By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome  people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well being in the future. Now people are motivated through emotions  but different people find different things motivating. This is a simulation that uses graphics  but other people find motivating what money can buy  not just numbers. So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes  I show people what those outcomes will get you  in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on                     dollars per month and so on. As you move down the ladder of apartments  you see that they get worse and worse. Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student. And as you get to the very bottom  you're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don't save anything for retirement  you won't be able to afford any housing at all. Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet. The last thing I'll show you  the last behavioral time machine  is something that I created with Hal Hershfield  who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project  Bill Sharpe. And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality. So what we do is we take pictures of people    in this case  college age people    and we use software to age them and show these people what they'll look like when they're            years old. And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior. So this is one of our experiments. Here we see the face of the young subject on the left. He's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate. As he moves his savings rate down  it means that he's saving zero when it's all the way here at the left. You can see his current annual income    this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today    is quite high     percent  but his retirement income is quite low. He's going to retire on    percent of what he earned while he was working. If he saves the maximum legal amount  his retirement income goes up  but he's unhappy because now he has less money on the left hand side to spend today. Other conditions show people the future self. And from the future self's point of view  everything is in reverse. If you save very little  the future self is unhappy living on    percent of the income. Whereas if the present self saves a lot  the future self is delighted  where the income is close up near     percent. To bring this to a wider audience  I've been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine  in which you not only get to see yourself in the future  but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth. So for instance  here is somebody using the tool. And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider. The younger face gets happier and happier  saving nothing. The older face is miserable. And slowly  slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate. And then it's a high savings rate. The younger face is getting unhappy. The older face is quite pleased with the decision. We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do. And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually  because as one face smiles  the other face frowns. It's not telling you which way to put the slider  it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self. Your decisions today are going to determine its well being. And that's something that's easy to forget. This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older. There are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke  if they get too much exposure to the sun  if they gain weight and so on. And what's good is  unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith  you don't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality. There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing. This is actually a picture of Hal  my coauthor. You might recognize him from the previous demos. And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding  aging and weight gain software to see how he would look. Hal is here  so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image. And I'll close it there. On behalf of Hal and myself  I wish all the best to your present and future selves. Thank you. In       I walked into a prison in Cambodia  and I met a    year old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel. And as I looked into his eyes  I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners  that I would never have written a letter for him  because he was not a    year old boy who had done something important for anybody. He was not a political prisoner. He was a    year old boy who had stolen a bicycle. What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia  but of the     developing countries that torture     of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured. And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool. We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst  but  in fact     percent of torture today is not for political prisoners. It is for people who are in broken down legal systems  and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation    it's cheaper than having a legal system  cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel    it is what happens most of the time. I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community  if we make a decision  to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime  but it will require three things. First is the training  empowerment  and connection of defenders worldwide. The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel. And the third is commitment. So in the year       I began to wonder  what if we came together  Could we do something for these    countries  And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the    countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms. My first experiences  though  did come from Cambodia  and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were  in       still less than    attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all. And even    years later  there was only    lawyers in the country  so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet    year old boys  you'd meet women and you'd say   Why are you here   Women would say   Well I've been here for    years because my husband committed a crime  but they can't find him.  So it's just a place where there was no rule of law. The first group of defenders came together and I still remember  as I was training  I said   Okay  what do you do for an investigation   And there was silence in the class  and finally one woman stood up   inaudible name   and she said  Khrew   which means  teacher.  She said   I have defended more than a hundred people  and I've never had to do any investigation  because they all come with confessions.  And we talked about  as a class  the fact that number one  the confessions might not be reliable  but number two  we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this  especially as it was now against the law. And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws. And I still remember the first cases where they came  all    together  she would stand up  and they were in the back  and they would support her  and the judges kept saying   No  no  no  no  we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them.  But one day the perfect case came  and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller  she was sitting outside of a house. She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was  but the police came  they got her  there was nothing on her. She was pregnant at the time. She had cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried. And when they brought her case to the judge  for the first time he stood up and he said   Yes  there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released.  And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see  they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia. But Cambodia is not alone. I used to think  well is it Cambodia  Or is it other countries  But it is in so many countries. In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't a    year old boy  it was an   year old boy for stealing a mobile phone. Or a woman  I picked up her baby  really cute baby  I said  Your baby is so cute.  It wasn't a baby  she was three. And she said  Yeah  but she's why I'm here   because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison. And when I walked up to the prison director  I said   You've got to let her out. A judge would let her out.  And he said   Okay  we can talk about it  but look at my prison. Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer. What can we do   So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases. But we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers  but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference. For example  in Cambodia  it was that  inaudible name  did not go alone but she had    lawyers with her who stood up together. And in the same way  in China  they always tell me   It's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together.  Or in Zimbabwe  where I remember Innocent  after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said   I've been here for one year  eight years     years without a lawyer   he came and we had a training together and he said   I have heard it said     because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling     I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources.  And then he said   But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice.  And with that  he successfully organized    lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases. The key that we see  though  is training and then early access. I was recently in Egypt  and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers  and what they told me is that they said   Hey  look  we don't have police on the streets now. The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution. They were torturing everybody all the time.  And I said   But there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here. What's going on   I met with one of the development agencies  and they were training prosecutors and judges  which is the normal bias  as opposed to defenders. And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual. I said   I'm gonna copy this.  It had everything in it. Lawyers can come at the police station. It was perfect. Prosecutors were perfectly trained. But I said to them   I just have one question  which is  by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office  what had happened to them   And after a pause  they said   They had been tortured.  So the pieces are  not only the training of the lawyers  but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel  because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured. And as I tell you this  I'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like   Oh  okay  it sounds like we could do it  but can we really do it   Because it sounds big. And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible. The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment. It's not only Innocent  who I told you about in Zimbabwe  but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces. We have a program called JusticeMakers  and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things  but how can we support them  So it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice. And there are    JusticeMakers throughout the world  from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC  who with five thousand dollars do amazing things  through SMS programs  through paralegal programs  through whatever they can do. And it's not only these JusticeMakers  but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward. So in China  for instance  great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished. And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers  and said   How can we get this out  How can we make sure that this is implemented  This is fantastic.  And he said to me   Well  do you have money   And I said   No.  And he said   That's okay  we can still figure it out.  And on December    he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League  from    of the top law schools  who organized themselves  developed posters with the new laws  and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights. So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders. We need to systematically implement early access to counsel. But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this. And people often say to me   You know  this is great  but it's wildly idealistic. Never going to happen.  And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery  or end apartheid. It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit. Now  there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders  which they share from each other  is   Take courage friends  the road is often long  the path is never clear  and the stakes are very high  but deep down  you are not alone.  And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders  but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it  we can end torture as an investigative tool. I end always  because I'm sure the questions are    and I'd be happy to talk to you at any point     But what can I really do   Well  I would say this. First of all  you know what you can do. But second of all  I would leave you with the story of Vishna  who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice. Vishna was a   year old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province. But because he was born in the prison  everybody loved him  including the guards  so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars. So  you know  there's bars. And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger  which means what gets bigger  Your head gets bigger. So he would come to the first bar  the second bar and then the third bar  and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through  and come back  third  second  first. And he would grab my pinkie  because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit. You know  he never quite made it to all of them every day  but he wanted to visit all     prisoners. And I would lift him  and he would put his fingers through. Or if they were dark cells  it was like iron corrugated  and he would put his fingers through. And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine  and they looked forward to him. And I was like  here's Vishna. He's a   year old boy. He was born in a prison with almost nothing  no material goods  but he had a sense of his own heroic journey  which I believe we are all born into. He said   Probably I can't do everything. But I'm one. I can do something. And I will do the one thing that I can do.  So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together  and invite you into this journey with us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I've been in Afghanistan for    years. I work for the Red Cross and I'm a physical therapist. My job is to make arms and legs    well it's not completely true. We do more than that. We provide the patients  the Afghan disabled  first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration. It's a very logical plan  but it was not always like this. For many years  we were just providing them with artificial limbs. It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now. Today  I would like to tell you a story  the story of a big change  and the story of the people who made this change possible. I arrived in Afghanistan in      to work in a hospital for war victims. And then  not only for war victims  but it was for any kind of patient. I was also working in the orthopedic center  we call it. This is the place where we make the legs. At that time I found myself in a strange situation. I felt not quite ready for that job. There was so much to learn. There were so many things new to me. But it was a terrific job. But as soon as the fighting intensified  the physical rehabilitation was suspended. There were many other things to do. So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority. It was a strange sensation. Anyway  you know every time I make this speech    it's not the first time    but it's an emotion. It's something that comes out from the past. It's    years  but they are still all there. Anyway  in       the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan. And the orthopedic center was closed. I was assigned to work for the homeless  for the internally displaced people. But one day  something happened. I was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions. I wanted to go home. I was driving. You know  when you want to forget  you don't want to see things  so you just want to go to your room  to lock yourself inside and say   That's enough.  A bomb fell not far from my car    well  far enough  but big noise. And everybody disappeared from the street. The cars disappeared as well. I ducked. And only one figure remained in the middle of the road. It was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to move away. Well I'm not a particularly brave person  I have to confess it  but I could not just ignore him. So I stopped the car and I went to help. The man was without legs and only with one arm. Behind him there was a child  his son  red in the face in an effort to push the father. So I took him into a safe place. And I ask   What are you doing out in the street in this situation    I work   he said. I wondered  what work  And then I ask an even more stupid question   Why don't you have the prostheses  Why don't you have the artificial legs   And he said   The Red Cross has closed.  Well without thinking  I told him  Come tomorrow. We will provide you with a pair of legs.  The man  his name was Mahmoud  and the child  whose name was Rafi  left. And then I said   Oh  my God. What did I say  The center is closed  no staff around. Maybe the machinery is broken. Who is going to make the legs for him   So I hoped that he would not come. This is the streets of Kabul in those days. So I said   Well I will give him some money.  And so the following day  I went to the orthopedic center. And I spoke with a gatekeeper. I was ready to tell him   Listen  if someone such and such comes tomorrow  please tell him that it was a mistake. Nothing can be done. Give him some money.  But Mahmoud and his son were already there. And they were not alone. There were     maybe     people like him waiting. And there was some staff too. Among them there was my right hand man  Najmuddin. And the gatekeeper told me   They come everyday to see if the center will open.  I said   No. We have to go away. We cannot stay here.  They were bombing    not very close    but you could hear the noise of the bombs. So   We cannot stay here  it's dangerous. It's not a priority.  But Najmuddin told me   Listen now  we're here.  At least we can start repairing the prostheses  the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like Mahmoud.  I said   No  please. We cannot do that. It's really dangerous. We have other things to do.  But they insisted. When you have    people in front of you  looking at you and you are the one who has to decide ... So we started doing some repairs. Also one of the physical therapists reported that Mahmoud could be provided with a leg  but not immediately. The legs were swollen and the knees were stiff  so he needed a long preparation. Believe me  I was worried because I was breaking the rules. I was doing something that I was not supposed to do. In the evening  I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters  and I told them    I lied    I told them   Listen  we are going to start a couple of hours per day  just a few repairs.  Maybe some of them are here now. So we started. I was working  I was going everyday to work for the homeless. And Najmuddin was staying there  doing everything and reporting on the patients. He was telling me   Patients are coming.  We knew that many more patients could not come  prevented by the fighting. But people were coming. And Mahmoud was coming every day. And slowly  slowly week after week his legs were improving. The stump or cast prosthesis was made  and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation. He was coming every day  crossing the front line. A couple of times I crossed the front line in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing. I tell you  it was something so sinister that I was astonished he could do it every day. But finally  the great day arrived. Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs. It was April  I remember  a very beautiful day. April in Kabul is beautiful  full of roses  full of flowers. We could not possibly stay indoors  with all these sandbags at the windows. Very sad  dark. So we chose a small spot in the garden. And Mahmoud put on his prostheses  the other patients did the same  and they started practicing for the last time before being discharged. Suddenly  they started fighting. Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting. We could hear in the air the bullets passing. So we dashed  all of us  towards the shelter. Mahmoud grabbed his son  I grabbed someone else. Everybody was grabbing something. And we ran. You know     meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed  but we managed to reach the shelter. Inside  all of us panting  I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father   Father  you can run faster than me.  And Mahmoud   Of course I can. I can run  and now you can go to school. No need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair.  Later on  we took them home. And I will never forget Mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair. And then I understood  physical rehabilitation is a priority. Dignity cannot wait for better times. From that day on  we never closed a single day. Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours  but we never  we never closed it again. I met Mahmoud one year later. He was in good shape    a bit thinner. He needed to change his prostheses    a new pair of prostheses. I asked about his son. He told me   He's at school. He'd doing quite well.  But I understood he wanted to tell me something. So I asked him   What is that   He was sweating. He was clearly embarrassed. And he was standing in front of me  his head down. He said   You have taught me to walk. Thank you very much. Now help me not to be a beggar anymore.  That was the job.  My children are growing. I feel ashamed. I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students.  I said   Okay.  I thought  how much money do I have in my pocket  Just to give him some money. It was the easiest way. He read my mind  and he said   I ask for a job.  And then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life. He said   I am a scrap of a man  but if you help me  I'm ready to do anything  even if I have to crawl on the ground.  And then he sat down. I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere. Legless  with only one arm  illiterate  unskilled    what job for him  Najmuddin told me   Well we have a vacancy in the carpentry shop.   What   I said   Stop.   Well yes  we need to increase the production of feet. We need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet. We need to increase the production.   Excuse me   I could not believe. And then he said   No  we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool  a special anvil  special vice  and maybe an electric screwdriver.  I said   Listen  it's insane. And it's even cruel to think of anything like this. That's a production line and a very fast one. It's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he's going to fail.  But with Najmuddin  we cannot discuss. So the only things I could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise. Only one week    one week try and not a single day more. One week later  Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line. I told Najmuddin   That's a trick. I can't believe it.  The production was up    percent.  It's a trick  it's a trick   I said. And then I asked for verification. It was true. The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove. I understood that I was wrong again. Mahmoud had looked taller. I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling. He was a new man  taller again. Of course  I understood that what made him stand tall    yeah they were the legs  thank you very much    but as a first step  it was the dignity. He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job. So of course  I understood. And then we started a new policy    a new policy completely different. We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job. It became a policy of  positive discrimination   we call it now. And you know what  It's good for everybody. Everybody benefits from that    those employed  of course  because they get a job and dignity. But also for the newcomers. They are       every year    people coming for the first time. And you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them. Sometimes you see them  they look   Oh.  And you see the faces. And then the surprise turns into hope. And it's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability. Poof  they learn much faster    the motivation  the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different  completely. Scraps of men do not exist. People like Mahmoud are agents of change. And when you start changing  you cannot stop. So employing people  yes  but also we started programming projects of microfinance  education. And when you start  you cannot stop. So you do vocational training  home education for those who cannot go to school. Physical therapies can be done  not only in the orthopedic center  but also in the houses of the people. There is always a better way to do things. That's Najmuddin  the one with the white coat. Terrible Najmuddin  is that one. I have learned a lot from people like Najmuddin  Mahmoud  Rafi. They are my teachers. I have a wish  a big wish  that this way of working  this way of thinking  is going to be implemented in other countries. There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan. It is possible and it is not difficult. All we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist  to make them part of the decision making process and then  of course  to adapt. This is my big wish. Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over  not at all. We are going on. Recently we have just started a program  a sport program    basketball for wheelchair users. We transport the wheelchairs everywhere. We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan. At the beginning  when Anajulina told me   We would like to start it   I hesitated. I said   No   you can imagine. I said   No  no  no  no  we can't.  And then I asked the usual question   Is it a priority  Is it really necessary   Well now you should see me. I never miss a single training session. The night before a match I'm very nervous. And you should see me during the match. I shout like a true Italian. What's next  What is going to be the next change  Well I don't know yet  but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends  they have it already in mind. That was my story. Thank you very much.
