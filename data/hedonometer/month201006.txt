We're        years after the advent of the Macintosh  which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human machine interface and in computation in general. It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation  thought about computers  how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them. It was such a radical change  in fact  that the early Macintosh development team in '    '    '   had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up. Now  this is an interesting little message  and it's a lesson that has since  I think  been forgotten or lost or something  and that is  namely  that the OS is the interface. The interface is the OS. It's like the land and the king  i.e. Arthur  they're inseparable  they are one. And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter. It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines. There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers. So it was a necessity. But in the quarter century since then  we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk. So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between        and a million. Same thing for processor speeds. Networks  we didn't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction  and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers. And  of course  graphics  Today    dollars and    cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago. So we've got that incredible ramp up. Then  on the side  we've got the Web and  increasingly  the cloud  which is fantastic  but also    in the regard in which an interface is fundamental    kind of a distraction. So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces. Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard  and people are starting to wake up about that. So what happens next  Where do we go from there  The problem  as we see it  has to do with a single  simple word   space   or a single  simple phrase   real world geometry.  Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in  that we teach them in  are hideously insensate when it comes to space. They don't understand real world space. It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well. They also don't understand time  but that's a matter for a separate talk. So what happens if you start to explain space to them  One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room. The Luminous Room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co located. That's a strangely simple  and yet unexplored idea  right  When you use a mouse  your hand is down here on the mouse pad. It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about  The pixels are up on the display. So here was a room in which all the walls  floors  ceilings  pets  potted plants  whatever was in there  were capable  not only of display but of sensing as well. And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this. That's a digital storage in a physical container. The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers. Has to come back out  whatever you put in. This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well. If you presented it with a chess board  it tried to figure out what you might mean by that. And if there was nothing for them to do  the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away. The academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous  so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser. The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects  and the system projects down the laser beam path. So you've got an interface that has no interface. You operate the world as you operate the real world  which is to say  with your hands. Similarly  a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left    not that remarkable in a sense  we didn't invent the mathematics. But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display  it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object  a real world object in that. Here  the real world merges with the simulation. And finally  to pull out all the stops  this is a system called Urp  for urban planners  in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems. And we make the machine meet them half way. It projects down digital shadows  as you see here. And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock  then you can control the sun's position in the sky. That's   a.m. shadows. They get a little shorter at   a.m. There you are  swinging the sun around. Short shadows at noon and so forth. And we built up a series of tools like this. There are inter shadowing studies that children can operate  even though they don't know anything about urban planning  To move a building  you simply reach out your hand and you move the building. A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions. Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways  A zoning tool connects distant structures  a building and a roadway. Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission  And so forth. Now  if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated  that's great  they should seem familiar. This work is    years old. This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii  director of the Tangible Media Group. But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell  one of the world's legendary production designers. But Alex was preparing a little  sort of obscure  indie  arthouse film called  Minority Report  for Steven Spielberg  and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film. And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude  the idea that the putative      that we were painting in the film be believable  that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R D effort. And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual. People still reference those sequences in  Minority Report  when they talk about new UI design. So this led full circle  in a strange way  to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface  the Spatial Operating Environment  we call it. So here we have a bunch of stuff  some images. And  using a hand  we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom  six degrees of navigational control. And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye. And you can come back out through the scary orangutan. And that's all well and good. Let's do something a little more difficult. Here  we have a whole bunch of disparate images. We can fly around them. So navigation is a fundamental issue. You have to be able to navigate in  D. Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial. And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it. Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways. So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it. We can organize it this way. And  of course  it's not just about navigation  but about manipulation as well. So if we don't like stuff  or we're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications  we can pull them out like that. And then if it's time for analysis  we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution. Let's just come down a bit and fly around. So that's a different way to look at stuff. If you're of a more analytical nature then you might want  actually  to look at this as a color histogram. So now we've got the stuff color sorted  angle maps onto color. And now  if we want to select stuff   D  space  the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in  not in  D  not in fake  D  but in actual  D. Here are some selection planes. And we'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. So  from there to the world of real work. Here's a logistics system  a small piece of one that we're currently building. There're a lot of elements. And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three dimensional and geospatial information. So here's a familiar place. And we'll bring this back here for a second. Maybe select a little bit of that. And bring out this graph. And we should  now  be able to fly in here and have a closer look. These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States. One thing that three dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers. That's the old way  that's the old mantra  one machine  one human  one mouse  one screen. Well  that doesn't really cut it anymore. In the real world  we have people who collaborate  we have people who have to work together  and we have many different displays. And we might want to look at these various images. We might want to ask for some help. The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there  so I can pull this from there to there. These are unrelated machines  right  So the computation is space soluble and network soluble. So I'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul. Paul is the designer of this wand  and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on. So let me get some of these out of the way. Let's pull this apart  I'll go ahead and explode it. Kevin  can you help  Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board. Mind you  it's a sort of gratuitous field stripping exercise  but we do it in the lab all the time. All right. So collaborative work  whether it's immediately co located or distant and distinct  is always important. And again  that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space. And finally  I'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery. This is a system called TAMPER  which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be. We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine grained form. So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here. And let's just pick out a few elements. We can zip through them as a possibility. We can grab elements off the front  where upon they reanimate  come to life  and drag them down onto the table here. We'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well. We may need more than one. And we probably need  well  we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest. Yeah  let's take that one. You see  cowboys and French farce people don't go well together  and the system knows that. Let me leave with one final thought  and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift. And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs   .    dollars   or whether you have to spring    million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer  he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence. And I think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology. Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity  and we need to demand that  in fact. For some of this kind of technology  ground center is a combination of design  which is crucially important. We can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start. And  as well  as of efficacy  agency. We're  as human beings  the creatures that create  and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image. So I will leave you with that. Thank you. Chris Anderson  So to ask the obvious question    actually this is from Bill Gates    when   John Underkoffler  When   CA  When real  When for us  not just in a lab and on a stage  Can it be for every man  or is this just for corporations and movie producers  JU  No  it has to be for every human being. That's our goal entirely. We won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step. I mean it's been    years. Can there really be only one interface  There can't. CA  But does that mean that  at your desk or in your home  you need projectors  cameras  You know  how can it work  JU  No  this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display. It'll be built into architecture. The gloves go away in a matter of months or years. So this is the inevitability about it. CA  So  in your mind  five years time  someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface  JU  I think in five years time when you buy a computer  you'll get this. CA  Well that's cool. The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used. What do you think  what in your mind is the first killer app for this  JU  That's a good question  and we ask ourselves that every day. At the moment  our early adopter customers    and these systems are deployed out in the real world    do all the big data intensive  data heavy problems with it. So  whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction  financial services  pharmaceuticals  bioinformatics  those are the topics right now  but that's not a killer app. And I understand what you're asking. CA  C'mon  c'mon. Martial arts  games. C'mon. John  thank you for making science fiction real. JU  It's been a great pleasure. Thank you to you all. I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine. I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child. And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater  incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors. And after even    years of doing this  after    years of exploring the ocean  I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea. But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well  things that I don't think most people realize. And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story. I want people to see what's happening underwater  both the horror and the magic. The first story that I did for National Geographic  where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage  was a story I proposed on harp seals. The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship  mating and to have their pups. And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide. And because I'm an underwater photographer  I wanted to do this story from both above and below  to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy    degree water. But as I got more involved in the story  I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore. The first was that these animals continue to be hunted  killed with hakapiks at about eight     days old. It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet  with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year. But as disturbing as that is  I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming. This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season. And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture  there's a lot of water as well  which wasn't there historically. And the ice that is there is quite thin. The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms. They only need    days from the moment they're born until they're on their own. But if they don't get    days  they can fall into the ocean and die. This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old    still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly    that has fallen in because of the thin ice  and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase. This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there. I read that last year the pup mortality rate was     percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. So  clearly  this species has a lot of problems going forward. This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic. And it received quite a bit of attention. And with that  I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems. So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis  in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last    years  but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that    percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last    or    years. These are the tuna  the billfish and the sharks. When I read that  I was blown away by those numbers. I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet  but it really wasn't  so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story. I wanted it to be more like war photography  where I was making harder hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet. The first component of the story that I thought was essential  however  was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating. You know  I think people go into a restaurant  and somebody orders a steak  and we all know where steak comes from  and somebody orders a chicken  and we know what a chicken is  but when they're eating bluefin sushi  do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming  These are the lions and tigers of the sea. In reality  these animals have no terrestrial counterpart  they're unique in the world. These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year. If we weren't so efficient at catching them  because they grow their entire life  would have    year old bluefin out there that weigh a ton. But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them  and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago. And every single day these tuna  bluefin like this  are stacked up like cordwood  just warehouse after warehouse. As I wandered around and made these pictures  it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store  you know. We can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result. I also  with the story  wanted to show readers how fish are caught  some of the methods that are used to catch fish  like a bottom trawler  which is one of the most common methods in the world. This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp  but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world. You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end. And as this assembly is towed through the water  the doors meet resistance with the ocean  and it opens the mouth of the net  and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom. And this just drags over the bottom  in this case to catch shrimp. But as you can imagine  it's catching everything else in its path as well. And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom  things like sponges and corals  that critical habitat for other animals. This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour. So he had a handful of shrimp  maybe seven or eight shrimp  and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch. These are animals that died in the process  but have no commercial value. So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner  maybe seven or eight shrimp and    pounds of other animals that had to die in the process. And to make that point even more visual  I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death  you know  animals like guitarfish  bat rays  flounder  pufferfish  that only an hour before  were on the bottom of the ocean  alive  but now being thrown back as trash. I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because  currently on planet Earth  we're killing over     million sharks every single year. But before I went out to photograph this component  I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know  I think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark. But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net. And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible  it struck me as sort of a crucifixion  if you will. This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic. And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of     million sharks. And because I love sharks    I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks    I wanted to do another  more celebratory  story about sharks  as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation. So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days  but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy  largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago. And I wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations. One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach  in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water. This is a low altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind. But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters. I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary. And with this photograph of a beautiful    feet  probably    feet  I guess  female tiger shark  I sort of think I got to that goal  where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose  and my strobe created a shadow on her face. And I think it's a gentler picture  a little less threatening  a little more respectful of the species. I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead  an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or    years ago. It's a very solitary creature. But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas. You know  we know almost nothing about them. We don't know where they migrate to or from  where they mate  where they have their pups  and yet  hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about    percent in the last    to    years. You know  we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. This is the oceanic whitetip shark  an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species  if you pay attention to such lists. But it's an animal that's about    percent in decline throughout most of its range. Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water  and because we weren't working on the bottom  I brought along a shark cage here  and my friend  shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage. You'll see that the photographer  of course  was not inside the cage here  so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. And lastly with this story  I also wanted to focus on baby sharks  shark nurseries. And I went to the island of Bimini  in the Bahamas  to work with lemon shark pups. This is a photo of a lemon shark pup  and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves. This is a very sort of un shark like photograph. It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture. But  you know  here we see a shark that's maybe    or    inches long swimming in about a foot of water. But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two  three years of their lives  until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef. After I left Bimini  I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort. And other recent stories have looked at single  flagship species  if you will  that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats. One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle. This is the largest  widest ranging  deepest diving and oldest of all turtle species. Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad. These are animals whose lineage dates back about     million years. And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by. And today  they crawl out and see condominiums. But despite this amazing longevity  they're now considered critically endangered. In the Pacific  where I made this photograph  their stocks have declined about    percent in the last    years. This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey. Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity. But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore. Nature has learned to compensate with that  and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds. But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses  human things  like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net. I actually jumped in and photographed this  and with the fisherman's permission  I cut the turtle out  and it was able to swim free. But  you know  thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate  and the species' future is in great danger. Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale. And essentially  the story is this with right whales  that about a million years ago  there was one species of right whale on the planet  but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated  the species sort of separated  and today we have essentially two distinct stocks. We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida. Now  both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers  but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity. The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales  they live along the east coast of North America  United States and Canada  and they have to deal with all these urban ills. This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida. You can see the coal burning plant in the background. They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean  and maybe even affecting their reproduction. They also get entangled in fishing gear. This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale. And those white markings are not natural markings. These are entanglement scars.    percent of the population has such scars  but most don't shed the gear  things like lobster traps and crab pots. They hold on to them  and it eventually kills them. And the other problem is they get hit by ships. And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia  Canada being towed in  where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death  which was indeed a ship strike. So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low. And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population  I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about    years ago in the sub Antarctic of New Zealand  a place called the Auckland Islands. I went down there in the winter time. And these are animals that had never seen humans before  and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen. And I got in the water with them  and I was amazed at how curious they were. This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about    feet and one of these amazingly beautiful     foot     ton whales  like a city bus just swimming up  you know. They were in perfect condition  very fat and healthy  robust  no entanglement scars  the way they're supposed to look. You know  I read that the pilgrims  when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in       wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales. And we can't go back and see that today  but maybe we can preserve what we have left. And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope  a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing  the global fish crisis story. I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive  and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean. And I really wanted this story to be about three things  I wanted it to be about abundance  about diversity and about resilience. And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand. What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in       they hoped and expected that certain things might happen. For example  they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction. And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen. For example  these fish predate on sea urchins  and when the fish were all gone  all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins. But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population  low and behold  kelp forests emerged in shallow water. And that's because the urchins eat kelp. So when the fish control the urchin population  the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium. You know  this is probably how the ocean looked here one or     years ago  but nobody was around to tell us. I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well  in beautiful  fragile  protected areas like in Fiordland  where this sea pen colony was found. Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color. In the northern part of New Zealand  I dove in the blue water  where the water's a little warmer  and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon. Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy  from tiny  little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold. And I wanted to finish with this photograph  a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me. And I was in a place that had only been protected about    years ago. And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years  and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the     s. And that's because it's been protected  that it has come back. So I think the message is clear. The ocean is  indeed  resilient and tolerant to a point  but we must be good custodians. I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea  and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it  and I don't think it's too late. Thank you very much. Tom Green  That's a  chan thing. These kids on the Internet  they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  barrel roll.  It's a video game move from  Star Fox.   Star Fox       Assistant   Star Fox   .   Tom Green  Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year. I got to tell you  it's driving me nuts  actually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream    chan   Christopher Poole  When I was     I found this website called Futaba Channel. And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. That format of forum  at that time  was not well known outside of Japan. And so what I did is I took it  I translated it into English  and I stuck it up for my friends to use. Now  six and a half years later  over seven million people are using it  contributing over         posts per day. And we've gone from one board to    boards. This is what it looks like. So  what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous  and it has no memory. There's no archive  there are no barriers  there's no registration. These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on  chan. And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw  completely unfiltered. What the site's known for  because it has this environment  is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena  viral videos and whatnot  known as  memes.  Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats    just silly pictures of cats with text. And this resonates with millions of people  apparently  because there are tens of thousands of these  and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple  classic bait and switch. Somebody says they're linking to something interesting  and you get an '  s pop song. That's all it was. And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade  and Rick Astley pops out  and rickrolls millions of people on television. There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream  the ones I've just shown you  but every day  every month  people are producing thousands of these. So does a site like this have rules  We do  they're the codified rules that I've come up with  which are more or less ignored by the community. And so they've come up with their own set of rules  the  Rules of the Internet.  And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. Rule one is you don't talk about  b . Two is you do not talk about  b . And this one's kind of interesting   If it exists  there is porn of it. No exceptions.  And I will spare you that slide. I assure you  it is very true.  b  is the first board we started with  and it is  in many ways  the beating heart of the website. It is where a third of all the traffic is going. And  b  is known for  more than anything  not just the memes they've created  but the exploits. And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago  and that was the Time     poll. So somebody at Time  at the magazine  thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. And so they placed me on it  and the Internet got wind of it. My community decided they wanted me to win it. I didn't instruct them to do it  they just decided that that's what they wanted. And so  you know      percent approval rating ain't so bad. So they broke that poll. And I ended up on top. I ended up at this really fancy party. But that's not what's interesting about this. It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list  they were actually    it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top    places to spell  mARBLECAKE. ALSO  THE GAME.  The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible. And  marble cake  is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized. Anonymous is this group of people that protested  very famously  Scientology. The story is  Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online. They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet. And so these people  over       people  less than one month later  organized in a hundred cities around the globe and    this is L.A.    protested the Church of Scientology  and they have continued to do so  now  two full years after the fact. They are still protesting. So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. And last  I'm going to show you the example  the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And  you know  this didn't sit well with people  and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they    I mean  they put CSI to shame here    the Internet detectives came out. They matched  they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within    hours  they had his name  and within    hours  he was arrested. And so  what I think is really intriguing about a community like  chan is just that it's this open place. As I said  it's raw  it's unfiltered. And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards  you know  a lack of privacy  really. We're sacrificing a lot of that  and I think in doing so  moving towards those things  we're losing something valuable. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Got a couple questions for you. But if I ask them  is the TED website going to go down  CP  You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. CA  Well  you never know. Some of them    we've got people in    countries out there watching. Don't tell. But seriously  this issue on anonymity is    I mean  you made the case there. But anonymity basically allows people to say anything  all the rules gone. You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. CP  Yes and no. I mean  for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment  there is plenty of bad. There are plenty of downsides. But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people    there are very few places  now  where you can go and not have identity  to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. And saying whatever you like  I think  is powerful. Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. But I think it's important to have these places. When I get emails  people say   Thank you for giving me this place  this outlet  where I can come after work and be myself.  CA  But words  saying things  you know  can be constructive  it can be really damaging. And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  I mean  surely there are huge risks with that. CP  There are  certainly. But    CA  Tell me about what    I mean  I think you asked the board what you might say at TED  right  CP  Yeah  I posted a thread on Sunday. And within    hours  it had over        responses. And the thing is  I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said  more or less.    percent of it is just  would have been  you know  bleeped out. But there were some good things that came out of that too. Love and peace were mentioned. CA  Love and peace were mentioned  kind of with quote marks around them  right  CP  Cats and dogs were mentioned too. CA  And that content is all off the board now. Right  it's gone  Or is it still up there  CP  I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days. It went up to about        posts  and now it has been taken off. CA  Okay  well. Now  I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. Chris  you yourself  I mean  you're a figure of some intrigue. You've got this surprising semi underground influence  but it's not making you a lot of money  yet. What's the commercial picture here  CP  The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one  I guess. The site has adult content on it. I mean  obviously  it's got some very offensive  obscene content on it  just in terms of language alone. And when you've got that  you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. CA  But you still live at home  right  CP  I actually moved out recently. CA  That's very cool. CP  I got out of Mom's  and I'm back in school right now. CA  But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about  chan  CP  At first  very kind of pained  awkward conversations. The content is not dinner table conversation in the least. But my parents    I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. CA  And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. CP  Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. CA  And so  in    years' time  what do you picture yourself doing  CP  That's a good question. As I said  I just went back to school  and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning  kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. CA  Chris  thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED. We live in difficult and challenging economic times  of course. And one of the first victims of difficult economic times  I think  is public spending of any kind  but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science  and particularly curiosity led science and exploration. So I want to try and convince you in about    minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do. But I think to set the scene  I want to show    the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED  but it is a bit of a mess. But actually  it's not my fault  it's from the Guardian newspaper. And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs. Because  if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science and exploration  I should tell you how much it costs. So this is a game called  spot the science budgets.  This is the U.K. government spend. You see there  it's about     billion a year. The science budget is actually    if you look to your left  there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs. And it's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob. It's about  .  billion pounds per year out of     billion. That funds everything in the U.K. from medical research  space exploration  where I work  at CERN in Geneva  particle physics  engineering  even arts and humanities  funded from the science budget  which is that  .  billion  that little  tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen. So that's what we're arguing about. That percentage  by the way  is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France. R D in total in the economy  publicly funded  is about  .  percent of GDP. So that's what we're arguing about. The first thing I want to say  and this is straight from  Wonders of the Solar System   is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful. This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn  after we'd finished filming  Wonders of the Solar System.  So it isn't in the series. It's of the moon Enceladus. So that big sweeping  white sphere in the corner is Saturn  which is actually in the background of the picture. And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus  which is about as big as the British Isles. It's about     kilometers in diameter. So  tiny moon. What's fascinating and beautiful ... this an unprocessed picture  by the way  I should say  it's black and white  straight from Saturnian orbit. What's beautiful is  you can probably see on the limb there some faint  sort of  wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb. This is how we visualize that in  Wonders of the Solar System.  It's a beautiful graphic. What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon. That's fascinating and beautiful in itself  but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon. And what's important about that is that  on our planet  on Earth  wherever we find liquid water  we find life. So  to find strong evidence of liquid  pools of liquid  beneath the surface of a moon     million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding. So what we're saying  essentially  is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system. Well  let me just say  that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture. That's one more picture of Enceladus. This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus. So it made a very low pass  just a few hundred kilometers above the surface. And so this  again  a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space  absolutely beautiful. But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system. That's probably this place  which is a moon of Jupiter  Europa. And again  we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon  as most moons  was anything other than a dead ball of rock. It's actually an ice moon. So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa  which is a thick sheet of ice  probably a hundred kilometers thick. But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter  and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around  we've inferred very strongly that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa. So below the ice  there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon. It could be hundreds of kilometers deep  we think. We think it's saltwater  and that would mean that there's more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined. So that place  a little moon around Jupiter  is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth  that we know of. Tremendous and beautiful discovery. Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful. It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask  which is   Are we alone in the universe   Is there any other use to exploration and science  other than just a sense of wonder  Well  there is. This is a very famous picture taken  actually  on my first Christmas Eve  December   th        when I was about eight months old. It was taken by Apollo   as it went around the back of the moon. Earthrise from Apollo  . A famous picture  many people have said that it's the picture that saved       which was a turbulent year    the student riots in Paris  the height of the Vietnam War. The reason many people think that about this picture  and Al Gore has said it many times  actually  on the stage at TED  is that this picture  arguably  was the beginning of the environmental movement. Because  for the first time  we saw our world  not as a solid  immovable  kind of indestructible place  but as a very small  fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space. What's also not often said about the space exploration  about the Apollo program  is the economic contribution it made. I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this  it cost a lot  didn't it  Well  actually  many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness  the economic impact of Apollo. The biggest one was in      by Chase Econometrics. And it showed that for every    spent on Apollo     came back into the U.S. economy. So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration  in engineering  achievement and  I think  in inspiring young scientists and engineers    times over. So exploration can pay for itself. What about scientific discovery  What about driving innovation  Well  this looks like a picture of virtually nothing. What it is  is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen. See  back in the     s      s  many scientists  many observers  looked at the light given off from atoms. And they saw strange pictures like this. What you're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow like a white light  it just emits light at particular colors  a red one  a light blue one  some dark blue ones. Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them. And the electrons can only be in particular places. And when they jump up to the next place they can be  and fall back down again  they emit light at particular colors. And so the fact that atoms  when you heat them up  only emit light at very specific colors  was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory  the theory of the structure of atoms. I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable. This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun. And now  this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing light. And again  they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down  jump up and fall down. But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum. And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element. And that's why helium's called helium. It's called  helios     helios from the Sun. Now  that sounds esoteric  and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit  but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon  for example. The way that silicon behaves  the fact that you can build transistors  is a purely quantum phenomenon. So without that curiosity driven understanding of the structure of atoms  which led to this rather esoteric theory  quantum mechanics  then we wouldn't have transistors  we wouldn't have silicon chips  we wouldn't have pretty much the basis of our modern economy. There's one more  I think  wonderful twist to that tale. In  Wonders of the Solar System   we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal. It's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth  is you can transport it  not only to the planets  but to the most distant stars and galaxies. And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics  just by looking at the structure of atoms    the same theory that describes transistors    is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than  quite specifically   .  times the mass of the Sun. That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars. You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory  get a telescope  swing it to the sky  and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than  .  times the mass of the Sun. That's quite an incredible prediction. What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass  Well  this is a picture of it. This is the picture of a galaxy  a common  our garden  galaxy with  what      billion stars like our Sun in it. It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. There are a billion stars in the galactic core  which is why it's shining out so brightly. This is about    million light years away  so one of our neighboring galaxies. But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy. So that star is also    million light years away. It's part of that galaxy  and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it. That's a Type Ia supernova explosion. Now that's an incredible phenomena  because it's a star that sits there. It's called a carbon oxygen dwarf. It sits there about  say   .  times the mass of the Sun. And it has a binary companion that goes around it  so a big star  a big ball of gas. And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star  until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit  and then it explodes. And it explodes  and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks  and releases  not only energy  but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe. In fact  that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf. Now  there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang. And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars. It was made in stars like that  locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets  stars  new solar systems and  indeed  people like us. I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics  because we understand that process  because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth. This is a beautiful quote that I found    we're talking about serendipity there    from Alexander Fleming   When I woke up just after dawn on September           I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic.  Now  the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor. And they certainly didn't intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions  which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe. So  I think science can be    serendipity is important. It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things. It can also  I think  finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet. This is a spectacular picture of our home planet. Now  it doesn't look like our home planet. It looks like Saturn because  of course  it is. It was taken by the Cassini space probe. But it's a famous picture  not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings  but actually because of a tiny  faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings. And if I blow it up there  you see it. It looks like a moon  but in fact  it's a picture of Earth. It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn. That's our planet from     million miles away. I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it  the more beautiful it seems. But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet. It was taken by this thing  which is called the Voyager spacecraft. And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale. The Voyager is a tiny machine. It's currently    billion miles away from Earth  transmitting with that dish  with the power of    watts  and we're still in contact with it. But it visited Jupiter  Saturn  Uranus and Neptune. And after it visited all four of those planets  Carl Sagan  who's one of my great heroes  had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited. And it took this picture of Earth. Now it's very hard to see the Earth there  it's called the  Pale Blue Dot  picture  but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light. That's Earth from four billion miles away. And I'd like to read you what Sagan wrote about it  just to finish  because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken. He said   Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it  everyone you love  everyone you know  everyone you've ever heard of  every human being who ever was lived out their lives. The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions  ideologies and economic doctrines  every hunter and forager  every hero and coward  every creator and destroyer of civilization  every king and peasant  every young couple in love  every mother and father  hopeful child  inventor and explorer  every teacher of morals  every corrupt politician  every superstar  every supreme leader  every saint and sinner in the history of our species  lived there  on a mote of dust  suspended in a sunbeam. It's been said that astronomy's a humbling and character building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me  it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot  the only home we've ever known.  Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration. The argument has always been made  and it will always be made  that we know enough about the universe. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have had penicillin. You could have made it in the     s  you wouldn't have the transistor. And it's made today in these difficult economic times. Surely  we know enough. We don't need to discover anything else about our universe. Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine  Humphrey Davy  who did his science at the turn of the   th century. He was clearly under assault all the time.  We know enough at the turn of the   th century. Just exploit it  just build things.  He said this  he said   Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate  that our triumphs are complete  that there are no mysteries in nature  and that there are no new worlds to conquer.  Thank you. Hi there. I'm going to be talking a little bit about music  machines and life. Or  more specifically  what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video. Some of you may recognize this image. This is the opening frame of the video that we created. We'll be showing the video at the end  but before we do  I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted. Now  when we first started talking to OK Go    the name of the song is  This Too Shall Pass     we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with. And we were very excited about this because  of course  they have a history of dancing with machines. They're responsible for this video   Here It Goes Again.     million plus views on YouTube. Four guys dancing on treadmills  no cuts  just a static camera. A fantastically viral and wonderful video. So we were really excited about working with them. And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted. And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. Now  for those of you who don't know  a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption  an incredibly over engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task. So we were excited by this idea  and we started talking about exactly what it would look like. And we came up with some parameters  because  you know  building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations  but it also is pretty wide open. And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video. So we came up with a list of requirements  the     commandments   and they were  in order of ascending difficulty  The first is  No magic.  Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer. The rule of thumb was that  if my mother couldn't understand it  then we couldn't use it in the video. They wanted band integration  that is  the machine acting upon the band members  specifically not the other way around. They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling. So as the song picks up emotion  so should the machine get grander in its process. They wanted us to make use of the space. So we have this        square foot warehouse we were using  divided between two floors. It included an exterior loading dock. We used all of that  including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through. They wanted it messy  and we were happy to oblige. The machine itself would start the music. So the machine would get started  it would travel some distance  reacting along the way  hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback. And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout. And speaking of synchronization  they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way. Okay.  Laughter  They wanted it to end precisely on time. Okay  so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect. And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song. And as if that wasn't enough  all of these incredibly complicating things  right  they wanted it in one shot. Okay. So  just some statistics about what we went through in the process. The machine itself has    distinct interactions. It took us    takes to get it on film to our satisfaction. Of those    takes  only three actually successfully completed their run. We destroyed two pianos and    televisions in the process. We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times. And we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers  Heather Knight  left her high heeled shoe    after a nice dinner  and returned back to the build    and left it in a pile of stuff. And another engineer thought   Well  that would be a really good thing to use  and ended up using it as a really nice trigger. And it's actually in the machine. So what did we learn from all of this  Well  having completed this  we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things. And we learned that small stuff stinks. Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust  and they fall out of the tracks  the exact angles makes it hard to get right. And yet  a bowling ball will always follow the same path. It doesn't matter what temperature it is  doesn't matter what's in its way  it will pretty much get where it needs to go. But as much as the small stuff stinks  we needed somewhere to start  so that we would have somewhere to go. And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it. Small stuff stinks  but  of course  it's essential  right  What else  Planning is incredibly important. You know  we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things. It's been said that   No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.  I think our enemy was physics    and she's a cruel mistress. Often  we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever. And so while planning is important  so is flexibility. These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine. So also  put reliable stuff last  the stuff that's going to run every time. Again  small to large is relevant here. The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big  real car near the end of the video. The big  real car works every time  there's no problem about it. The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem. But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work  right. So you put that up front so that  if it fails  at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing. Life can be messy. There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing. Months were spent in this tiny  cold warehouse. And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it. So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad   This Too Shall Pass.  Thank you very much. And now to introduce their music video  we have OK Go. OK Go  An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. What are we doing  Oh  just hanging out with our Grammy. What what  It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC. We are OK Go. Have you read the  Natural Curiosity Cabinet   I mean   Curiosity     excuse me. Let me start again. We need some more ridiculous things besides  The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities.  Tim's sundial hat. Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers  Sorry  start again. Dogs. Hello  TEDxUSC. We are OK Go  and this our new video   This Too Shall Pass.   unclear  Kay  we can still do one better I think  yeah. That one's pretty good. It's getting better.   You know you can't keep letting it get you down     And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around     If there ain't all that much to lug around     Better run like hell when you hit the ground     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     You can't stop these kids from dancing     Why would you want to      Especially when you're already getting yours     Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend     Well don't go blaming the kids again     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     Let it go     This too shall pass     Let it go     This too shall pass     You know you can't keep letting it get you down     No  you can't keep letting it get you down     Let it go     This too shall pass     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes     When the morning comes   One thing the world needs  one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates. We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument. If you think about the arguments we have  most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television  ideological food fights on the floor of Congress. I have a suggestion. Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care  over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street  over the gap between rich and poor  over affirmative action and same sex marriage. Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments  with passions raging on all sides  are big questions of moral philosophy  big questions of justice. But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics. So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion. First  let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality  give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens  Aristotle's theory of justice  and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today. So  are you ready for the lecture  According to Aristotle  justice means giving people what they deserve. That's it  that's the lecture. Now  you may say  well  that's obvious enough. The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why. Take the example of flutes. Suppose we're distributing flutes. Who should get the best ones  Let's see what people    What would you say  Who should get the best flute  You can just call it out. Michael Sandel  At random. You would do it by lottery. Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them. Who else  MS  The best flute players.  Audience  The worst flute players.  MS  The worst flute players. How many say the best flute players  Why  Actually  that was Aristotle's answer too. But here's a harder question. Why do you think  those of you who voted this way  that the best flutes should go to the best flute players  Peter  The greatest benefit to all. MS  The greatest benefit to all. We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players. That's Peter   Audience  Peter.  MS  All right. Well  it's a good reason. We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music. But Peter  Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason. That's all right. Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players. He said  that's what flutes are for    to be played well. He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing  we have to reason about  and sometimes argue about  the purpose of the thing  or the social activity    in this case  musical performance. And the point  the essential nature  of musical performance is to produce excellent music. It'll be a happy byproduct that we'll all benefit. But when we think about justice  Aristotle says  what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing. One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy  but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians. Now  flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case. Let's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice. It had to do with golf. Casey Martin    a few years ago  Casey Martin    did any of you hear about him  He was a very good golfer  but he had a disability. He had a bad leg  a circulatory problem  that made it very painful for him to walk the course. In fact  it carried risk of injury. He asked the PGA  the Professional Golfers' Association  for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments. They said   No. Now that would give you an unfair advantage.  He sued  and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court  believe it or not  the case over the golf cart  because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated  provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity. He says   I'm a great golfer. I want to compete. But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next.  Suppose you were on the Supreme Court. Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case. How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart  And how many say  no  he doesn't  All right  let's take a poll  show of hands. How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin  And how many would not  How many would say he doesn't  All right  we have a good division of opinion here. Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart  what would be your reason  Raise your hand  and we'll try to get you a microphone. What would be your reason  MS  It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart. All right  those of you  I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage. What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart  How would you answer the objection  Yes  all right. Audience  The cart's not part of the game. MS  What's your name   Audience  Charlie.  MS  Charlie says    We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply. Tell us  Charlie  why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart  Charlie  The cart's not part of the game. MS  But what about walking from hole to hole  Charlie  It doesn't matter  it's not part of the game. MS  Walking the course is not part of the game of golf  Charlie  Not in my book  it isn't. MS  All right. Stay there  Charlie. Who has an answer for Charlie  All right  who has an answer for Charlie  What would you say  Audience  The endurance element is a very important part of the game  walking all those holes. MS  Walking all those holes  That's part of the game of golf   Audience  Absolutely.  MS  What's your name   Audience  Warren.  MS  Warren. Charlie  what do you say to Warren  Charley  I'll stick to my original thesis. MS  Warren  are you a golfer  Warren  I am not a golfer. Charley  And I am.  MS  Okay.  You know  it's interesting. In the case  in the lower court  they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue. Is walking the course essential to the game  And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And what do you suppose they all said  Yes. They agreed with Warren. They said  yes  walking the course is strenuous physical exercise. The fatigue factor is an important part of golf. And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart. Now  notice  something interesting    Well  I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. The Supreme Court decided. What do you suppose they said  They said yes  that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart. Seven to two  they ruled. What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right  the justice  of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf. And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question. And Justice Stevens  writing for the majority  said he had read all about the history of golf  and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible  and that walking was not essential  but incidental. Now  there were two dissenters  one of whom was Justice Scalia. He wouldn't have granted the cart  and he had a very interesting dissent. It's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion. He said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf. Here's how he put it.  To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object. But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement  that is  what distinguishes games from productive activity  it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential.  So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion. Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons. First  no real sports fan would talk that way. If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary  rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring  we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game. It's also objectionable on a second ground. On the face of it  it seemed to be    this debate about the golf cart    an argument about fairness  what's an unfair advantage. But if fairness were the only thing at stake  there would have been an easy and obvious solution. What would it be   Audience  Let everyone use the cart.  Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to. Then the fairness objection goes away. But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been  I suspect  more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA  even than making an exception for Casey Martin. Why  Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf  but  relatedly  the question  What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents  Let me put the point as delicately as possible  Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game. After all  there's no running or jumping  and the ball stands still. So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart  it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer  the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes. That illustrates that with golf  as with flutes  it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires  without grappling with the question   What is the essential nature of the activity in question  and what qualities  what excellences connected with that activity  are worthy of honor and recognition   Let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate  same sex marriage. There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman  and there are those who favor state recognition of same sex marriage. How many here favor the first policy  the state should recognize traditional marriage only  And how many favor the second  same sex marriage  Now  put it this way  What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage  The opponents of same sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage  fundamentally  is procreation  and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging. And the defenders of same sex marriage say no  procreation is not the only purpose of marriage  what about a lifelong  mutual  loving commitment  That's really what marriage is about. So with flutes  with golf carts  and even with a fiercely contested question like same sex marriage  Aristotle has a point. Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition. So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve  elevate  the terms of political discourse in the United States  and for that matter  around the world. There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics  that's a recipe for disagreement  and for that matter  a recipe for intolerance and coercion. So better to shy away from  to ignore  the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life. It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite  that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life  rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter. That  it seems to me  is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you. Chris. Thanks  Chris. Chris Anderson  From flutes to golf courses to same sex marriage    that was a genius link. Now look  you're a pioneer of open education. Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big. What's your vision for the next phase of this  MS  Well  I think that it is possible. In the classroom  we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions. And I think we can do that in public life more generally. And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course    it's available now  online  free for everyone anywhere in the world    and to see whether we can partner with institutions  at universities in China  in India  in Africa  around the world  to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate. CA  So you picture  at some point  live  in real time  you could have this kind of conversation  inviting questions  but with people from China and India joining in  MS  Right. We did a little bit of it here with       people in Long Beach  and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about       students. Wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing  engaging seriously with big moral questions  exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup  students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge  Massachusetts and create a global classroom. That's what I would love to do. CA  So  I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor. Michael Sandel. Thank you so much.  MS  Thanks so much.  In Africa we say   God gave the white man a watch and gave the black man time.  I think  how is it possible for a man with so much time to tell his story in    minutes  I think it will be quite a challenge for me. Most African stories these days  they talk about famine  HIV and AIDS  poverty or war. But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success. It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia. Namibia has got  .  million people  but it is only twice the size of California. I come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country. It's called Kunene region. And in the center of Kunene region is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born. This is where I'm coming from. Most people that are following the story of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt will know where Namibia is. They love Namibia for its beautiful dunes  that are even taller than the Empire State Building. Wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes  and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land. I'm a Himba. You might wonder  why are you wearing these Western clothes  I'm a Himba and Namibian. A Himba is one of the    ethnic groups in Namibia. We live a very traditional lifestyle. I grew up herding  looking after our livestock    goats  sheep and cattle. And one day  my father actually took me into the bush. He said   John  I want you to become a good herder. Boy  if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat    cheetah is very nervous    just walk up to it. Walk up to it and smack it on the backside.   And he will let go of the goat and run off.  But then he said   Boy  if you run into a lion  don't move. Don't move. Stand your ground. Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you.  But then  he said   If you see a leopard  boy  you better run like hell.   Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after.  In this way    In this way  I actually started to learn about nature. In addition to being an ordinary Namibian and in addition to being a Himba I'm also a trained conservationist. And it is very important if you are in the field to know what to confront and what to run from. I was born in     . We lived under apartheid regime. The whites could farm  graze and hunt as they wished  but we black  we were not regarded as responsible to use wildlife. Whenever we tried to hunt  we were called poachers. And as a result  we were fined and locked up in jail. Between      and       the U.S. and Soviet interests fought for control over my country. And you know  during war time  there are militaries  armies  that are moving around. And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns and tusks. They could sell these things for anything between        a kilo. During the same year almost every Himba had a rifle. Because it was wartime  the British .    rifle was just all over the whole country. Then in the same time  around       we had a very big drought. It killed almost everything that was left. Our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction  protected as well. We were hungry. I remember a night when a hungry leopard went into the house of one of our neighbors and took a sleeping child out of the bed. It's a very sad story. But even today  that memory is still in people's minds. They can pinpoint the exact location where this all happened. And then  in the same year  we almost lost everything. And my father said   Why don't you just go to school   And they sent me off to school  just to get busy somewhere there. And the year I went to school  my father actually got a job with a non governmental organization called IRDNC  Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation. They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities. They were trusted by the local communities like our leader  Joshua Kangombe. Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening  wildlife disappearing  poaching was skyrocketing  and the situation seemed very hopeless. Death and despair surrounded Joshua and our entire communities. But then  the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua  What if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife  Do you have anybody in your communities  or people  that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well  The headman said   Yes. Our poachers.   Eh  The poachers    Yes. Our poachers.  And that was my father. My father has been a poacher for quite a long time. Instead of shooting poachers dead like they were doing elsewhere in Africa  IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities to manage their peoples and their rights to own and manage wildlife. And thus  as people started feeling ownership over wildlife  wildlife numbers started coming back  and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia. With independence  the whole approach of community getting involved was embraced by our new government. Three things that actually help to build on this foundation  The very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas. Here is our tradition  At every Himba village  there is a sacred fire. And at this sacred fire  the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water  where to get grazings  and where to go and hunt. And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves on the environment. And here are the new ideas. Transporting rhinos using helicopters I think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see  isn't it  And these things we were taught by outsiders. We learned these things from outsiders. We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands  we needed to learn more things like GPS just to see whether    can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West  And we then wanted to see whether we can match our ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world. And through this  we actually started realizing our dreams  and we maintained honoring our traditions but we were still open to new ideas. The second element is that we wanted to have a life  a better life where we can benefit through many things. Most poachers  like my father  were people from our own community. They were not people from outside. These were our own people. And sometimes  once they were caught  they were treated with respect  brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams. The best one  like my father    I'm not campaigning for my father    they were put in charge to stop others from poaching. And when this thing started going on  we started becoming one community  renewing our connection to nature. And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. The last element that actually helped develop these things was the partnerships. Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands. The other partners that we have got is business communities. Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map and they have also helped make wildlife a very valuable land use like any other land uses such as agriculture. And most of my conservation colleagues today that you find in Namibia have been trained through the initiative  through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund in the most up to date conservation practices. They have also given funding for two decades to this whole program. And so far  with the support of World Wildlife Fund  we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today. Namibia ... or Sesfontein was no more an isolated village somewhere  hidden away in Namibia. With these assets we are now part of the global village. Thirty years have passed since my father's first job as a community game guard. It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success as I and my children see it today. When I finished school in       there were only    lions in the entire Northwest    in our area. But today  there are more than     lions. So please  if you go to Namibia  make sure that you stay in the tents. Don't walk out at night  The black rhino    they were almost extinct in     . But today  Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino    free roaming black rhinos    in the world. This is outside the protected area. The leopard    they are now in big numbers but they are now far away from our village  because the natural plain has multiplied  like zebras  springboks and everything. They stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals. What started as very small  community rangers getting community involved  has now grown into something that we call conservancies. Conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government  and these are run by the communities themselves  for their benefit. Today  we have got    conservancies that manage and protect over    million hectares of land in Namibia. We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country. Nowhere else in the world has community adopted conservation at this scale. In       conservancy generated  .  million dollars. This is our new economy    an economy based on the respect of our natural resources. And we are able to use this money for many things  Very importantly  we put it in education. Secondly  we put it for infrastructure. Food. Very important as well    we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education. You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses. And this is the good news from Africa that we have to shout from the rooftops. And now  what the world really needs is for you to help me and our partners take some of what we have learned in Namibia to other places with similar problems  places like Mongolia  or even in your own backyards  the Northern Great Plains  where buffalo and other animals have suffered and many communities are in decline. I like that one  Namibia serving as a model to Africa  and Africa serving as a model to the United States. We were successful in Namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife. We knew conservation would fail if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities. So  come and talk to me about Namibia  and better yet  come to Namibia and see for yourself how we have done it. And please  do visit our website to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM in Africa and across the world. Thank you very much. Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me. One of them was  Why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the Eurostar train when  for about    percent of that money  you could have top supermodels  male and female  serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey  You'd still have five billion left in change  and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down. Now  you may remember me asking the question as well  a very interesting observation  that actually those strange little signs that actually flash      at you  occasionally accompanying a little smiley face or a frown  according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit    those are actually more effective at preventing road accidents than speed cameras  which come with the actual threat of real punishment. So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work  I think  in many areas of human problem solving  particularly those which involve human psychology  which is  The tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible  as much compulsion as possible  whereas actually  the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied. So there seems to be a complete disconnect here. So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title    I'll come to this a little later    and perhaps the addition of a new word into the English language. Because it does seem to me that large organizations including government  which is  of course  the largest organization of all  have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people. Let me give you one example of this. You may remember this as the AOL Time Warner merger  okay  heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time. It may still be  for all I know. Now  all of you in this room  in one form or other  are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged. Just interested  did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all  So unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity  you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody  okay  By contrast  years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do  the most potent things are actually very  very small. This is from Virgin Atlantic upper class  it's the cruet salt and pepper set. Quite nice in itself  they're little  sort of  airplane things. What's really  really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought  which is   I reckon I can heist these.  However  you pick them up and underneath  actually engraved in the metal  are the words   Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper class.  Now  years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a     or an Airbus  you remember those words and that experience. Similarly  this is from a hotel in Stockholm  the Lydmar. Has anybody stayed there  It's the lift  it's a series of buttons in the lift. Nothing unusual about that at all  except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor. It starts with garage at the bottom  I suppose  appropriately  but it doesn't go up garage  grand floor  mezzanine  one  two  three  four. It actually says garage  funk  rhythm and blues. You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music. My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably     to       pounds max. It's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of         dollars  in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life. Now  these are trivial marketing examples  I accept. But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo  probably one of the leading experts in  effectively  the eradication of poverty in the developing world  actually spoke. And she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which  in a business context or a government context  would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing. It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by  not only making it a social event    I think good use of behavioral economics in that  if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated  your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone. But secondly  to incentivize that inoculation by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated. It's a tiny  tiny thing. If you're a senior person at UNESCO and someone says   So what are you doing to eradicate world poverty   you're not really confident standing up there saying   I've got it cracked  it's the lentils   are you  Our own sense of self aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important  and most of all  expensive solutions attached to them. And yet  what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very  very strong disproportionality at work  that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed  or the degree of force that's applied. But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality. So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very  very large budget. And once you have a very  very large budget  you actually look for expensive things to spend it on. What is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power  but no money at all. It's those people I'd quite like to create in the world going forward. Now  here's another thing that happens  which is what I call sometimes  Terminal   syndrome   which is that big  expensive things get big  highly intelligent attention  and they're great  and Terminal   is absolutely magnificent  until you get down to the small detail  the usability  which is the signage  which is catastrophic. You come out of  Arrive  at the airport  and you follow a big yellow sign that says  Trains  and it's in front of you. So you walk for another hundred yards  expecting perhaps another sign  that might courteously be yellow  in front of you and saying  Trains.  No  no  no  the next one is actually blue  to your left  and says  Heathrow Express.  I mean  it could almost be rather like that scene from the film  Airplane.  A yellow sign  That's exactly what they'll be expecting. Actually  what happens in the world increasingly    now  all credit to the British Airport Authority. I spoke about this before  and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said   Okay  what can you do   So I did come up with five suggestions  which they are actually actioning. One of them also being  although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it  if it only serves two floors  it's actually bloody terrifying  okay  Because when the door closes and there's nothing for you to do  you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. So these questions ... what is happening in the world is the big stuff  actually  is done magnificently well. But the small stuff  what you might call the user interface  is done spectacularly badly. But also  there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions. Because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as  strategy  to actually solve them. I tried this exercise recently  talking about banking. They said   Can we do an advertising campaign  What can we do and encourage more online banking   I said   It's really  really easy.  I said   When people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at. The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance.  I've got friends who actually never use their own bank cash machines because there's the risk that it might display their balance on the screen. Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news  Okay  you simply wouldn't. I said   If you make  actually  'Tell me my balance.' If you make that an option rather than the default  you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking  and they do it three times as often.  Let's face it  most of us    how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine  And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large. Now  interesting that no single person does that  or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it. But what's interesting about that suggestion was that  to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost    million pounds  it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure  it would actually cost about    quid. And yet  it never happens. Because there's a fundamental disconnect  as I said  that actually  the people with the power want to do big expensive things. And there's to some extent a big strategy myth that's prevalent in business now. And if you think about it  it's very  very important that the strategy myth is maintained. Because  if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors  it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success might actually lie somewhere else  in small pieces of tactical activity. But what is happening is that effectively    and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this  lots of things haven't helped this    business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy. It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate. It's a kind of mechanistic world that we'd all love to live in where  effectively  it sits very nicely on spreadsheets  everything is numerically expressible  and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success. That's the world people actually want. In truth  we do live in a world that science can understand. Unfortunately  the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases  very  very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects  and equally  vast areas of activity  enormous mergers  can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all. But it's very  very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world. But what I'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach. That is actually strategy  and I'm not denying that strategy has a role. You know  there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot. And I'd be wrong to dis that completely. Moving over  we come  of course  to consultancy. I thought it was very indecent of Accenture to ditch Tiger Woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way. I mean  Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model. He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services  no longer tied to a single monopoly provider  in many cases  sourcing things locally  and of course  the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load balancing. So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that  I'm not sure. Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing. That's called trivia. But there's a fourth thing. And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff. We don't know what to call it. And actually we don't spend nearly enough money looking for those things  looking for those tiny things that may or may not work  but which  if they do work  can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense  their efforts and the disruption they cause. So the first thing I'd like is a competition    to anybody watching this as a film    is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right. And the second thing  I think  is that the world needs to have people in charge of that. That's why I call for the  Chief Detail Officer.  Every corporation should have one  and every government should have a Ministry of Detail. The people who actually have no money  who have no extravagant budget  but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay  but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible English. And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail and business actually had Chief Detail Officers  then that fourth quadrant  which is so woefully neglected at the moment  might finally get the attention it deserves. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  We're having a debate. The debate is over the proposition   What the world needs now is nuclear energy.  True or false  And before we have the debate  I'd like to actually take a show of hands    on balance  right now  are you for or against this  So those who are  yes   raise your hand.  For.  Okay  hands down. Those who are against  raise your hands. Okay  I'm reading that at about    to    in favor at the start. Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts  if at all. So here's the format  They're going to have six minutes each  and then after one little  quick exchange between them  I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have    seconds to make one short  crisp  pungent  powerful point. So  in favor of the proposition  possibly shockingly  is one of  truly  the founders of the environmental movement  a long standing TEDster  the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog  someone we all know and love  Stewart Brand. Stewart Brand  Whoa. The saying is that with climate  those who know the most are the most worried. With nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried. A classic example is James Hansen  a NASA climatologist pushing for     parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He came out with a wonderful book recently called  Storms of My Grandchildren.  And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously. This is the design situation  a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. Look at the client base for this. Five out of six of us live in the developing world. We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. And we are educating our kids  having fewer kids  basically good news all around. But we move to cities  toward the bright lights  and one of the things that is there that we want  besides jobs  is electricity. And if it isn't easily gotten  we'll go ahead and steal it. This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside. Electricity for cities  at its best  is what's called baseload electricity. That's where it is on all the time. And so far there are only three major sources of that    coal and gas  hydro electric  which in most places is maxed out    and nuclear. I would love to have something in the fourth place here  but in terms of constant  clean  scalable energy   solar  and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant. Nuclear is and has been for    years. Now  from an environmental standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal  the two major sources of electricity. If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear  the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a Coke can    a pretty heavy Coke can  about two pounds. But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one gigawatt coal fired plant. Then what happens to the waste  The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet. It's just as well  because it can stay where it is. While the carbon dioxide  vast quantities of it  gigatons  goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back    yet    and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. So when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources  nuclear is down there with wind and hydro  below solar and way below  obviously  all the fossil fuels. Wind is wonderful  I love wind. I love being around these big wind generators. But one of the things we're discovering is that wind  like solar  is an actually relatively dilute source of energy. And so it takes a very large footprint on the land  a very large footprint in terms of materials  five to    times what you'd use for nuclear  and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of     square miles of wind farm. In places like Denmark and Germany  they've maxed out on wind already. They've run out of good sites. The power lines are getting overloaded. And you peak out. Likewise  with solar  especially here in California  we're discovering that the    solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze       square miles of southern California desert. Well  as an environmentalist  we would rather that didn't happen. It's okay on frapped out agricultural land. Solar's wonderful on rooftops. But out in the landscape  one gigawatt is on the order of    square miles of bulldozed desert. When you add all these things up    Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get    clean terawatts of energy from wind  solar and biofuels  and that area would be roughly the size of the United States  an area he refers to as  Renewistan.  A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay  a physicist in England  and in his wonderful book   Sustainable Energy   among other things  he says   I'm not trying to be pro nuclear. I'm just pro arithmetic.  In terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy. We have been taking down the Russian warheads  turning it into electricity. Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. We haven't even started the American stockpile. I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small  down around    to     megawatts. This is one from Toshiba. Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. And that would be very interesting in the developing world. Typically  these things are put in the ground. They're referred to as nuclear batteries. They're incredibly safe  weapons proliferation proof and all the rest of it. Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion  and another one from Oregon called NuScale. Babcock   Wilcox that make nuclear reactors  here's an integral fast reactor. Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive  and these will go ahead. And here's the future. CA  Okay. Okay. So arguing against  a man who's been at the nitty  gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. In       he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming  after CO . His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. His first time at TED  possibly a disadvantage    we shall see    from Stanford  Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. Mark Jacobson  Thank you. So my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide  puts out more air pollutants  enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems  namely wind  solar  geothermal power  hydro tidal wave power. And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. So let's start just by looking at the CO  emissions from the life cycle. CO e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO . And if you look  wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO  emissions  if you look at the graph. Nuclear    there are two bars here. One is a low estimate  and one is a high estimate. The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. The high is the average of     scientific  peer reviewed studies. And this is just the CO  from the life cycle. If we look at the delays  it takes between    and    years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for actual construction. And in China  right now  they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. And the average  just for the construction time of these  is  .  years on top of any planning times. While you're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric power grid  which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid  resulting if you use nuclear  or anything else  versus wind  CSP or photovoltaics. Wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics. So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind  or something else. So if you add these two together  alone  you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to    times more CO  equivalent emissions than wind energy. And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. If you look at the air pollution health effects  this is the number of deaths per year in      just from vehicle exhaust. Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E  . Well  right now in the United States     to         people die per year from air pollution  and vehicles are about        of those. In       the number will go down to        due to improvements. And so  on the right  you see gasoline emissions  the death rates of     . If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol  you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. If you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction  but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation  because we know for example  India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. North Korea did that to some extent. Iran is doing that right now. And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city  megacity  the additional death rates due to this averaged over    years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. would be this. So  do we need this  The next thing is  What about the footprint  Stewart mentioned the footprint. Actually  the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. That  because the footprint  as you can see  is just the pole touching the ground. And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with        to         five megawatt wind turbines. That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground  entirely. The spacing is something else. That's the footprint that is always being confused. People confuse footprint with spacing. As you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space. Over the ocean  it's not even land. Now if we look at nuclear     Laughter  With nuclear  what do we have  We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone that's    square kilometers. And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. Now if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind. For example  cellulosic ethanol  to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet  this is how much land you would need. That's cellulosic  second generation biofuels from prairie grass. Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. This is based on ranges from data  but if you look at nuclear  it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. For wind  there's a larger area  but much smaller footprint. And of course  with wind  you could put it all over the East Coast  offshore theoretically  or you can split it up. And now  if you go back to looking at geothermal  it's even smaller than both  and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it's still pretty small. And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. To power the entire world with    percent wind  you would need about one percent of world land. Matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant. We want to match the hour by hour power supply. You can do that by combining renewables. This is from real data in California  looking at wind data and solar data. And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand. Here are the world wind resources. There's five to    times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. So then here's the final ranking. And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice  You can either have wind or nuclear. If you use wind  you guarantee ice will last. Nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. And we can guarantee a clean  blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. CA  All right. So while they're having their comebacks on each other    and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran    I need two people from either side. So if you're for this  if you're for nuclear power  put up two hands. If you're against  put up one. And I want two of each for the mics. Now then  you guys have    you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said  challenge it  whatever. SB  I think a point of difference we're having  Mark  has to do with weapons and energy. These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases    a lot of those studies include   Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that   which is kind of finessing it a little bit  I think. The reality is that there's  what     nations that have nuclear power  Of those  seven have nuclear weapons. In every case  they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. There are two nations  North Korea and Israel  that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. The places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are China  India  Europe  North America  all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons. So that leaves a couple of places like Iran  maybe Venezuela  that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is  and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that. CA  Mark     seconds  either on that or on anything Stewart said. MJ  Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. So the other thing is  we don't need nuclear energy. There's plenty of solar and wind. You can make it reliable  as I showed with that diagram. That's from real data. And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science. Solving the world's problems can be done  if you really put your mind to it and use clean  renewable energy. There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. CA  We need someone for. Rod Beckstrom  Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom  CEO of ICANN. I've been involved in global warming policy since       when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. I've come around in the last    years. I used to be against nuclear power. I'm now supporting Stewart's position  softly  from a risk management standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident  which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. However  I think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate  and that is  we face a situation where it's carbon caps on this planet or die. And in the United States Senate  we need bipartisan support    only one or two votes are needed    to move global warming through the Senate  and this room can help. So if we get that through  then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. CA  Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. David Fanton  Hi  I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. The first is  be aware of the propaganda. The propaganda from the industry has been very  very strong. And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. Be very aware of the propaganda. Secondly  think about this. If we build all these nuclear power plants  all that waste is going to be on hundreds  if not thousands  of trucks and trains  moving through this country every day. Tell me they're not going to have accidents. Tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years. And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn't a potential terrorist target. CA  Thank you. For. Anyone else for  Go. Alex  Hi  I'm Alex. I just wanted to say  I'm  first of all  renewable energy's biggest fan. I've got solar PV on my roof. I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. And I'm  you know  very much  pro  that kind of stuff. However  there's a basic arithmetic problem here. The capability of the sun shining  the wind blowing and the rain falling  simply isn't enough to add up. So if we want to keep the lights on  we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time. I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '  s  and I continue to do so now. But we've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time. And  ultimately  the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. We need a solution that generates all of the time. If we're going to keep the lights on  nuclear is that solution. CA  Thank you. Anyone else against  Man  The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources. And our  against  proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. I will also add one other thing. Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks    we know that the stick is going up exponentially. So you can't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say   That's all we have.  Because five years from now  it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible  disastrous nuclear power. CA  Point well made. Thank you. So each of you has really just a couple sentences       seconds each to sum up. Your final pitch  Stewart. SB  I loved your  It all balances out  chart that you had there. It was a sunny day and a windy night. And just now in England they had a cold spell. All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. None of those things were stirring. And as usual  they had to buy nuclear power from France. Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel. This keeps happening. I used to worry about the        year factor. And the fact is  we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along. And especially the small reactors need to go forward. I heard from Nathan Myhrvold    and I think here's the action point    it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors  which we need very much  here and in the world. MJ  So we've analyzed the hour by hour power demand and supply  looking at solar  wind  using data for California. And you can match that demand  hour by hour  for the whole year almost. Now  with regard to the resources  we've developed the first wind map of the world  from data alone  at    meters. We know what the wind resources are. You can cover    percent. Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive. And there's much more solar than there is wind. There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. CA  Okay. So  thank you  Mark. So if you were in Palm Springs ... Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. So  people of the TED community  I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. All those in favor  raise your hands. And all those against. Ooooh. Now that is    my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up  people who changed their minds during the debate  who voted differently. Those of you who changed your mind in favor of  for  put your hands up. Okay. So here's the read on it. Both people won supporters  but on my count  the mood of the TED community shifted from about    to    to about    to    in favor  in favor. You both won. I congratulate both of you. Thank you for that. This is the venue where  as a young man  some of the music that I wrote was first performed. It was  remarkably  a pretty good sounding room. With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere  it actually sounded pretty good. This is a song that was recorded there. This is not Talking Heads  in the picture anyway. So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood. The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood. The sound system was kind of decent. And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room. So the rhythms could be pretty intact too  pretty concise. Other places around the country had similar rooms. This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville. The music was in some ways different  but in structure and form  very much the same. The clientele behavior was very much the same too. And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough    the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down  shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing. Since then  I've played other places that are much nicer. I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that. And it's been very exciting. But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written  or was writing at the time  didn't sound all that great in some of those halls. We managed  but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made. So I asked myself  Do I write stuff for specific rooms  Do I have a place  a venue  in mind when I write  Is that a kind of model for creativity  Do we all make things with a venue  a context  in mind  Okay  Africa. Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa. And the music there  I would say  the instruments  the intricate rhythms  the way it's played  the setting  the context  it's all perfect. It all works perfect. The music works perfectly in that setting. There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms. The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification  etc.  etc. It's no accident. It's perfect for that particular context. And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral. In a gothic cathedral  this kind of music is perfect. It doesn't change key  the notes are long  there's almost no rhythm whatsoever  and the room flatters the music. It actually improves it. This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ. It's not as big as a gothic cathedral  so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate. He can  very innovatively  actually change keys without risking huge dissonances. This is a little bit later. This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in. I think we're in like       somewhere around there. They're smaller  even less reverberant  so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate    and it works. It fits the room perfectly. This is La Scala. It's around the same time  I think it was built around     . People in the audience in these opera houses  when they were built  they used to yell out to one another. They used to eat  drink and yell out to people on the stage  just like they do at CBGB's and places like that. If they liked an aria  they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore  not at the end of the show  but immediately. And well  that was an opera experience. This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself. And the size of the room is not that big. It's smaller than this. But Wagner made an innovation. He wanted a bigger band. He wanted a little more bombast  so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments in there. Okay. This is Carnegie Hall. Obviously  this kind of thing became popular. The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair sized. It's larger than some of the other symphony halls. And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala. Around the same  according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker  this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet    no more eating  drinking and yelling at the stage  or gossiping with one another during the show. They had to be very quiet. So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls. It meant that there could be extreme dynamics  which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music. Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting. But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall  the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural. This is Mahler. It looks like Bob Dylan  but it's Mahler. That was Bob's last record  yeah. Popular music  coming along at the same time. This is a jazz band. According to Scott Joplin  the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs. Again  it's noisy. They're playing for dancers. There's certain sections of the song    the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked. And they'd say   Play that part again.  Well  there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers. So the bands started to improvise new melodies. And a new form of music was born. These are played mainly in small rooms. People are dancing  shouting and drinking. So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that. Same thing goes true for    that's the beginning of the century    for the whole of   th century popular music  whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.  Live music  doesn't really change that much. It changes about a third of the way into the   th century  when this became one of the primary venues for music. And this was one way that the music got there. Microphones enabled singers  in particular  and musicians and composers  to completely change the kind of music that they were writing. So far  a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music  but singers  like Frank Sinatra  could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone. Other singers after him went even further. This is Chet Baker. And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone. It would have been impossible without recorded music as well. And he's singing right into your ear. He's whispering into your ears. The effect is just electric. It's like the guy is sitting next to you  whispering who knows what into your ear. So at this point  music diverged. There's live music  and there's recorded music. And they no longer have to be exactly the same. Now there's venues like this  a discotheque  and there's jukeboxes in bars  where you don't even need to have a band. There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever  and the sound systems are good. People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems. And  as with jazz  the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others. So the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections. The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies. And another new form of music was born. Live performance  when it was incredibly successful  ended up in what is probably  acoustically  the worst sounding venues on the planet  sports stadiums  basketball arenas and hockey arenas. Musicians who ended up there did the best they could. They wrote what is now called arena rock  which is medium speed ballads. They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for. The tempos are medium. It sounds big. It's more a social situation than a musical situation. And in some ways  the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly. So there's more new venues. One of the new ones is the automobile. I grew up with a radio in a car. But now that's evolved into something else. The car is a whole venue. The music that  I would say  is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it. It might not be what you want to listen to at home  but it works great in the car    has a huge frequency spectrum  you know  big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle. Automobile music  you can share with your friends. There's one other kind of new venue  the private MP  player. Presumably  this is just for Christian music. And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall  or when the audience had to hush up  because you can now hear every single detail. In other ways  it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP  player gets too quiet  you turn it up  and the next minute  your ears are blasted out by a louder passage. So that doesn't really work. I think pop music  mainly  it's written today  to some extent  is written for these kind of players  for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail  but the dynamic doesn't change that much. So I asked myself  Okay  is this a model for creation  this adaptation that we do  And does it happen anywhere else  Well  according to David Attenborough and some other people  birds do it too    that the birds in the canopy  where the foliage is dense  their calls tend to be high pitched  short and repetitive. And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls  so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor. And birds like this Savannah sparrow  they tend to have a buzzing type call. And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs. Other birds  like this tanager  have adapted within the same species. The tananger on the East Coast of the United States  where the forests are a little denser  has one kind of call  and the tananger on the other side  on the west has a different kind of call. So birds do it too. And I thought  Well  if this is a model for creation  if we make music  primarily the form at least  to fit these contexts  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls  and if we write software to fit existing operating systems  is that how it works  Yeah. I think it's evolutionary. It's adaptive. But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there. This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view. The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion  and then somehow it gets shaped into something. And I'm saying  well  the passion's still there  but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into  that is instinctively and intuitively created first. We already know where that passion is going. But this conflict of views is kind of interesting. The writer  Thomas Frank  says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests  that voters  like a lot of us  assume  that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere  that it's coming from the gut  that it's passionate  that it's more authentic. And they'll vote for that. So that  if somebody can fake sincerity  if they can fake passion  they stand a better chance of being selected in that way  which seems a little dangerous. I'm saying the two  the passion  the joy  are not mutually exclusive. Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds. We adapt. We sing. And like the birds  the joy is still there  even though we have changed what we do to fit the context. Thank you very much. So since I was here last in '    we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue  so we covered that fairly extensively in Skeptic magazine. We investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi scientific controversies  but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this because the world's going to end in     . Another update  You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker. It's like a water dowsing device. It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around. And you walk around  and it points to things. Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers  it'll point right to somebody. Oh  sorry.  Laughter  This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls  especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes. Well  under the category of  What's the harm of silly stuff like this   this device  the ADE      was sold to the Iraqi government for        dollars apiece. It's just like this one  completely worthless  in which it allegedly worked by  electrostatic magnetic ion attraction   which translates to  pseudoscientific baloney     would be the nice word    in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good  but it does absolutely nothing. In this case  at trespass points  allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay  actually cost lives. So there is a danger to pseudoscience  in believing in this sort of thing. So what I want to talk about today is belief. I want to believe  and you do too. And in fact  I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things. It is the default option. We just believe. We believe all sorts of things. Belief is natural  disbelief  skepticism  science  is not natural. It's more difficult. It's uncomfortable to not believe things. So like Fox Mulder on  X Files   who wants to believe in UFOs  Well  we all do  and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains. Essentially  we are pattern seeking primates. We connect the dots  A is connected to B  B is connected to C. And sometimes A really is connected to B  and that's called association learning. We find patterns  we make those connections  whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food  and then he salivates to the sound of the bell  or whether it's a Skinnerian rat  in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it  and therefore he repeats the behavior. In fact  what Skinner discovered is that  if you put a pigeon in a box like this  and he has to press one of these two keys  and he tries to figure out what the pattern is  and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there    if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern  they will figure out any kind of pattern. And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward  they repeat that particular pattern. Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise  once clockwise and peck the key twice. And that's called superstition  and that  I'm afraid  we will always have with us. I call this process  patternicity     that is  the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise. When we do this process  we make two types of errors. A Type I error  or false positive  is believing a pattern is real when it's not. Our second type of error is a false negative. A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is. So let's do a thought experiment. You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa. Your name is Lucy  okay  And you hear a rustle in the grass. Is it a dangerous predator  or is it just the wind  Your next decision could be the most important one of your life. Well  if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind  you've made an error in cognition  made a Type I error  false positive. But no harm. You just move away. You're more cautious. You're more vigilant. On the other hand  if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind  and it turns out it's a dangerous predator  you're lunch. You've just won a Darwin award. You've been taken out of the gene pool. Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error. This is the only equation in the talk by the way. We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic  especially in split second  life and death situations. So the default position is just  Believe all patterns are real    All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind. And so I think that we evolved ... there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines  our pattern seeking brain processes  to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to. So for example  what do you see here  It's a horse head  that's right. It looks like a horse. It must be a horse. That's a pattern. And is it really a horse  Or is it more like a frog  See  our pattern detection device  which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex    it's our little detection device there    can be easily fooled  and this is the problem. For example  what do you see here  Yes  of course  it's a cow. Once I prime the brain    it's called cognitive priming    once I prime the brain to see it  it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it. And what do you see here  Some people see a Dalmatian dog. Yes  there it is. And there's the prime. So when I go back without the prime  your brain already has the model so you can see it again. What do you see here  Planet Saturn. Yes  that's good. How about here  Just shout out anything you see. That's a good audience  Chris. Because there's nothing in this. Well  allegedly there's nothing. This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U.T. Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns. That is  almost everybody sees the planet Saturn. People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this  which is allegedly patternless. In other words  the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control. For example  baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting  but not so much when they're fielding. Because fielders are successful    to    percent of the time. The best batters fail seven out of    times. So their superstitions  their patternicities  are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth. What do you see in this particular one here  in this field  Anybody see an object there  There actually is something here  but it's degraded. While you're thinking about that  this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore  a psychologist in England  who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test  How much did they believe in the paranormal  supernatural  angels and so forth. And those who scored high on the ESP scale  tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns. Here is what you show subjects. The fish is degraded    percent     percent and then the one I showed you     percent. A similar experiment was done by another  Swiss  psychologist named Peter Brugger  who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere  via the left visual field  than the left hemisphere. So if you present subjects the images such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left  then they're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere. Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs. So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens. Brugger and his colleague  Christine Mohr  gave subjects L DOPA. L DOPA's a drug  as you know  given for treating Parkinson's disease  which is related to a decrease in dopamine. L DOPA increases dopamine. An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine. So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity. In fact  neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior  things like paranoia  delusions and hallucinations  these are patternicities. They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors. And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists  they go away. That is  you decrease the amount of dopamine  and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases. On the other hand  amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists. They increase the amount of dopamine. So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state  creativity  find more patterns. In fact  I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine  when he had that issue  than now. So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity. Dopamine  I think  changes our signal to noise ratio. That is  how accurate we are in finding patterns. If it's too low  you're more likely to make too many Type II errors. You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical. If you're too skeptical  you'll miss the really interesting good ideas. Just right  you're creative  and yet you don't fall for too much baloney. Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere. Every time somebody looks at you  you think people are staring at you. You think people are talking about you. And if you go too far on that  that's just simply labeled as madness. It's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates  Richard Feynman and John Nash. One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize. The other one also  but maybe too many patterns. And we then call that schizophrenia. So the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem. And of course you all know exactly what this is  right  And what pattern do you see here  Again  I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here  causing you conflicting pattern detections. You know  of course  this is Via Uno shoes. These are sandals. Pretty sexy feet  I must say. Maybe a little Photoshopped. And of course  the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth. It turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see. And you see the lamp here  I know. Because the lights on here. Of course  thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals. So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is  of course  the dolphins  right  You see a dolphin here  and there's a dolphin  and there's a dolphin. That's a dolphin tail there  guys. If we can give you conflicting data  again  your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive. If you look down here  it's fine. If you look up here  then you get conflicting data. And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a set up. The impossible crate illusion. It's easy to fool the brain in  D. So you say   Aw  come on Shermer  anybody can do that in a Psych     text with an illusion like that.  Well here's the late  great Jerry Andrus'  impossible crate  illusion in  D  in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate. And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal. Of course  camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there  and this board appears to overlap with this one  and this one with that one  and so on. But even when I take it away  the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns. This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle. In fact  it's the exact same picture side by side. So what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one  but with that one. And so your brain is fooled. Yet again  your pattern detection devices are fooled. Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes. Here's some faces on the side of a rock. I'm actually not even sure if this is    this might be Photoshopped. But anyway  the point is still made. Now which one of these looks odd to you  In a quick reaction  which one looks odd  The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right. And you are correct. A fairly famous illusion    it was first done with Margaret Thatcher. Now  they trade up the politicians every time. Well  why is this happening  Well  we know exactly where it happens  in the temporal lobe  right across  sort of above your ear there  in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus. And there's two types of cells that do this  that record facial features either globally  or specifically these large  rapid firing cells  first look at the general face. So you recognize Obama immediately. And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth. Especially when they're upside down  you're engaging that general facial recognition software there. Now I said back in our little thought experiment  you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa. Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator  What's the difference between those  Well  the wind is inanimate  the dangerous predator is an intentional agent. And I call this process agenticity. That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning  intention and agency  often invisible beings from the top down. This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here  Dan Dennett  who talked about taking the intentional stance. So it's a type of that expanded to explain  I think  a lot of different things  souls  spirits  ghosts  gods  demons  angels  aliens  intelligent designers  government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention  are believed to haunt our world and control our lives. I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism. It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us  more moral than us  and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high. The intelligent designer's always portrayed as this super intelligent  moral being that comes down to design life. Even the idea that government can rescue us    that's no longer the wave of the future  but that is  I think  a type of agenticity  projecting somebody up there  big and powerful  will come rescue us. And this is also  I think  the basis of conspiracy theories. There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings  whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers. But this is a pattern detection problem  isn't it  Some patterns are real and some are not. Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin  Well  if you go there    there's people there on any given day    like when I went there  here    showing me where the different shooters were. My favorite one was he was in the manhole. And he popped out at the last second  took that shot. But of course  Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy. So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that. Because  let's face it  some patterns are real. Some conspiracies really are true. Explains a lot  maybe. And      has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy. We did a whole issue on it. Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy. But that's not what the       truthers  think. They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration. Well  that's a whole other lecture. You know how we know that      was not orchestrated by the Bush administration  Because it worked. So we are natural born dualists. Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these. Because we can imagine  in essence  continuing on. We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe  you can produce a feeling of out of body experiences  near death experiences  which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there. Or you can do it through loss of consciousness  by accelerating in a centrifuge. You get a hypoxia  or a lower oxygen. And the brain then senses that there's an out of body experience. You can use    which I did  went out and did    Michael Persinger's God Helmet  that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves. And you get a sense of out of body experience. So I'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together. It's just a minute and a half. It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief. Go ahead and roll it. Narrator  This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm. Woman  We're hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial  right  And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here. And these are our models who are going to help us  Roger and Matt. And we have our own lip balm  and we have a leading brand. Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it  Girl  No. Woman  You wouldn't   Girl  No.  Woman  You'd think that was fine. Girl  That would be fine.  Woman  Okay.  So this is a blind test. I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on. Kay  now can you see anything   Girl  No.  Pull it so you can't even see down.  Girl  Okay.  Woman  It's completely blind now  right  Girl  Yes.  Woman  Okay.  Now  what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips  the texture  right  and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. Girl  Okay.  Woman  Have you ever done a kissing test before   Girl  No. Woman  Take a step here. Okay  now I'm going to ask you to pucker up. Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit  okay  Woman  Okay. And  Jennifer  how did that feel  Jennifer  Good. Girl  Oh my God  Michael Shermer  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks. So  if you're in the audience today  or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place  you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem. Whether you're an artist  a technologist  a lawyer or a fan  the handling of copyright directly impacts your life. Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership  it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape. YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners  but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies  mashups and more  we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works. Two years ago  recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single  Forever.  A fan saw it on TV  recorded it with her camera phone  and uploaded it to YouTube. Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system  within seconds of attempting to upload the video  the copy was detected  giving Sony the choice of what to do next. But how do we know that the user's video was a copy  Well  it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database  along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match. We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database. This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works. Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content. The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match. This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file  plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality. And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube. And that's over    hours of video every minute. When we find a match  we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking. We're not just talking about a few videos  we're talking about over     years of video every day  between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site. When we compare those hundred years of video  we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database. It would be like        people staring at        monitors each and every day  without so much as a coffee break. Now  what do we do when we find a match  Well  most rights owners  instead of blocking  will allow the copy to be published. And then they benefit through the exposure  advertising and linked sales. Remember Chris Brown's video  Forever   Well  it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts  and that looked like the end of the story  but sometime last year  a young couple got married. This is their wedding video. You may have seen it. What's amazing about this is  if the processional of the wedding was this much fun  can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been  I mean  who are these people  I totally want to go to that wedding. So their little wedding video went on to get over    million views. And instead of Sony blocking  they allowed the upload to occur. And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes. And the song     months old  went back to number four on the iTunes charts. So Sony is generating revenue from both of these. And Jill and Kevin  the happy couple  they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral. And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows  and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference. The video's inspired over        dollars in donations to end domestic violence. The  JK Wedding  Entrance  Dance  became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of  The Office   which just goes to show  it's truly an ecosystem of culture. Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios  but sometimes big studios borrowing back. By empowering choice  we can create a culture of opportunity. And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification. So why has no one ever solved this problem before  It's because it's a big problem  and it's complicated and messy. It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners. There's musical labels. There's multiple music publishers. And each of these can vary by country. There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together. So we have to manage many claims to the same video. YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases. But the system only works through the participation of rights owners. If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube  you should register in the Content ID system  and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used. And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content. By simply blocking all reuse  you'll miss out on new art forms  new audiences  new distribution channels and new revenue streams. But it's not just about dollars and impressions. Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology. And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins. Since we are such a visual species  it's hard for us to really understand this  so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it. But let's also think  as a visual species  what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving and try to look underwater. We really can't see very far. Our vision  which works so well in air  all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic. And what marine mammals have evolved over the last tens of millions of years is ways to depend on sound to both explore their world and also to stay in touch with one another. Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation. They can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient. They can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat. All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch. So the large baleen whales will produce long  beautiful songs  which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females  both to find one another and to select a mate. And mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another  so sound is really critical for their lives. The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals  whose world was so foreign to me  was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds. And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds. Here's the first example. This is a plot of frequency against time    sort of like musical notation  where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower  and time goes this way. This is a picture of a trainer's whistle  a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish. It sounds sort of like  tweeeeeet.  Like that. This is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer's whistle. If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat and it hummed it back to you  you ought to be pretty surprised. Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds. It's really important for our music and our language. So it's a puzzle  The few other mammal groups that do this  why do they do it  A lot of my career has been devoted to trying to understand how these animals use their learning  use the ability to change what you say based on what you hear in their own communication systems. So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate. Many mammals have to produce contact calls when  say  a mother and calf are apart. This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys when they're isolated from another one. And you can see  there's not much variability in these calls. By contrast  the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch  each individual here has a radically different call. They can use this ability to learn calls in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls to identify individuals. How about the setting in which animals need to use this call  Well let's look at mothers and calves. In normal life for mother and calf dolphin  they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish  and when they separate they have to get back together again. What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle  against the maximum distance. So when dolphins are separating by less than    meters  less than half the time they need to use whistles. Most of the time they can just find each other just by swimming around. But all of the time when they separate by more than     meters  they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again. Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin. But there are some exceptions. When a male dolphin leaves Mom  it will often join up with another male and form an alliance  which may last for decades. As these two animals form a social bond  their distinctive whistles actually converge and become very similar. This plot shows two members of a pair. As you can see at the top here  they share an up sweep  like  woop  woop  woop.  They both have that kind of up sweep. Whereas these members of a pair go  wo ot  wo ot  wo ot.  And what's happened is they've used this learning process to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group. It's a very interesting way that they can form a new identifier for the new social group that they've had. Let's now take a step back and see what this message can tell us about protecting dolphins from human disturbance. Anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded  and clearly his behavior is being disrupted. This is a bad situation. But it turns out that when just a single boat is approaching a group of dolphins at a couple hundred meters away  the dolphins will start whistling  they'll change what they're doing  they'll have a more cohesive group  wait for the boat to go by  and then they'll get back to normal business. Well  in a place like Sarasota  Florida  the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes. So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this  it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work. And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia  Lars Bider has done work comparing dolphin behavior and distribution before there were dolphin watching boats. When there was one boat  not much of an impact. And two boats  When the second boat was added  what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely. Of the ones that stayed  their reproductive rate declined. So it could have a negative impact on the whole population. When we think of marine protected areas for animals like dolphins  this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign. We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems. I'd also like to point out that sound doesn't obey boundaries. So you can draw a line to try to protect an area  but chemical pollution and noise pollution will continue to move through the area. And I'd like to switch now from this local  familiar  coastal environment to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean. This is a kind of map we've all been looking at. The world is mostly blue. But I'd also like to point out that the oceans are much more connected than we think. Notice how few barriers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land. To me  the most mind bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean comes from an acoustic experiment where oceanographers took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean  deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound. That same sound traveled to the west  and could be heard in Bermuda  and traveled to the east  and could be heard in Monterey    the same sound. So we live in a world of satellite communication  are used to global communication  but it's still amazing to me. The ocean has properties that allow low frequency sound to basically move globally. The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours. It's nearly halfway around the globe. In the early '  s  Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician published a theoretical paper pointing out that it was possible that sound could transmit over these large areas  but very few biologists believed it. It actually turns out  though  even though we've only known of long range propagation for a few decades  the whales clearly have evolved  over tens of millions of years  a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean. So blue whales and fin whales produce very low frequency sounds that can travel over very long ranges. The top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males. They form songs  and they appear to play a role in reproduction  sort of like that of song birds. Down below here  we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges. The biologists continued to be skeptical of the long range communication issue well past the '  s  until the end of the Cold War. What happened was  during the Cold War  the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time  that they used to track Russian submarines. It had deep underwater microphones  or hydrophones  cabled to shore  all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic. And after the Berlin Wall fell  the Navy made these systems available to whale bio acousticians to see what they could hear. This is a plot from Christopher Clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by Bermuda  went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again. It was tracked for    days  swimming       kilometers  or more than       miles. This shows us both that the calls are detectable over hundreds of miles and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles. They're ocean based and scale animals who are communicating over much longer ranges than we had anticipated. Unlike fins and blues  which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans  the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds  so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency  broader band and more complicated. So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here. Humpbacks  when they develop the ability to sing this song  they're listening to other whales and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing  just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described. This means that humpback song is a form of animal culture  just like music for humans would be. I think one of the most interesting examples of this comes from Australia. Biologists on the east coast of Australia were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area. And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks. In '   they all sang the normal song. But in '   they heard a few weird songs  and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales. The west coast calls became more and more popular  until by       none of the whales sang the east coast song  it was completely gone. They just sang the cool new west coast song. It's as if some new hit style had completely wiped out the old fashioned style before  and with no golden oldies stations. Nobody sang the old ones. I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls. Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark   .  miles away from a humpback. You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud. You sound very nearby. The next recording you're going to hear was made of the same humpback song    miles away. That's shown down here. You only hear the low frequencies. You hear the reverberation as the sound travels over long range in the ocean and is not quite as loud. Now after I play back these humpback calls  I'll play blue whale calls  but they have to be sped up because they're so low in frequency that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise. Here's a blue whale call at    miles  which was distant for the humpback. It's loud  clear    you can hear it very clearly. Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone     miles away. There's a lot of noise  which is mostly other whales. But you can still hear that faint call. Let's now switch and think about a potential for human impacts. The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean comes from shipping. This is the sound of a ship  and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it. Imagine that whale listening from     miles. There's a potential problem that maybe this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales from being able to hear each other. Now this is something that's been known for quite a while. This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound. And on the y axis is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean by frequency. In the low frequencies  this line indicates sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth. Up high  these variable lines indicate increasing noise in this frequency range from higher wind and wave. But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot  the noise is dominated by human ships. Now think about it. This is an amazing thing  That in this frequency range where whales communicate  the main source globally  on our planet  for the noise comes from human ships  thousands of human ships  distant  far away  just all aggregating. The next slide will show what the impact this may have on the range at which whales can communicate. So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale. And as we get farther away  the sound gets fainter and fainter. Now in the pre industrial ocean  as we were mentioning  this whale call could be easily detected. It's louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers. Let's now take that additional increase in noise that we saw comes from shipping. All of a sudden  the effective range of communication goes from a thousand kilometers to    kilometers. Now if this signal is used for males and females to find each other for mating and they're dispersed  imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of endangered populations. Whales also have contact calls like I described for the dolphins. I'll play the sound of a contact call used by right whales to stay in touch. And this is the kind of call that is used by  say  right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again. Now imagine    let's put the ship noise in the picture. What's a mother to do if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there  I'll describe a couple strategies. One strategy is if your call's down here  and the noise is in this band  you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better. Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this. She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic. Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '  s. Look what happened by      to the average call. Same thing in the North Atlantic  in the '  s versus     . Over the last    years  as we've put more noise into the oceans  these whales have had to shift. It's as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor. It's an amazing shift  induced by humans over this large scale  in both time and space. And we now know that whales can compensate for noise by calling louder  like I did when that ship was playing  by waiting for silence and by shifting their call out of the noise band. Now there's probably costs to calling louder or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be  and there's probably lost opportunities. If we also have to wait for silence  they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate. So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate  or are not able to perform critical functions. It's a really important problem. And I'm happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area  looking at the impact of shipping on whales. In terms of the shipping noise  the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations has formed a group whose job is to establish guidelines for quieting ships  to tell the industry how you could quiet ships. And they've already found that by being more intelligent about better propeller design  you can reduce that noise by    percent. If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull  you can reduce that noise by    percent. So at this point  it's primarily an issue of cost and standards. If this group can establish standards  and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships  we can now see a gradual decline in this potential problem. But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here  and that's the problem of collision. This is a whale that just squeaked by a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision. But collision is a serious problem. Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision  and it's very important to try to reduce this. I'll discuss two very promising approaches. The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy. These black lines mark shipping lanes in and out of the Bay of Fundy. The colorized area shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales because of the ships moving in this lane. It turns out that this lane here goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time  and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision. Well  biologists who couldn't take no for an answer went to the International Maritime Organization and petitioned them to say   Can't you move that lane  Those are just lines on the ground. Can't you move them over to a place where there's less of a risk   And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly   These are the new lanes.  The shipping lanes have been moved. And as you can see  the risk of collision is much lower. So it's very promising  actually. We can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks. Another action which was just taken independently by a shipping company itself was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming. The Maersk Line looked at their competition and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money. They rush as fast as they can to get to their port. But then they often wait there. What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down. They could slow down by about    percent. This reduced their fuel consumption by about    percent  which saved them money  and at the same time  it had a significant benefit for whales. It you slow down  you reduce the amount of noise you make and you reduce the risk of collision. So to conclude  I'd just like to point out  you know  the whales live in an amazing acoustic environment. They've evolved over tens of millions of years to take advantage of this. And we need to be very attentive and vigilant to thinking about where things that we do may unintentionally prevent them from being able to achieve their important activities. At the same time  we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems. I hope these examples have shown some of the different directions we can take in addition to protected areas to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate. Thank you very much. I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school. I struggled with school. But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing  and I was raised to be an entrepreneur  and what I've been really passionate about ever since    and I've never spoken about this ever  until now    so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it  except my wife three days ago  because she said   What are you talking about   and I told her    is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits  and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing. It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified  which is what happens in a lot of society. Kids  when we grow up  have dreams  and we have passions  and we have visions  and somehow we get those things crushed. We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor. My parents got me a tutor in French  and I still suck in French. Two years ago  I was the highest rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program. And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world. When I was in grade two  I won a city wide speaking competition  but nobody had ever said   Hey  this kid's a good speaker. He can't focus  but he loves walking around and getting people energized.  No one said   Get him a coach in speaking.  They said  get me a tutor in what I suck at. So as kids show these traits    and we need to start looking for them    I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers. Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say   Hey  let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor   and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says   Hey  be an entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurs are people    because we have a lot of them in this room    who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it. And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen. We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us  and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial  we could change everything in the world that is a problem today. Every problem that's out there  somebody has the idea for. And as a young kid  nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out. I think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish    the old parable   If you give a man a fish  you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish  you feed him for a lifetime.  If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial    the ones that show those traits to be    like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science  what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs  We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts. What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do  Don't hit  don't bite  don't swear. Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs  you know  and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot. And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo  Crosby. Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs. The reason that I avoided an MBA program    other than the fact that I couldn't get into any because I had a    percent average out of high school and then    percent average at the only school in Canada that accepted me  Carlton    but our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs. They teach them to go work in corporations. So who's starting these companies  It's these random few people. Even in popular literature  the only book I've ever found    and this should be on all of your reading lists    the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is  Atlas Shrugged.  Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people. I look at even my family. Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs. My dad was an entrepreneur. Both my brother and sister and I  all three of us own companies as well. And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit. We didn't fit in the normal work. We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits. But kids could be entrepreneurs as well. I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization. I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference  and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school. I have    out of the    signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed. So this thing right here is freaking me out. It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now    other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar    but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur. Attention deficit disorder  bipolar disorder. Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease  Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it. All three of the founders of Netscape had it. I could go on and on. Kids    you can see these signs in kids. And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying   Don't be an entrepreneurial type. Fit into this other system and try to become a student.  Sorry  entrepreneurs aren't students. We fast track. We figure out the game. I stole essays. I cheated on exams. I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for    consecutive assignments. But as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting  you hire accountants. So I just figured that out earlier. At least I can admit I cheated in university  most of you won't. I'm also quoted    and I told the person who wrote the textbook    I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies. In managerial accounting  I'm chapter eight. I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting. And I told the author  after they did my interview  that I cheated in that same course. And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway. But kids  you can see these signs in them. The definition of an entrepreneur is  a person who organizes  operates and assumes the risk of a business venture.  That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program. It doesn't mean you have to get through school. It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut. And we've heard those things about  is it nurture or is it nature   right  Is it thing one or thing two  What is it  Well  I don't think it's either. I think it can be both. I was groomed as an entrepreneur. When I was growing up as a young kid  I had no choice  because I was taught at a very early  young age    when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school    that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age. He groomed us  the three of us  to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people. My first little business venture  I was seven years old  I was in Winnipeg  and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords. And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers. And my mom came into the room and she said   Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners   And I said   Let's go and look in the basement.  And we went down to the basement. And I opened up this cupboard. And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected. Because  when I told her I was going out to play with the kids  I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell. Because I saw her a few weeks before that    you could get paid. They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger. So I was just like  well there's all kinds of coat hangers. And so I'll just go get them. And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them  so I just did it anyway. And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people. This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half. I even knew at a seven year old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent  and people would pay that because it multiplied up. At seven years old I figured it out. I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers. I sold license plate protectors door to door. My dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale. And at nine years old  I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses. And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients. I sold newspapers. And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever. But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector. And he's like   Well  we don't need one.  And I said   But you've got two cars ...     I'm nine years old. I'm like   But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors.  And he said   I know.  And I said   This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up.  And he said   Yes  that's my wife's car.  And I said   Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer.  So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each. If I couldn't sell all four  I could at least get one. I learned that at a young age. I did comic book arbitrage. When I was about    years old  I sold comic books out of our cottage on Georgian Bay. And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids. And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids. But it was obvious to me  right  Buy low  sell high. You've got this demand over here that has money. Don't try to sell to the poor kids  they don't have cash. The rich people do. Go get some. So that's obvious  right. It's like a recession. So  there's a recession. There's still    trillion dollars circulating in the U.S. economy. Go get some of that. And I learned that at a young age. I also learned  don't reveal your source  because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from  and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more. I was forced to get a paper route at    years old. I didn't really want a paper route  but at     my dad said   That's going to be your next business.  So not only would he get me one  but I had to get two  and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers  which I did  and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money. So I would collect the tips and get payment. So I would go and collect for all the papers. He could just deliver them. Because then I realized I could make the money. By this point  I was definitely not going to be an employee. My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop. He had all these old automotive parts lying around. They had this old brass and copper. I asked him what he did with it  and he said he just throws it out. I said   But wouldn't somebody pay you for that   And he goes   Maybe.  Remember at    years old    so    years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff. I saw there was money in garbage. And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle. And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid. And I thought that was kind of cool. Strangely enough     years later  we're building       GOT JUNK  and making money off that too. I built these little pincushions when I was    years old in Cubs  and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day. And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins    when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside. And you'd make these chairs. And I had these little pillows that I would sew up. And you could stuff pins in them. Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion. But what I realized was that you had to have options. So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown. And then when I went to the door  it wasn't   Do you want to buy one   It was   Which color would you like   Like I'm    years old  you're not going to say no to me  especially if you have two options    you have the brown one or the clear one. So I learned that lesson at a young age. I learned that manual labor really sucks. Right  like cutting lawns is brutal. But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that  I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing. That if I land this client once  and every week I get paid by that person  that's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person. Because you can't sell them more. So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age. Remember  I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs. I would caddy  I would go to the golf course and caddy for people. But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course  the   th hole that had this huge hill. And people could never get their bags up it. So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies. I would carry their golf bags up to the top  and they'd pay me a dollar. Meanwhile  my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy's bag around and get paid    bucks. I'm like   That's stupid because you have to work for five hours. That doesn't make any sense.  You just figure out a way to make more money faster. Every week  I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops. Then I would go up and deliver them to these    year old women playing bridge. And they'd give me their orders for the following week. And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice. And I had this captured market. You didn't need contracts. You just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you. These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me  and I kind of figured it out. I went and got golf balls from golf courses. But everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls. I'm like  screw that. They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond. So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes. You just pick them up with both feet. You can't do it on stage. You get the golf balls  and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them. But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls. So I just packaged them. I'm like     right  I packaged them up three ways. I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then. Those sold for two dollars each. And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy. They were    cents each. And then I'd sell    at a time of all the crappy ones. And they could use those for practice balls. I sold sunglasses  when I was in school  to all the kids in high school. This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time. But it paid the bills. So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses. Then when the school shut me down    the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it    so I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers. That was cool because then I had retail outlets. And I think I was   . Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins door to door. You know that you can hold a    ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin  So what  right  Yeah  but you know what  You stuff that down your shorts  when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free  everybody bought them. Supply  demand  big opportunity. I also branded it  so I sold them for five times the normal cost. It had our university logo on it. You know we teach our kids and we buy them games  but why don't we get them games  if they're entrepreneurial kids  that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs  Why don't you teach them not to waste money  I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff  Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street  and my dad said   Go pick it up.  He said   I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny.  And I remember that lesson to this day. Allowances teach kids the wrong habits. Allowances  by nature  are teaching kids to think about a job. An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck. Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck. That's wrong  for me  if you want to raise entrepreneurs. What I do with my kids now    I've got two  nine and seven    is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard  looking for stuff that needs to get done. Come to me and tell me what it is. Or I'll come to them and say   Here's what I need done.  And then you know what we do  We negotiate. They go around looking for what it is. But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid. And then they don't have a regular check  but they have more opportunities to find more stuff  and they learn the skill of negotiating  and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well. You breed that kind of stuff. Each of my kids has two piggy banks. Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want. The    percent that goes in their house account  every six months  goes to the bank. They walk up with me. Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker. Both my nine  and seven year olds have a stock broker already. But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit. It drives me crazy that    year olds are saying   Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now.  Shit  you've missed    years. You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet. Don't read them bedtime stories every night. Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories. Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items  a red shirt  a blue tie  a kangaroo and a laptop  and have them tell a story about those four things  My kids do that all the time. It teaches them to sell  it teaches them creativity  it teaches them to think on their feet. Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it. Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk  even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches. Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing. Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like. Show them the grumpy employees. When you see grumpy customer service  point that out to them. Say   By the way  that guy's a crappy employee.  And say   These ones are good ones.  If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service  show them what bad customer service looks like. We have all these lessons in front of us  but we don't take those opportunities  we teach kids to go get a tutor. Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now  all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said   Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji   And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in. They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever. But teach them how to fix the price  guess the price  pull up the photos. Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money. Then the money they get     percent goes in their house account     percent goes in their toy account. My kids love this stuff. Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids  attainment  tenacity  leadership  introspection  interdependence  values. All these traits you can find in young kids  and you can help nurture them. Look for that kind of stuff. There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system. Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really  really freaking bad. The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression  unless it is so clinically brutal  man. Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease. When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it  and they built Netscape    imagine if they were given Ritalin. We wouldn't have have that stuff  right  Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet. These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else. I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers. But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well  Because there's huge opportunities in that. I want to close with a quick little video. It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor. These guys  Grasshopper. It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship. Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world.  Kid ...  And you thought you could do anything     You still can.   Because a lot of what we consider impossible ...   ... is easy to overcome   Because in case you haven't noticed  we live in a place where   One individual can make a difference   Want proof    Just look at the people who built our country    Our parents  grandparents  our aunts  uncles ...   They were immigrants  newcomers ready to make their mark   Maybe they came with very little   Or perhaps they didn't own anything except for ...   ... a single brilliant idea   These people were thinkers  doers ...   ... innovators ...   ... until they came up with the name ...   ... entrepreneurs    They change the way we think about what is possible.   They have a clear vision of how life can be better   for all of us  even when times are tough.   Right now  it's hard to see ...   ... when our view is cluttered with obstacles.   But turbulence creates opportunities   for success  achievement  and pushes us ...   to discover new ways of doing things   So what opportunities will you go after and why    If you're an entrepreneur   you know that risk isn't the reward.   No. The rewards are driving innovation ...   ... changing people's lives. Creating jobs.   Fueling growth.   And making a better world.   Entrepreneurs are everywhere.   They run small businesses that support our economy    design tools to help you ...   ... stay connected with friends  family and colleagues around the world.   And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems.   Do you know an entrepreneur    Entrepreneurs can be anyone ...   Even ... you    So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted   Help heal the economy   Make a difference.   Take your business to new heights.   But most importantly    remember when you were a kid ...   when everything was within you reach    and then say to yourself quietly  but with determination     It still is.   Thank you very much for having me.  Sanskrit  This is an ode to the mother goddess  that most of us in India learn when we are children. I learned it when I was four at my mother's knee. That year she introduced me to dance  and thus began my tryst with classical dance. Since then    it's been four decades now    I've trained with the best in the field  performed across the globe  taught young and old alike  created  collaborated  choreographed  and wove a rich tapestry of artistry  achievement and awards. The crowning glory was in       when I received this country's fourth highest civilian award  the Padma Shri  for my contribution to art. But nothing  nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July     . I heard the word  carcinoma.  Yes  breast cancer. As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office  I heard other words   cancer    stage    grade.  Until then  Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend  stage was what I performed on  and grades were what I got in school. That day  I realized I had an unwelcome  uninvited  new life partner. As a dancer  I know the nine rasas or the navarasas  anger  valor  disgust  humor and fear. I thought I knew what fear was. That day  I learned what fear was. Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control  I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband  Jayant. I said   Is this it  Is this the end of the road  Is this the end of my dance   And he  the positive soul that he is  said   No  this is just a hiatus  a hiatus during the treatment  and you'll get back to doing what you do best.  I realized then that I  who thought I had complete control of my life  had control of only three things  My thought  my mind    the images that these thoughts created    and the action that derived from it. So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you  with the enormity of the situation  wanting to go to a place of healing  health and happiness. I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  for which I needed something. I needed something that would pull me out of all this. So I dried my tears  and I declared to the world at large ... I said   Cancer's only one page in my life  and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life.  I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out  and I would not allow cancer to ride me. But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be  I needed something. I needed an anchor  an image  a peg to peg this process on  so that I could go from there. And I found that in my dance  my dance  my strength  my energy  my passion  my very life breath. But it wasn't easy. Believe me  it definitely wasn't easy. How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days  How do you not despair when  with the body ravaged by chemotherapy  climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture  that to someone like me who could dance for three hours  How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all  All I wanted to do was curl up and weep. But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have. So I would drag myself into my dance studio    body  mind and spirit    every day into my dance studio  and learn everything I learned when I was four  all over again  reworked  relearned  regrouped. It was excruciatingly painful  but I did it. Difficult. I focused on my mudras  on the imagery of my dance  on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself. And slowly  I moved out of that miserable state of mind. But I needed something else. I needed something to go that extra mile  and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four. The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini  of Durga. Durga  the mother goddess  the fearless one  created by the pantheon of Hindu gods. Durga  resplendent  bedecked  beautiful  her    arms ready for warfare  as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur. Durga  the epitome of creative feminine energy  or shakti. Durga  the fearless one. I made that image of Durga and her every attribute  her every nuance  my very own. Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training  I brought laser sharp focus into my dance  laser sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery. I danced through chemo and radiation cycles  much to the dismay of my oncologist. I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule. What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance. Yes  cancer has just been one page in my life. My story is a story of overcoming setbacks  obstacles and challenges that life throws at you. My story is the power of thought. My story is the power of choice. It's the power of focus. It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you  so moves you  that something even like cancer becomes insignificant. My story is the power of a metaphor. It's the power of an image. Mine was that of Durga  Durga the fearless one. She was also called Simhanandini  the one who rode the lion. As I ride out  as I ride my own inner strength  my own inner resilience  armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment  as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer  asking my rogue cells to behave  I want to be known not as a cancer survivor  but as a cancer conqueror. I present to you an excerpt of that work  Simhanandini.  I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the   st century. In the   st century  we need to actually look at    and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today    is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count. But I think it's time for us to think about what we count. Because what we actually count truly counts. Let me start by telling you a little story. This is Van Quach. She came to this country in      from Vietnam. She changed her name to Vivian because she wanted to fit in here in America. Her first job was at an inner city motel in San Francisco as a maid. I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there. So Vivian and I have been working together for    years. With the youthful idealism of a    year old  in       I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre  a very impractical name  because I actually was looking to create joy of life. And this first hotel that I bought  motel  was a pay by the hour  no tell motel in the inner city of San Francisco. As I spent time with Vivian  I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work. It made me question and curious  How could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living  So I spent time with Vivian  and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets. Her job  her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber. What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests. And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home. Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home. That very human lesson  more than    years ago  served me well during the last economic downturn we had. In the wake of the dotcom crash and       San Francisco Bay Area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of American hotels. We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area  so we were particularly vulnerable. But also back then  remember we stopped eating French fries in this country. Well  not exactly  of course not. We started eating  freedom fries   and we started boycotting anything that was French. Well  my name of my company  Joie de Vivre    so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company. And I'd write them back  and I'd say   What a minute. We're not French. We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco.  And I'd get a terse response   Oh  that's worse.  So one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre  I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices. And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution. But given my befuddled state of mind  I ended up in the self help section very quickly. That's where I got reacquainted with Abraham Maslow's  hierarchy of needs.  I took one psychology class in college  and I learned about this guy  Abraham Maslow  as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs. But as I sat there for four hours  the full afternoon  reading Maslow  I recognized something that is true of most leaders. One of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect  and that is that we're all human. Each of us  no matter what our role is in business  has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace. So as I started reading more Maslow  what I started to realize is that Maslow  later in his life  wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective  to organizations and specifically to business. But unfortunately  he died prematurely in       and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely. So I realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow. And that's what I did a few years ago when I took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid  which is survival  success and transformation. It's not just fundamental in business  it's fundamental in life. And we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs  these transformational needs for our key employees in the company. These three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers  I realized we had no metrics. We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right. So we started asking ourselves  What kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees' sense of meaning  or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us  For example  we actually started asking our employees  do they understand the mission of our company  and do they feel like they believe in it  can they actually influence it  and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it  We started asking our customers  did they feel an emotional connection with us  in one of seven different kinds of ways. Miraculously  as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid  what we found is we created more loyalty. Our customer loyalty skyrocketed. Our employee turnover dropped to one third of the industry average  and during that five year dotcom bust  we tripled in size. As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time  what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure. What we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid. They didn't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid. So I started asking myself the question  How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible  If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure  and all we can measure is the tangible in life  we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. So I went out and studied a bunch of things  and I found a survey that showed that    percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business  things like intellectual property  their corporate culture  their brand loyalty  and yet  only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business. So as leaders  we understand that intangibles are important  but we don't have a clue how to measure them. So here's another Einstein quote   Not everything that can be counted counts  and not everything that counts can be counted.  I hate to argue with Einstein  but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued  aren't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane  It was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan peaks. I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries  a place some folks call Shangri La. It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world. I went to Bhutan. The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man  but this was back in       when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away. At age     he started asking the kinds of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. On a trip through India  early in his reign as king  he was asked by an Indian journalist about the Bhutanese GDP  the size of the Bhutanese GDP. The king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later. He said the following  he said   Why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product  Why don't we care more about gross national happiness   Now  in essence  the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success  what has come to be known as GNH  or gross national happiness. Most world leaders didn't take notice  and those that did thought this was just  Buddhist economics.  But the king was serious. This was a notable moment  because this was the first time a world leader in almost     years had suggested that intangible of happiness    that leader     years ago  Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence        years later  this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure  and it's something we should actually value as government officials. For the next three dozen years as king  this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan    including  just recently  taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed  no coup. Bhutan  for those of you who don't know it  is the newest democracy in the world  just two years ago. So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement  I got to really understand what they're doing. And I got to spend some time with the prime minister. Over dinner  I asked him an impertinent question. I asked him   How can you create and measure something which evaporates    in other words  happiness   And he's a very wise man  and he said   Listen  Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness. We create the conditions for happiness to occur. In other words  we create a habitat of happiness.  Wow  that's interesting. He said that they have a science behind that art  and they've actually created four essential pillars  nine key indicators and    different metrics that help them to measure their GNH. One of those key indicators is  How do the Bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day  It's a good question. How do you feel about how you spend your time each day  Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world. And yet  of course  that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. As I spent my week up in the Himalayas  I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation. And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel. How many know him  Anybody        he wrote a book called  The Real Enjoyment of Living   and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want  instead  it's about wanting what you have. Or in other words  I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have    imagine gratitude    divided by having what you want    gratification. The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill  constantly focused on what they don't have. Their religion  their isolation  their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their GNH movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have. How many of us here  as TEDsters in the audience  spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation  in the denominator  We are a bottom heavy culture in more ways than one. The reality is  in Western countries  quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out    an object that we're supposed to get  or maybe many objects. Actually  in fact  if you look in the dictionary  many dictionaries define pursuit as to  chase with hostility.  Do we pursue happiness with hostility  Good question. But back to Bhutan. Bhutan's bordered on its north and south by    percent of the world's population. Could this little country  like a startup in a mature industry  be the spark plug that influences a   st century of middle class in China and India  Bhutan's created the ultimate export  a new global currency of well being  and there are    countries around the world today that are studying their own GNH. You may have heard  this last fall Nicolas Sarkozy in France announcing the results of an    month study by two Nobel economists  focusing on happiness and wellness in France. Sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on GDP and consider a new index  what some French are calling a  joie de vivre index.  I like it. Co branding opportunities. Just three days ago  three days ago here at TED  we had a simulcast of David Cameron  potentially the next prime minister of the UK  quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time  Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from      when he suggested that we're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric. So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote  and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here. This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote. GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods. But it doesn't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials. As you look at these two columns here  doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count  a new way to imagine what's important to us in life  Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that. He said GDP  measures everything in short  except that which makes life worthwhile.  Wow. So how do we do that  Let me say one thing we can just start doing ten years from now  at least in this country. Why in the heck in America are we doing a census in       We're spending    billion dollars on the census. We're asking    simple questions    it is simplicity. But all of those questions are tangible. They're about demographics. They're about where you live  how many people you live with  and whether you own your home or not. That's about it. We're not asking meaningful metrics. We're not asking important questions. We're not asking anything that's intangible. Abe Maslow said long ago something you've heard before  but you didn't realize it was him. He said   If the only tool you have is a hammer  everything starts to look like a nail.  We've been fooled by our tool. Excuse that expression. We've been fooled by our tool. GDP has been our hammer. And our nail has been a   th  and   th century industrial era model of success. And yet     percent of the world's GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service  the service industry  the industry I'm in. And only    percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture. So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox  right  Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted  the tangible in life  but actually counts what we most value  the things that are intangible. I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO. I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad. I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same. They aren't the same. In fact  as leaders  what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling. In Vivian's case  her unit of production isn't the tangible hours she works  it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work. This is Dave Arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel. He stayed there a hundred times in the last    years  and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him. They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave. He tells me that he can always count on Vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home. Why is it that business leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business  We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits  we can have both. In fact  inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits  right  So what the world needs now  in my opinion  is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count. We count numbers. We count on people. What really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people. I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country. What can you start counting today  What one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life  whether it's your work life or your business life  Thank you very much. I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.  Oh beloved dentist  Your rubber fingers in my mouth ... your voice so soft and muffled ... Lower the mask  dear dentist  lower the mask.  Okay  in this presentation  I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout. You're going to see a lot of imagery  and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about  so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other. So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story. Six years ago  after    years in graphic design and typography  I changed the way I was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work  with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that I loved. But something weird happened. I became bizarrely popular. My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on. And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it. These days  I call myself a graphic artist. So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy  my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client. Now  this is heresy in the design world. The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design. But I find that for myself  without exception  the more I deal with the work as something of my own  as something that is personal  the more successful it is as something that's compelling  interesting and sustaining. So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking. Where others might look at measurable results  I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities  like  Does it bring joy    Is there a sense of wonder   and  Does it invoke curiosity   This is a scientific diagram  by the way. I don't have time to explain it  but it has to do with DNA and RNA. So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work. The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure  surprise and anything that requires figuring things out. So for this reason  I'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns. I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works. This is a piece that I did for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. They have a magazine that they call G . And this is for their puzzle special in     . And puzzling it is. I started by creating a series of tiling units. And these tiling units  I designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that I could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning. But then as well  I was able to just flip them  rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns. So here's the word puzzle again. And here it is with the abstract surrounding. And as you can see  it's extremely difficult to read. But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern. But maybe that's a little too obvious. So then I can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves  and this way  working with the art director  I'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience    they can figure out that there's something they have to read    but it's not impossible for them to read. I'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways. So this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will. So ultimately  my goal is to create something unexpected. To this end  I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister  three time TED speaker. And this project began essentially on my kitchen table. I've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life. And for that same amount of time  I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers. And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork. And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book   Things in My Life I've Learned So Far.  And these were created without sketches  just freehand  by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it. Recently  I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta. And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book  and the chapter is on honor. So it's a little bit unexpected  but  in a way  it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents  which is in itself a form of honor. This is what you can do with some household tinfoil. Okay  well  it's what I can do with some household tinfoil. I'm very interested in wonder  in design as an impetus to inquiring. To say I wonder is to say I question  I ask. And to experience wonder is to experience awe. So I'm currently working on a book  which plays with both senses of the word  as I explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock like grandeur. The world is full of wonder. But the world of graphic design  for the most part  is not. So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force. I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message. I think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature  and I'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth. When we look at works like this  we tend to associate them with children's literature. There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content. But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception. This book is taking rather a long time  but I'm nearly done. For some reason  I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk. And this is it    just to give you and me a moment to catch up. So I do these valentines. I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since     . These are my valentines from      and     . And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person. But in       I got the cockamamie idea to hand draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list. I reduced my mailing list to     people. And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out. Believe it or not  I devised this as a timesaving method. I was very busy in the beginning of that year  and I didn't know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine. And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling. It didn't exactly work out that way. There's a longer story to this  but I did get them all done in time  and they were extremely well received. I got an almost     percent response rate. And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again. Last year  I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine. I had this idea that I wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter  like a found fragment in their mailbox. I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me  something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was. And I specifically wrote four pages that don't connect. There were four different versions of this. And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence  end in the middle of a sentence. And they're on the one hand  universal  so I avoid specific names or places  but on the other hand  they're personal. So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them. And I'm just going to read one of them to you.  You've never really been sure of this  but I can assure you that this quirk you're so self conscious of is intensely endearing. Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile  and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing. Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds  but without the scratches and bird shit.   That is to say  your thoughts and words flit and dart  disconcertedly elusive at times  but when caught and examined    ahh  such a wonder  such a delightful reward. There's no passing time with you  only collecting    the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release. Impossible  I don't think so. I know this makes you embarrassed. I'm certain I can see you blushing. But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self doubt  and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are  how inspiring and delightful and really  truly the most completely ...  So Valentine's Day is coming up in a couple of days  and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world. This year  I got  what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea  to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards. So I solicited friends to send me their used Christmas cards  and I made     of these. Each one of them is completely different. I'm just really  really thrilled with them. I don't have that much else to say  but they turned out really well. I do spend a lot of time on my work. And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is what is worth while. What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way  Working in the commercial world  this is something that I do have to struggle with at times. And yes  sometimes I'm swayed by money. But ultimately  I don't consider that a worthy goal. What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with  the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach. So I might ask   Who is it for    What does it say   and  What does it do   You know  I have to tell you  it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds  who are thinking these really big picture  world changing  life changing ideas and technologies. And it's very  very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough  or worse  that all we're doing is contributing to landfill. Here I am  I'm showing you some pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics. But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society. Just in the way that I'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds  conversations I have  movies  so I also think  when I put visual work out there into the mass media  work that is interesting  unusual  intriguing  work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind  that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace. And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else  because inspiration is cross pollinating. So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist  and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter. And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure  and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure. But I really believe that a fully operating  rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing. So that's why I do what I do  and why I spend so much time and effort on it  and why I work in the commercial  public sphere  as opposed to the isolated  private sphere of fine art  because I want as many people as possible to see my work  notice it  be drawn into it  and be able to take something from it. And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this Earth in this way. And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you. It's a great pleasure to be here. It's a great pleasure to speak after Brian Cox from CERN. I think CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider. What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider  Where is the Small Hadron Collider  Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing. Now  the Small Hadron Collider is in a cupboard  overlooked and neglected. You know when the Large Hadron Collider started  and it didn't work  and people tried to work out why  it was the Small Hadron Collider team who sabotaged it because they were so jealous. The whole Hadron Collider family needs unlocking. The lesson of Brian's presentation  in a way    all those fantastic pictures    is this really  that vantage point determines everything that you see. What Brian was saying was science has opened up successively different vantage points from which we can see ourselves  and that's why it's so valuable. So the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see. The question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get. And so if you ask this question  Where would you look to see the future of education  The answer that we've traditionally given to that is very straightforward  at least in the last    years  You go to Finland. Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems. The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate  but by golly  they are qualified. And they have absolutely amazing education systems. So we all troop off to Finland  and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it  and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back. Well  so  for this last year  with the help of Cisco who sponsored me  for some balmy reason  to do this  I've been looking somewhere else. Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best  but it often comes from places where you have huge need    unmet  latent demand    and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work    traditional  high cost solutions  which depend on professionals  which is what schools and hospitals are. So I ended up in places like this. This is a place called Monkey Hill. It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio. Most of the population growth of the next    years will be in cities. We'll grow by six cities of    million people a year for the next    years. Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world. Almost all of that growth will be in places like Monkey Hill. This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world. So if you want recipes to work    for virtually anything    health  education  government politics and education    you have to go to these places. And if you go to these places  you meet people like this. This is a guy called Juanderson. At the age of     in common with many    year olds in the Brazilian education system  he dropped out of school. It was boring. And Juanderson  instead  went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived  which was the drugs trade. And by the age of     with rapid promotion  he was running the drugs trade in    favelas. He was turning over         dollars a week. He employed     people. He was going to be dead by the age of   . And luckily  he met this guy  who is Rodrigo Baggio  the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.       Rodrigo started something called CDI  which took computers donated by corporations  put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this. What turned Juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible. Or you can go to places like this. This is Kibera  which is the largest slum in East Africa. Millions of people living here  stretched over many kilometers. And there I met these two  Azra on the left  Maureen on the right. They just finished their Kenyan certificate of secondary education. That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system borrows almost everything from Britain  circa       but has managed to make it even worse. So there are schools in slums like this. They're places like this. That's where Maureen went to school. They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums. And the education they got was pitiful. It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns in another slum called Nakuru. Half the children in this classroom have no parents because they've died through AIDS. The other half have one parent because the other parent has died through AIDS. So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain. They are to stay alive  to earn a living  to not become HIV positive. The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology. It's not to do with electricity or water. It's the mobile phone. If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in Africa  you would start now with the mobile phone. Or you could go to places like this. This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony  which is a very developed slum about    minutes outside New Delhi  where I met these characters who showed me around for the day. The remarkable thing about these girls  and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married. Ten years ago  they certainly would have been married. Now they're not married  and they want to go on to study further  to have a career. They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate  who have never ever done homework. All across the developing world there are millions of parents    tens  hundreds of millions    who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams. And the reason they carry on studying is not because they went to a school like this. This is a private school. This is a fee pay school. This is a good school. This is the best you can get in Hyderabad in Indian education. The reason they went on studying was this. This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called Sugata Mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments  showing that children  in the right conditions  can learn on their own with the help of computers. Those girls have never touched Google. They know nothing about Wikipedia. Imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them. So if you look  as I did  through this tour  and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions  look at the recipes that they come up with for learning  they look nothing like school. What do they look like  Well  education is a global religion. And education  plus technology  is a great source of hope. You can go to places like this. This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo. Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate. Many of them don't have electricity at home. But they find it completely obvious to use computers  websites  make videos  so on and so forth. When you go to places like this what you see is that education in these settings works by pull  not push. Most of our education system is push. I was literally pushed to school. When you get to school  things are pushed at you  knowledge  exams  systems  timetables. If you want to attract people like Juanderson who could  for instance  buy guns  wear jewelry  ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade  and you want to attract him into education  having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense. That isn't really going to attract him. You need to pull him. And so education needs to work by pull  not push. And so the idea of a curriculum is completely irrelevant in a setting like this. You need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings. What does that  Well  the key is motivation  and there are two aspects to it. One is to deliver extrinsic motivation  that education has a payoff. Our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff  but you have to wait quite a long time. That's too long if you're poor. Waiting    years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs  when you've got siblings to look after or a business to help with. So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there and then  often. And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting. So time and again  I found people like this. This is an amazing guy  Sebastiao Rocha  in Belo Horizonte  in the third largest city in Brazil. He's invented more than     games to teach virtually any subject under the sun. In the schools and communities that Taio works in  the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question. Imagine an education system that started from questions  not from knowledge to be imparted  or started from a game  not from a lesson  or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them. Our education systems  you do all that stuff afterward  if you're lucky  sport  drama  music. These things  they teach through. They attract people to learning because it's really a dance project or a circus project or  the best example of all    El Sistema in Venezuela    it's a music project. And so you attract people through that into learning  not adding that on after all the learning has been done and you've eaten your cognitive greens. So El Sistema in Venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning. Taio Rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning. And what you find when you go to these schemes is that they use people and places in incredibly creative ways. Masses of peer learning. How do you get learning to people when there are no teachers  when teachers won't come  when you can't afford them  and even if you do get teachers  what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve  Well  you create your own teachers. You create peer to peer learning  or you create para teachers  or you bring in specialist skills. But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people through technology  people and places that are different. So this is a school in a bus on a building site in Pune  the fastest growing city in Asia. Pune has       building sites. It has        children on those building sites. That's one city. Imagine that urban explosion that's going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites. Well  this is a very simple scheme to get the learning to them through a bus. And they all treat learning  not as some sort of academic  analytical activity  but as that's something that's productive  something you make  something that you can do  perhaps earn a living from. So I met this character  Steven. He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets because his parents had died of AIDS. And he was finally brought back into school  not by the offer of GCSEs  but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter  a practical making skill. So the trendiest schools in the world  High Tech High and others  they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity. Here  there isn't really an option. Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense. And finally  they have a different model of scale  and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale. And I learned it from this guy  who is an amazing character. He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur in education in the world. His name is Madhav Chavan  and he created something called Pratham. And Pratham runs preschool play groups for  now     million children in India. It's the largest NGO in education in the world. And it also supports working class kids going into Indian schools. He's a complete revolutionary. He's actually a trade union organizer by background  and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization. When they got to a certain stage  Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey. McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said   You know what you should do with this  Madhav  You should turn it into McDonald's. And what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise. And it's the same wherever you go. It's reliable and people know exactly where they are. And there will be no mistakes.  And Madhav said   Why do we have to do it that way  Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants   There are Chinese restaurants everywhere  but there is no Chinese restaurant chain. Yet  everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant. They know what to expect  even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different. You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it. These people work with the Chinese restaurant model    same principles  different applications and different settings    not the McDonald's model. The McDonald's model scales. The Chinese restaurant model spreads. So mass education started with social entrepreneurship in the   th century. And that's desperately what we need again on a global scale. And what can we learn from all of that  Well  we can learn a lot because our education systems are failing desperately in many ways. They fail to reach the people they most need to serve. They often hit their target but miss the point. Improvement is increasingly difficult to organize  our faith in these systems  incredibly fraught. And this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation  what kind of different design we need. There are two basic types of innovation. There's sustaining innovation  which will sustain an existing institution or an organization  and disruptive innovation that will break it apart  create some different way of doing it. There are formal settings    schools  colleges  hospitals    in which innovation can take place  and informal settings    communities  families  social networks. Almost all our effort goes in this box  sustaining innovation in formal settings  getting a better version of the essentially Bismarckian school system that developed in the   th century. And as I said  the trouble with this is that  in the developing world there just aren't teachers to make this model work. You'd need millions and millions of teachers in China  India  Nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need. And in our system  we know that simply doing more of this won't eat into deep educational inequalities  especially in inner cities and former industrial areas. So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation. We need more reinvention. And all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves. They're recognizably schools  but they look different. There are Big Picture schools in the U.S. and Australia. There are Kunskapsskolan schools in Sweden. Of    of them  only two of them are in schools. Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools. There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland called Jaringan. And they all have the same kind of features  highly collaborative  very personalized  often pervasive technology  learning that starts from questions and problems and projects  not from knowledge and curriculum. So we certainly need more of that. But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school  they're in family and community  what you also need  definitely  is more on the right hand side. You need efforts to supplement schools. The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy  the family based learning system to support and encourage people in schools. The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone  which over    years  led by Geoffrey Canada  has  through a mixture of schooling and family and community projects  attempted to transform not just education in schools  but the entire culture and aspiration of about        families in Harlem. We need more of that completely new and radical thinking. You can go to places an hour away  less  from this room  just down the road  which need that  which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. And finally  you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways. So we are on the verge        of an amazing achievement  the schoolification of the world. Every child up to the age of    who wants a place in school will be able to have one in     . It's an amazing thing. But it is  unlike cars  which have developed so rapidly and orderly  actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the   th century  from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers  and often by religious missionaries  taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion  and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed. It's recognizably   th century in its roots. And of course it's a huge achievement. And of course it will bring great things. It will bring skills and learning and reading. But it will also lay waste to imagination. It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence. It will stratify society as much as it liberates it. And we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform. That is why we need really radical thinking  and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn. Thank you.  Applause  When I was    years old  a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school. And as a special treat  he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands. And there it was  the seat of human consciousness  the powerhouse of the human body  sitting in my hands. And that day I knew that when I grew up  I was going to become a brain doctor  scientist  something or the other. Years later  when I finally grew up  my dream came true. And it was while I was doing my Ph.D. on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I'd like to share with you all today. It is estimated that one in six children  that's one in six children  suffer from some developmental disorder. This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments. Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder. But here's what really perplexed me. Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain  most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior. But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms  without even doing an ECG or a chest X ray to look at the heart. It seemed so intuitive to me. To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately  it would be necessary to look at the brain directly. Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete  or even a misleading  picture of the child's problems. Yet  despite all the advances in medical technology  the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited. And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it  instead of in brain research  towards diagnosing brain disorders in children. Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG  or the electrical activity of the brain  in real time  allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions  vision  attention  language  audition. A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain. And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant  allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms. And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team  and we're finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders. And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in India. I'd like to tell you about one such child  whose story was also covered by ABC News. Seven year old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism. Like many autistic children  his mind was locked inside his body. There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time. And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially  and he would probably never have too much language. When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin's brain  the results were startling. It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic. He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye  but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism. After Justin was given anti seizure medication  the change in him was amazing. Within a period of    days  his vocabulary went from two to three words to     words. And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ. Research shows that    percent of children  almost    percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures. These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin. All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism  attention deficit disorder  mental retardation  language problems. Instead  our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn't possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments. So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment. For too long now  children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen. And for too long  these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation. But we are now in a new era of neuroscience  one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects  non invasively  and find the true source of so many disabilities in children. So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder  then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved. One more mind will be unlocked. And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there's still time for his or her brain to recover. And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. Thank you. So  these are the Dark Ages. And the Dark Ages are the time between when you put away the Lego for the last time as a kid  and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy. Started out with my then four year old   Oh  should buy the kid some Lego. That stuff's cool.  Walked into the Lego store. Bought him this. It's totally appropriate for a four year old. I think the box says    let's see here       to     on it. I turn to my wife and said   Who are we buying this for   She's like   Oh  us.  I'm like   Okay. All right. That's cool.  Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control. The dining room looked like this. You walk there  and it hurts. So we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex. Torture  very funny. Wow  you guys are great. And we put down those little floor tiles  and then I went onto eBay and bought     pounds of Lego    which is insane. My daughter    the day we got it  I was tucking her in    and I said   Honey  you're my treasure.  And she said   No  the Lego is the treasure.  And then she said   Dad  we're Lego rich.  I was like   Yeah. I suppose we are.  So then once you do that you're like   Oh  crap. Where am I going to put all this   So you go to The Container Store and spend an enormous amount of money  and then you start this crazy sorting process that never    it's just nuts. Whatever. So then you realize there are these conventions. And you go to one of these conventions  and some dude built the Titanic. And you're like   Holy shit  He had to come in like a truck  a semi  with this thing.  And then someone built this    this is the Smith Tower in Seattle. Just beautiful. And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for Lego  because Lego    the Danish    no  they're not into guns. But the Americans  Oh  we'll make some guns for Lego  no problem. And at a certain point  you look around  you're like   Whoa  this is a really nerdy crowd.  And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd  but that's like a couple of levels above furries. The nerds here  they get laid    except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket    and you say to yourself at some point   Am I part of this group  Like  am I into this   And I was just like   Yeah  I guess I am. I'm coming out. I'm kind of into this stuff  and I'm going to stop being embarrassed.  So then you really get into it  and you're like   Well  the Lego people in Denmark  they've got all this software to let you build your own virtually.  And so this is like this CAD program where you build it. And then whatever you design virtually  you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later. And then some of the designs that people do they actually sell in the store. The Lego guys don't give you any royalties  strangely  but some user made this and then it sold. And it's pretty amazing actually. Then you notice that if that Lego provided CAD program isn't enough  there's an entire open source  third party  independent Lego CAD program that lets you do  D modeling and  D rendering and make  in fact  movies out of Lego   D films of which there are thousands on YouTube  and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content    just beautiful    and people recreating all sorts of things. I have to take a moment. I love the guy who's like running away with his clasps  his hooks. Okay. Anyway. There's a whole programming language and robotics tool  so if you want to teach someone how to program  kid  adult  whatever it is. And the guy that made this  he made a slot machine out of Lego. And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine  I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego. The insides were Lego. There's people getting drunk building Lego  and you've got to finish the thing before you puke. There's a whole gray market for Lego  thousands of home based businesses. And some people will fund their entire Lego habit by selling the little guy  but then you have no guys in your ships. And then  just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture. This is amazing what you can do. And don't kid yourself  some architectural details  incredible organic shapes and just  even  nature out of  again  little blocks. This is my house. And this is my house. I was afraid a car was going to come smash it as I was taking a picture for you guys. Anyway  I'm out of time. But just very quickly    we'll just see if I can do this quick. Because there aren't enough TED logos around here. Let's see here. Okay. Ta da. The story starts in Kenya in December of       when there was a disputed presidential election  and in the immediate aftermath of that election  there was an outbreak of ethnic violence. And there was a lawyer in Nairobi  Ory Okolloh    who some of you may know from her TEDTalk    who began blogging about it on her site  Kenyan Pundit. And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence  the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout. And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was. And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on. The comments began pouring in  and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them. And she quickly said   It's too much. I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up. There is more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage. If only there was a way to automate this.  And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said   We could do that   and in    hours  they launched Ushahidi. Ushahidi    the name means  witness  or  testimony  in Swahili    is a very simple way of taking reports from the field  whether it's from the web or  critically  via mobile phones and SMS  aggregating it and putting it on a map. That's all it is  but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population    everybody knows where the violence is  but no one person knows what everyone knows    and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it  and it maps it and it makes it public. And that  that maneuver called  crisis mapping   was kicked off in Kenya in January of     . And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform. It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud. It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup. And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page  you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide  all right  This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of      to a global deployment in less than three years. Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology. What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity. And the interesting moment now  the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true. That is the resource that I'm talking about. I call it cognitive surplus. And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large  sometimes global  projects. Cognitive surplus is made up of two things. The first  obviously  is the world's free time and talents. The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects. Now  that free time existed in the   th century  but we didn't get Ushahidi in the   th century. That's the second half of cognitive surplus. The media landscape in the   th century was very good at helping people consume  and we got  as a result  very good at consuming. But now that we've been given media tools    the Internet  mobile phones    that let us do more than consume  what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be. We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us. We still like to consume  of course. But it turns out we also like to create  and we like to share. And it's those two things together    ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large scale efforts    that are the new design resource. And using cognitive surplus  we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific  literary  artistic  political efforts. Designing. We're also getting  of course  a lot of LOLcats. LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions. And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now. This is one of the participatory    one of the participatory models we see coming out of that  along with Ushahidi. Now I want to stipulate  as the lawyers say  that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act. There are other candidates of course  but LOLcats will do as a general case. But here's the thing  The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. Someone who has done something like this  however mediocre and throwaway  has tried something  has put something forward in public. And once they've done it  they can do it again  and they could work on getting it better. There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work  and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows  it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of. The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing. And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap. Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats  right  to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff. But media abundance never works that way. Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything. Even with the sacred printing press  we got erotic novels     years before we got scientific journals. So before I talk about what is  I think  the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi  I want to talk about their shared source. And that source is design for generosity. It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around  social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us  how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them  or because we're being paid to do them. This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini  who set out to test  at the beginning of this decade  what they called  deterrence theory.  And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior  If you want somebody to do less of something  add a punishment and they'll do less of it. Simple  straightforward  commonsensical    also  largely untested. And so they went and studied    daycare centers in Haifa  Israel. They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension  which is pick up time. At pick up time the teachers  who have been with your children all day  would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back. Meanwhile  the parents    perhaps a little busy at work  running late  running errands    want a little slack to pick the kids up late. So Gneezy and Rustichini said   How many instances of late pick ups are there at these    daycare centers   Now they saw    and this is what the graph is  these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals    that there were between six and    instances of late pick ups on average in these    daycare centers. So they divided the daycare centers into two groups. The white group there is the control group  they change nothing. But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line  they said   We are changing this bargain as of right now. If you pick your kid up more than    minutes late  we're going to add a    shekel fine to your bill. Boom. No ifs  ands or buts.  And the minute they did that  the behavior in those daycare centers changed. Late pick ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre fine average  and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre fine average for the life of the fine. And you can see immediately what happened  right  The fine broke the culture of the daycare center. By adding a fine  what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of    shekels  and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers. And so the parents  quite sensibly  said      shekels to pick my kid up late  What could be bad   The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the   th century was that we are all rational  self maximizing actors  and in that explanation    the daycare center had no contract    should have been operating without any constraints. But that's not right. They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones. And critically  the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did. So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks    run the fine for a dozen weeks    and then they say   Okay  that's it. All done  fine.  And then a really interesting thing happens  Nothing changes. The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed. Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible  that incompatibility can persist over long periods. So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain    as with the parents paying the teachers    and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain  when you're really designing for generosity. This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi. This is  I think  the range that matters. Both of these rely on cognitive surplus. Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share. Here is the critical difference between these  LOLcats is communal value. It's value created by the participants for each other. Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere    every time you see a large aggregate of shared  publicly available data  whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever. This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy  maybe a little more even  but this is also a largely solved problem. I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying   Where  oh where  can I find a picture of a cute cat   Ushahidi  by contrast  is civic value. It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole. The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants  but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating. And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation. It really is going to be a side effect of what we  collectively  make of these kinds of efforts. There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs. That will be true year in and year out. The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow  and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead    a very different model than our default model for large scale group action in the   th century. What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said  the inventor and entrepreneur. Kamen said   Free cultures get what they celebrate.  We've got a choice before us. We've got this trillion hours a year. We can use it to crack each other up  and we're going to do that. That  we get for free. But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value. And to the degree we're going to do that  to the degree we're able to do that  we'll be able to change society. Thank you very much. In the last    years  we've been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences. And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next    years is going to be retrofitting suburbia. So whether it's redeveloping dying malls or re inhabiting dead big box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots  I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under performing  especially retail  sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places. And in the process  what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost  and have the infrastructure in place  instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges. So why is this important  I think there are any number of reasons  and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few. Just from the perspective of climate change  the average urban dweller in the U.S. has about one third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller  mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more  and living in detached buildings  you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of. So strictly from a climate change perspective  the cities are already relatively green. The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs. All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs  we have doubled the amount of miles we drive. It's increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency. We're just driving so much more  we haven't been able to keep up technologically. Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting. Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles. And those have been linked then with the rather alarming  growing rates of obesity  shown in these maps here  and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one in three chance of developing diabetes. And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore  again  because of our development patterns. And then there's finally    there's the affordability question. I mean  how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices  Suburban expansion to cheap land  for the last    years    you know the cheap land out on the edge    has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream. But increasingly  the savings promised by drive till you qualify affordability    which is basically our model    those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs. For instance  here in Atlanta  about half of households make between         and         a year  and they are spending    percent of their income on housing and    percent on transportation. I mean  that's      figures. That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon. You know  none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs  and they're not going down any time soon. Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips  there are reasons why it's important to retrofit. But is it practical  I think it is. June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade  and we've found over    varied projects. But that they're really all market driven  and what's driving the market in particular    number one    is major demographic shifts. We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family focused place  but that's really not the case anymore. Since       already two thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them. We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this. The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now  the Baby Boomers retiring    and then there's a gap  Generation X  which is a small generation. They're still having kids    but Generation Y hasn't even started hitting child rearing age. They're the other big generation. So as a result of that  demographers predict that through          to    percent of new households will not have kids in them. And the market research  consumer research  asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like  what they would like to live in  tells us there is going to be a huge demand    and we're already seeing it    for more urban lifestyles within suburbia. That basically  the Boomers want to be able to age in place  and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle  but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia. The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt. Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band  but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots    and suburbia is full of them. When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown  it made sense to just build surface parking lots. But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again  as we've just continued to sprawl  and they now have a relatively central location. It no longer just makes sense. That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots. It now makes sense to go back in  build a deck and build up on those sites. So what do you do with a dead mall  dead office park  It turns out  all sorts of things. In a slow economy like ours  re inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies. So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that's been re inhabited as art space. It's now home to artist studios  theater groups  dance troupes. It's not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was  but it's serving its community. It's keeping the lights on. It's becoming  I think  a really great institution. Other malls have been re inhabited as nursing homes  as universities  and as all variety of office space. We also found a lot of examples of dead big box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well    lots of schools  lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one. This was a little grocery store  a Food Lion grocery store  that is now a public library. In addition to  I think  doing a beautiful adaptive reuse  they tore up some of the parking spaces  put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff  put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods. And they've made this  what was just a store along a commercial strip  into a community gathering space. This one is a little L shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix  Arizona. Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint  a gourmet grocery  and they put up a restaurant in the old post office. Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination. It's been so successful  they've now taken over the strip across the street. The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim   Walking distance to Le Grande Orange   because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call  a third place.  If home is the first place and work is the second place  the third place is where you go to hang out and build community. And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family  the family households  there's a real hunger for more third places. So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category  the next strategy  redevelopment. Now  during the boom  there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density  a sort of compact  walkable urban neighborhoods. But some of them have been much more incremental. This is Mashpee Commons  the oldest retrofit that we've found. And it's just incrementally  over the last    years  built urbanism on top of its parking lots. So the black and white photo shows the simple   's strip shopping center. And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact  mixed use New England village  and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side. So  you know  sometimes it's incremental. Sometimes  it's all at once. This is another infill project on the parking lots  this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C. When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site  the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street  several apartments and condo buildings  while keeping the existing office buildings. Here is the site in       It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville. By       it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right. Today  the transit  the Main Street and the new housing have all been built. Eventually  I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall. Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped. Transit is a big driver of retrofits. So here's what it looks like. You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street. This one is one of my favorites  Belmar. I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all green construction. There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines. This was a very large mall on a hundred acre superblock. It's now    walkable urban blocks with public streets  two public parks  eight bus lines and a range of housing types  and so it's really given Lakewood  Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had. Here was the mall in its heyday. They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall. So here's the site in      with the mall. By       the mall has died. The department store has been kept    and we found this was true in many cases. The department stores are multistory  they're better built. They're easy to be re adapted. But the one story stuff ... that's really history. So here it is at projected build out. This project  I think  has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods. It's providing       households with the option of a more urban lifestyle. It's about two thirds built out right now. Here's what the new Main Street looks like. It's very successful  and it's helped to prompt    eight of the    regional malls in Denver have now  or have announced plans to be  retrofitted. But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring    just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city. No  it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties. And so it's giving people more choices  but it's not taking away choices. But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability. You want to also try to get more systemic transformation. We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves. So this is one that has been retrofitted in California. They took the commercial strip shown on the black and white images below  and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town. And it's transformed from being an ugly  unsafe  undesirable address  to becoming a beautiful  attractive  dignified sort of good address. I mean now we're hoping we start to see it  they've already built City Hall  attracted two hotels. I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree. So there's a lot of great things  but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting. But densification is not going to work everywhere. Sometimes re greening is really the better answer. There's a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint  Michigan. There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement    sort of victory gardens meets the Internet. But perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology  as in this example outside of Minneapolis. When the shopping center died  the city restored the site's original wetlands  creating lakefront property  which then attracted private investment  the first private investment to this very low income neighborhood in over    years. So they've managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time. This is another re greening example. It also makes sense in very strong markets. This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop. And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit. The creek had been culverted under the parking lot. But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat. So I've shown you some of the first generation of retrofits. What's next  I think we have three challenges for the future. The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale. We need to be able to target which areas really should be re greened. Where should we be redeveloping  And where should we be encouraging re inhabitation  These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta. I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta     years from now. And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves    expensive  but simple. One  in a hundred years  transit on all major rail and road corridors. Two  in a hundred years  thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors. It's a little extreme  but we've got a little water problem. In a hundred years  subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won't be viable. And so we've created the eco acre transfer to transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production. So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits. And I close with this image of democracy in action  This is a protest that's happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring  Maryland on an Astroturf town green. Now  retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism  and not without reason  you don't get much more phony than an Astroturf town green. I have to say  these are very hybrid places. They are new but trying to look old. They have urban streetscapes  but suburban parking ratios. Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia  but they're less diverse than cities. And they are public places  but that are managed by private companies. And just the surface appearance are often    like the Astroturf here    they make me wince. So  you know  I mean I'm glad that the urbanism is doing its job. The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks  the streets and blocks  the putting in of public space  compromised as it may be  is still a really great thing. But we've got to get the architecture better. The final challenge is for all of you. I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places    more sustainable places  period. But culturally  we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic  and we expect that. But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to. It's time to let them grow up  so I want you to all support the zoning changes  the road diets  the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Thank you. It can be a very complicated thing  the ocean. And it can be a very complicated thing  what human health is. And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task  but what I'm going to try to say is that even in that complexity  there's some simple themes that I think  if we understand  we can really move forward. And those simple themes aren't really themes about the complex science of what's going on  but things that we all pretty well know. And I'm going to start with this one  If momma ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. We know that  right  We've experienced that. And if we just take that and we build from there  then we can go to the next step  which is that if the ocean ain't happy  ain't nobody happy. That's the theme of my talk. And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways. This is a shot of Cannery Row in     . Cannery Row  at the time  had the biggest industrial canning operation on the west coast. We piled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water. Rolf Bolin  who was a professor at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work  wrote in the     s that  The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay were so bad they turned lead based paints black.  People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell  but you know what they came out saying  They say   You know what you smell  You smell money.  That pollution was money to that community  and those people dealt with the pollution and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money. We made the ocean unhappy  we made people very unhappy  and we made them unhealthy. The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages  and I want to call that  pinch a minnow  hurt a whale.  The pyramid of ocean life ... Now  when an ecologist looks at the ocean    I have to tell you    we look at the ocean in a very different way  and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ecologist looks at the ocean  we see all those interconnections. We see the base of the food chain  the plankton  the small things  and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid  and on so up this diagram. And that flow  that flow of life  from the very base up to the very top  is the flow that ecologists see. And that's what we're trying to preserve when we say   Save the ocean. Heal the ocean.  It's that pyramid. Now why does that matter for human health  Because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there  some very frightening things happen. Pollutants  some pollutants have been created by us  molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies. And they go in the base of that pyramid  and they drift up  they're passed up that way  on to predators and on to the top predators  and in so doing  they accumulate. Now  to bring that home  I thought I'd invent a little game. We don't really have to play it  we can just think about it here. It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game. Imagine that when we got on this boat  we were all given two Styrofoam peanuts. Can't do much with them  Put them in your pocket. Suppose the rules are  every time you offer somebody a drink  you give them the drink  and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too. What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here  and they will accumulate in the drunkest  stingiest people. There's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts. And that's exactly what happens with PDBs in this food pyramid  They accumulate into the top of it. Now suppose  instead of Styrofoam peanuts  we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead. Well  some of us would be eating those chocolates instead of passing them around  and instead of accumulating  they will just pass into our group here and not accumulate in any one group because they're absorbed by us. And that's the difference between a PCB and  say  something natural like an omega    something we want out of the marine food chain. PCBs accumulate. We have great examples of that  unfortunately. PCBs accumulate in dolphins in Sarasota Bay  in Texas  in North Carolina. They get into the food chain. The dolphins eat the fish that have PCBs from the plankton  and those PCBs  being fat soluble  accumulate in these dolphins. Now  a dolphin  mother dolphin  any dolphin    there's only one way that a PCB can get out of a dolphin. And what's that  In mother's milk. Here's a diagram of the PCB load of dolphins in Sarasota Bay. Adult males  a huge load. Juveniles  a huge load. Females after their first calf is already weaned  a lower load. Those females  they're not trying to. Those females are passing the PCBs in the fat of their own mother's milk into their offspring  and their offspring don't survive. The death rate in these dolphins  for the first calf born of every female dolphin  is    to    percent. These mothers pump their first offspring full of this pollutant  and most of them die. Now  the mother then can go and reproduce  but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals    the death of the first born calf. There's another top predator in the ocean  it turns out. That top predator  of course  is us. And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places. This is whale meat that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo    or is it  In fact  what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were. And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat. Some of them were illegal whale meat  by the way. That's another story. But some of them were not whale meat at all. Even though they were labeled whale meat  they were dolphin meat. Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber. And those dolphin parts had a huge load of PCBs  dioxins and heavy metals. And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat. It turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world. That's a tragedy for those populations  but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat. We had these data a few years ago. I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dolphin meat  and it was toxic. It had two to three to     times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA. And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking   Well  I know this. This is a great scientific discovery   but it was so awful. And for the very first time in my scientific career  I broke scientific protocol  which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals and then begin to talk about them. We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation  not for us  but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding  who may have young children  would be buying something that they thought was healthy  but it was really toxic. That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan  and I'm really proud to say that at this point  it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan that's labeled incorrectly  even though they're still selling whale meat  which I believe they shouldn't. But at least it's labeled correctly  and you're no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead. It isn't just there that this happens  but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arctic and in the United States and in the European arctic  a natural diet of seals and whales leads to an accumulation of PCBs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women. These women have toxic breast milk. They cannot feed their offspring  their children  their breast milk because of the accumulation of these toxins in their food chain  in their part of the world's ocean pyramid. That means their immune systems are compromised. It means that their children's development can be compromised. And the world's attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women  not by changing the pyramid  but by changing what they particularly eat out of it. We've taken them out of their natural pyramid in order to solve this problem. That's a good thing for this particular acute problem  but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem. There's other ways of breaking the pyramid. The pyramid  if we jam things in the bottom  can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged. And if we jam nutrients  sewage  fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid  it can back up all through it. We end up with things we've heard about before  red tides  for example  which are blooms of toxic algae floating through the oceans causing neurological damage. We can also see blooms of bacteria  blooms of viruses in the ocean. These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the genus vibrio  which includes the genus that has cholera in it. How many people have seen a  beach closed  sign  Why does that happen  It happens because we have jammed so much into the base of the natural ocean pyramid that these bacteria clog it up and overfill onto our beaches. Often what jams us up is sewage. Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying   Closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can't use it   Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that. We wouldn't tolerate our parks being swamped by human sewage  but beaches are closed a lot in our country. They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason  and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either. It's not just a question of cleanliness  it's also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease. These vibrios  these bacteria  can actually infect people. They can go into your skin and create skin infections. This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative  showing the rise of the infections by vibrio in people over the last few years. Surfers  for example  know this incredibly. And if you can see on some surfing sites  in fact  not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather's like  but on some surf rider sites  you see a little flashing poo alert. That means that the beach might have great waves  but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be because they can carry with them  even after a great day of surfing  this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve. Some of these infections are actually carrying antibiotic resistance genes now  and that makes them even more difficult. These same infections create harmful algal blooms. Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals. This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons that come out of these harmful algal blooms  shellfish poisoning fish ciguatera  diarrheic shellfish poisoning    you don't want to know about that    neurotoxic shellfish poisoning  paralytic shellfish poisoning. These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blooms. Rita Calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities  brought there  not by a normal human vector  but by a marine vector  this copepod. Copepods are small crustaceans. They're a tiny fraction of an inch long  and they can carry on their little legs some of the cholera bacteria that then leads to human disease. That has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn't move these vectors of cholera around the world. So what do you do  We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow that the pyramid may not be working so well  that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clogged. What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow  Well  there's a bunch of things you could do. You could call Joe the Plumber  for example. And he could come in and fix the flow. But in fact  if you look around the world  not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems  there have been places where problems have been fixed  where people have come to grips with these issues and begun to turn them around. Monterey is one of those. I started out showing how much we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems. In       that's the picture. In       the picture is dramatically different. The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated. But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems. They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top. And that pyramid in Monterey  right now  because of the efforts of a lot of different people  is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last     years. It didn't happen accidentally. It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this. On the left there  Julia Platt  the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove. At    years old  became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean. In       she produced California's first community based marine protected area  right next to the biggest polluting cannery  because Julia knew that when the canneries eventually were gone  the ocean needed a place to grow from  that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed  and she wanted to provide that seed. Other people  like David Packard and Julie Packard  who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium to lock into people's notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean ecosystem were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the ecosystem would be. That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift  not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay  but other places around the world. Well  I want to leave you with the thought that what we're really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid  and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life. It's an ocean planet  and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species  but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected. And it's only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves. Thank you very much.
