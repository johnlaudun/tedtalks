I hope you'll understand my English. In the mornings it is terrible  and the afternoon is worst. During many years  I made some speeches starting with this saying   City is not a problem  it's a solution.  And more and more  I'm convinced that it's not only a solution for a country  but it's a solution for the problem of climate change. But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities. I'm working in cities for almost    years  and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big  or the other mayors say   We don't have financial resources   I would like to say from the experience I had  every city in the world can be improved in less than three years. There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale  it's not a question of financial resources. Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co responsibility and also a design. So to start  I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers. The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together. And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura  and can we imagine  if we cut the casque of the turtle  how sad she's going to be  And that's what we're doing in our cities  living here  working here  having leisure here. And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city. So  the other character is Otto  the automobile. He is invited for a party    he never wants to leave. The chairs are on the tables and still drinking  and he drinks a lot.  Laughter  And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical  he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure. Freeways. He's a very demanding person. And on the other hand  Accordion  the friendly bus  he carries     people        in Sweden      Brazilians.  Laughter  Speaking about the design  every city has its own design. Curitiba  my city  three million in the metropolitan area            people in the city itself. Curitiba  Rio  it's like two birds kissing themselves. Oaxaca  San Francisco    it's very easy  Market Street  Van Ness and the waterfront. And every city has its own design. But to make it happen  sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design    an idea that everyone  or the large majority  will help you to make it happen. And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. And it's an example of living and working together. And this is where we have more density  it's where we have more public transport. So  this system started in '  . We started with        passengers a day  now it's           passengers a day. And it took    years until another city ... which is Bogota  and they did a very good job. And now there's    cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba. And one thing  it's important not for only your own city  every city  besides its normal problems  they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity. That means mostly two main issues    mobility and sustainability    are becoming very important for the cities. And this is an articulated bus  double articulated. And we are very close to my house. You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there. And that's the evolution of the system. What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes  the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway. That's why  I'm trying to say  it's like metro nizing the bus. This is the design of the bus  and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding. And for handicapped  they can use this as a normal system. What I'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars    more than    percent    so when we depend only on cars  it's ...    that's why when we're talking about sustainability  it's not enough  green buildings. It's not enough  a new materials. It's not enough  new sources of energy. It's the concept of the city  the design of the city  that's also important  too. And also  how to teach the children. I'll speak on this later on. Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems. We started in '    proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus. The subway was against  of course. And    years after  they called us to develop    we're developing this idea. And you can understand how different it's going to be  the image of Rio with the system    one minute frequency. And it's not Shanghai  it's not being colored during the day  only at night it will look this way. And before you say it's a Norman Foster design  we designed this in '  . And this is the model  how it's going to work. So  it's the same system  the vehicle is different. And that's the model. What I'm trying to say is  I'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better. I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems  and with one condition  never    if you have a subway  if you have surface systems  if you have any kind of system    never compete in the same space. And coming back to the car  I always used to say that the car is like your mother in law  you have to have good relationship with her  but she cannot command your life. So  when the only woman in your life is your mother in law  you have a problem.  Laughter  So  all the ideas about how to transform through design    old quarries and open universities and botanic garden    all of it's related to how we teach the children. And the children  we teach during six months how to separate their garbage. And after  the children teach their parents. And now we have    percent    since    years  it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world. Seven zero. So teach the children. I would like to say  if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said  but don't forget the cities and the children. I'm working in a museum and also a multi use city  because you cannot have empty places during    hours a day. You should have always a structure of living and working together. Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the    hours. Another issue is  a city's like our family portrait. We don't rip our family portrait  even if we don't like the nose of our uncle  because this portrait is you. And these are the references that we have in any city. This is the main pedestrian mall  we did it in    hours. Yes  you have to be fast. And these are the references from our ethnic contribution. This is the Italian portal  the Ukrainian park  the Polish park  the Japanese square  the German park. All of a sudden  the Soviet Union  they split. And since we have people from Uzbekistan  Kazakhstan  Tajikistan   unclear   we have to stop the program. Don't forget  creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget. If you cut two zeros  it's much better. And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months. Parks    old quarries that they were transformed into parks. Quarries once made the nature  and sometimes we took this and we transformed. And every part can be transformed  every frog can be transformed in a prince. So  in a city  you have to work fast. Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture. That means me  with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning. And this is an acupuncture note    or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones can make the city better. The smallest park in New York  the most beautiful     meters. So  I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials    new sustainable materials    but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end  because we don't have the whole time to plan. And I think creativity  innovation is starting. And we cannot have all the answers. So when you start    and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers    it's important starting and having the contribution from people  and they could teach you if you're not in the right track. At the end  I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song. OK  Please  allow me just two minutes. You're going to make the music and the rhythm.   Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      Toonchi too  Toonchi too  Toonchi too      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it  You can do it      Use less your car  Make this decision      Avoid carbon emission  It's possible  It's possible      You can do it  You can do it      Live closer to work      Work closer to home  Save energy in your home      It's possible  It's possible  You can do it      You can do it  Separate your garbage      Organic  schmorganic  Save more  Waste less  It's possible      You can do it  Please  do it now    Thank you. I draw to better understand things. Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing. Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for  The Way Things Work   while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding  spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner. Who knew about extension managers  I've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions  but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out  because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector  so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would. Now  I could talk about something that I'm known for  something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here  or I could talk about something I really care about. I decided to go with the latter. I'm going to talk about Rome. Now  why would I care about Rome  particularly  Well  I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the '  s to study architecture. I was lucky enough to spend my last year  my fifth year  in Rome as a student. It changed my life. Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home  driving into RISD everyday  driving back. I missed the '  s. I read about them   Laughter  I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them  but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome  and it's a place that is never far from my mind. So  whenever given an opportunity  I try to do something in it or with it or for it. I also make drawings to help people understand things. Things that I want them to believe I understand. And that's what I do as an illustrator  that's my job. So  I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome. I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years. These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible    I need to. All different materials  all different styles  all different times  drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome. Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it. These are sketches of some of the little details. Rome is a city full of surprises. I mean  we're talking about unusual perspectives  we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast  sun drenched piazzas    never  though  piazzas that are not humanly scaled. Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically. That amazing juxtaposition of old and new  the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue    especially in the summer    compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets. And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form. How could I share my sense of Rome  my understanding of Rome  And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends  basically. The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going  you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency. Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning  maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome. And here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page. Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways. Maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this. Maybe I should get away from this map completely  and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air    which happens in so many of the squares in the city    and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits. That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot. But even though I just started this presentation  this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate. Eventually  I realized that I had really no content that I could count on  so I decided to move towards packaging.  Laughter  I mean  it seems to work for a lot of things. So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick. But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome. Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible. Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter  and very slow walking through Rome  you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across. Anyways  I went back to the dirigible notion. Went to Alberto Santos Dumont. Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome. This thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of  but it would be like having a ruler    sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler. Not that you know how long number    actually is  but you would be able to compare number    against the Pantheon with number    against the Baths of Caracalla  and so on and so forth. If you were interested. This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax  she has purchased a dirigible    a small dirigible    she's assembling the structure  Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off. She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city. Over the Spanish Steps we go. A nice way to show that river  that stream sort of pouring down the hill. Unfortunately  just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius  and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression  as you can see  as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius    gets a little too close  nudges it. This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius  which is really no more than a pile of quarters high    thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio  completely ruining the symmetry  but that aside a spectacular place to visit. A spectacular framework  inside of which you see  usually  extraordinary blue sky. Over the Pantheon and the    foot diameter Oculus. She parks her dirigible  lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside. The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around  and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view    looking in the hole  getting a different kind of perspective  moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus. Unfortunately for her  the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon  and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome  which would  from their point of view  naturally be hanging upside down. They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo  that little spiral structure you see there. She continues on her way over Piazza Navona. Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant  is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry. They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori  which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace  which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon  and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning. Anyway  the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff. Unfortunately  when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto  Ajax makes a lunge for it. She's managed to save the prosciutto  but in the process she loses the tablecloth  which you can see flying away in the upper left hand corner. They continue without their tablecloth  looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch. They eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes  ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up. Turns out to be the exterior wall    that part of it that remains    of the Coliseum  so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view. At the end of lunch  they untie the anchor  they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius  which has this lightning rod on top. Unfortunately  that's a problem  they get a little too close  and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes. So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion. Marcello  on the other hand  is sort of a lazy guy  but he's not due at work until about noon. So  the alarm goes off and it's five to    or so. He gets up  leaps onto his scooter  races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace  down the alleys  through the streets that tourists may be wandering through  disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn. That speed with which he is moving  I hope I have suggested in this little image  which  again  can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top  one of which is upside down in this image. So  he keeps on moving  approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street. Waiter catches on  but it's too late. And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter. Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine  but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do. Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric  it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself  or we find it. Right through the Piazza della Rotonda  in front of the Pantheon    again wreaking havoc    and finally getting to work. Marcello  as it turns out  is the driver of the number    bus  and if you've been on the number    bus  you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter. And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left hand corner. He's looking at his table  he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of    years   Laughter  and he wants it to be perfect. He's got candles out  he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses. But he's not happy  something's wrong. The phone rings anyway  he's called to the palazzo. He saunters    he saunters at a good clip  but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen  he's sauntering. Everybody knows Carletto  because he's in entertainment  actually  he's in television. He's actually in television repair  which is why people know him. So they all have his number. He arrives at the palazzo  arrives at the big front door. Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian  who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo  nobody's TVs are working and there's a big soccer game coming up  and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous. He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring  and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building  apartment by apartment  checking every television  checking every connection  hoping to find out what this problem is. He works his way up  finally  the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic. He opens the window of the attic  of course  and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna. He removes it  the problems are solved  everybody in the palazzo is happy. And of course  he also solves his own problem. All he has to do now  with a perfect table  is wait for her to arrive. That was the first attempt  but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome. So I thought  well  I'll just do piazzas  and I'll get inside and underneath and I'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on. And then I thought  that's too complicated. No  I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale  so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space. Now that's one drawing  so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher.  Laughter  You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope. There's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together. Then I thought   Wait a minute  what am I doing   A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information  it's a series of layers. I mean  you always peel one layer off another  we think of them as pages  doing it a certain way. But think of them as layers. I mean  Rome is a place of layers    horizontal layers  vertical layers    and I thought  well just peeling off a page would allow me to    if I got you thinking about it the right way    would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers. The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars  the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down. If I do a foldout page on the left hand side and let you just unfold it  you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue. You can see that in       it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever. Adaptations all get buried under the stucco. I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it. But more importantly  I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks  or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco  which is more often the case. So it becomes slightly three dimensional. I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold    double foldout page    which  if you were like me reading a pop up book as a child  you hopefully stick your head into. You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time. And I've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages. But then I thought  maybe I could be simpler here. Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it. Here's a book completely wide open. OK  if I don't open the book the whole way  if I just open it    degrees  we're looking down the front of the Pantheon  and we're looking sort of at the top  more or less down on the square. And if I turn the book the other way  we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon. No foldouts  no tricks    just a book that isn't open the whole way. That seemed promising. I thought  maybe I'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book. So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth. And I thought  maybe I'm on the right track  but it sort of lost its human quality. So I went back to the notion of story  which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.  Pigeon's Progress  struck me as a catchy title. If it was a homing pigeon  it would be called  Homer's Odyssey.  But it was the journey of the ...  Laughter  I mean  if a title works  use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome. It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church. Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back  the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there's no way this pigeon can get home. So it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live  and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things  and we start with the tall ones and so on. Maybe it has to go back and live with family members  that's not always a good thing  but it does sort of bring pigeons together again. And I thought  that's sort of interesting  but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way. So I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons. He'll go anywhere to get them    dangerous places and whatnot    and they become really friends with this guy  and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that. There's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons. But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story. He's taught them to spell his name  which is Aldo. They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him    he lives in this little garret    and they spell his name and fly around. And he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof  and all the pigeons  a la Red Balloon  are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city. And I forgot to mention this  whenever he lost a pigeon  he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city. In the old Roman custom  the dead were never buried within the walls. And I thought that's a really cheery story. So anyway  I went through ... And again  if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere  I just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction. And sometimes it does focus me enough and I'll even do a title page. So  these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on  which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon    she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome    to someone in the city. And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here. You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way. If you see the red line  you are seeing the trail of the pigeon  if you don't see the red line  you are the pigeon. And it becomes necessary and possible  at this point  to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving. Past the Pyramid of Cestius    these will seem very familiar to you  even if you haven't been to Rome recently    past the gatehouse. This is something that's a little bit unusual. This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do  it takes the scenic route   Laughter  which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages. So  we circle around the Coliseum  past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river. We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese    designed by Michelangelo  built of stone taken from the Coliseum    narrow escape. We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori. This is one of those things I show to my students because it's a complete bastardization    a denial of any rules of perspective. The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable  you've succeeded. But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here  a couple are on Mars and a couple of others in Cremona. But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace  where invariably a soccer game is going on  and we're hit by a soccer ball. Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball. I have all the pieces  there's Santa Maria della Pace  there's a soccer ball  there's a little bit of a bird's wing    nothing's happening  so I had to rethink it. And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace  these books are really flexible  incredibly interactive    just turn it around and look at it the other way. Through the alley  we can see the impact is captured in the red line. And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower    one of the few remaining medieval towers    towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona    which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times  there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers    and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo  stopping just long enough on the    foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch our breath. And then we can swoop inside and around  and because we're flying  we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time  so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page. We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu  it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way. Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about  beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon  Ristorante  sign  and so on. And eventually  we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo  which is our destination. Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic  where somebody is working at the drawing board. He removes the message from the leg of the bird  this is what it says. As we look at the drawing board  we see what he's working on is  in fact  a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken  and the red line extends through all the sights. And if you want the information  so that we complete this cycle of understanding  all you have to do is read these paragraphs. Thank you very much. It's a simple idea about nature. I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days. I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals  and tell you about a tool  a very simple tool that I have found. Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit  it's not a technology. It's very powerful for  I think  changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend. And that tool is very simply  as Chris suggested  looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view. It's not my idea  other people have hit on it  but I've tried to take it to some new places. Let me tell you where I got it. Like a lot of my ideas  like a lot of the tools I use  I found it in the garden  I'm a very devoted gardener. And there was a day about seven years ago  I was planting potatoes  it was the first week of May    this is New England  when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom  they're just white clouds above. I was here  planting my chunks  cutting up potatoes and planting it  and the bees were working on this tree  bumblebees  just making this thing vibrate. And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration  you really can't get hurt    it's not like woodworking    and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation. And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden  working alongside that bumblebee  was  what did I and that bumblebee have in common  How was our role in this garden similar and different  And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common  both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another  and both of us    probably  if I can imagine the bee's point of view    thought we were calling the shots. I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant    I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn  or whatever it was    and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country  brought it  and I was planting it. And that bee  no doubt  assumed that it had decided   I'm going for that apple tree  I'm going for that blossom  I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave.  We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are  that we are sovereign subjects in nature  the bee as well as me. I plant the potatoes  I weed the garden  I domesticate the species. But that day  it occurred to me  what if that grammar is nothing more than a self serving conceit  Because  of course  the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge  but we know better. We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower. And when I say manipulated  I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense  right  I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits    color  scent  flavor  pattern    that has lured that bee in. And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar  and also picking up some powder on its leg  and going off to the next blossom. The bee is not calling the shots. And I realized then  I wasn't either. I had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its    into spreading its genes  giving it a little bit more habitat. And that's when I got the idea  which was   Well  what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us   And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention  not as a human technology  but as a co evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species  mostly edible grasses  had exploited us  figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world. The competition of grasses  right  And suddenly everything looked different. And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience. I had thought always    and in fact  had written this in my first book  this was a book about gardening    that lawns were nature under culture's boot  that they were totalitarian landscapes  and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex. And that's what the lawn was. But then I realized   No  this is exactly what the grasses want us to do. I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns  whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees  who they compete with for sunlight.  And so by getting us to mow the lawn  we keep the trees from coming back  which in New England happens very  very quickly. So I started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called  The Botany of Desire.  And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees    that they like sweetness  that they like this color and not that color  that they like symmetry    what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing  That a certain kind of potato  a certain kind of drug  a sativa indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us. And that  wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world  Now  the test of any idea    I said it was a literary conceit    is what does it get us  And when you're talking about nature  which is really my subject as a writer  how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test  Which is  does it make us better citizens of the biotic community  Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota  rather than its destruction  And I would submit that this idea does this. So  let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way  besides some entertaining insights about human desire. As an intellectual matter  looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly  which is    and this is in the realm of intellectual history    which is that we have this Darwinian revolution     years ago ... Ugh. Mini Me.  Laughter  We have this intellectual  this Darwinian revolution in which  thanks to Darwin  we figured out we are just one species among many  evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others  we are acted upon as well as acting  we are really in the fiber  the fabric of life. But the weird thing is  we have not absorbed this lesson     years later  none of us really believes this. We are still Cartesians    the children of Descartes    who believe that subjectivity  consciousness  sets us apart  that the world is divided into subjects and objects  that there is nature on one side  culture on another. As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view  you realize that the real literary conceit is that    is the idea that nature is opposed to culture  the idea that consciousness is everything    and that's another very important thing it does. Looking at the world from other species' points of view is a cure for the disease of human self importance. You suddenly realize that consciousness    which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature  human consciousness    is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world. And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool. But  you know  there's a comedian who said   Well  who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important  Well  consciousness.  So when you look at the plants  you realize that there are other tools and they're just as interesting. I'll give you two examples  also from the garden  lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites  It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite  defending the lima bean. So what plants have    while we have consciousness  tool making  language  they have biochemistry. And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine. Their complexity  their sophistication  is something to really marvel at  and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project. You know  we went into it thinking         or        human genes and we came out with only       . Just to give you grounds for comparison  rice         genes. So who's the more sophisticated species  Well  we're all equally sophisticated. We've been evolving just as long  just along different paths. So  cure for self importance  way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea. And that's really what I do as a writer  as a storyteller  is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically. Now  the other use of this is practical. And I'm going to take you to a farm right now  because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned  in fact  is that we are all  now  being manipulated by corn. And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today  to me  is the final triumph of corn over good sense.  Laughter   Applause  It is part of corn's scheme for world domination. And you will see  the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us. So it helped me understand industrial agriculture  which of course is a Cartesian system. It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge  and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want. Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. I went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented  and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin. And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm  and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that I've ever come across in    years of writing about nature. And that is this  the farm is called Polyface  which means ... the idea is he's got six different species of animals  as well as some plants  growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement. It's permaculture  those of you who know a little bit about this  such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ... what else does he have  All the six different species    rabbits  actually    are all performing ecological services for one another  such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another. It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance  but I'm going to just give you a close up on one piece of it  and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens  his laying hens. And I'll show you  if you take this approach  what you get  OK  And this is a lot more than growing food  as you'll see  this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero sum notion  the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning  and that for us to get what we want  nature is diminished. So  one day  cattle in a pen. The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing  relatively new  hooked to a car battery  even I could carry a quarter acre paddock  set it up in    minutes. Cows graze one day. They move  OK  They graze everything down  intensive grazing. He waits three days  and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile. The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption    it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards    but it houses     chickens. He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank  turns them down  and     hens come streaming down the gangplank    clucking  gossiping as chickens will    and they make a beeline for the cow patties. And what they're doing is very interesting  they're digging through the cow patties for the maggots  the grubs  the larvae of flies. And the reason he's waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day  those larvae will hatch and he'll have a huge fly problem. But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein. So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs  and in the process they're spreading the manure out. Very useful second ecosystem service. And third  while they're in this paddock they are  of course  defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field. They then move out to the next one  and in the course of just a few weeks  the grass just enters this blaze of growth. And within four or five weeks  he can do it again. He can graze again  he can cut  he can bring in another species  like the lambs  or he can make hay for the winter. Now  I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there. So  it's a very productive system. And what I need to tell you is that on     acres he gets        pounds of beef         pounds of pork         dozen eggs         broilers        turkeys        rabbits    an immense amount of food. You know  you hear   Can organic feed the world   Well  look how much food you can produce on     acres if you do this kind of ... again  give each species what it wants  let it realize its desires  its physiological distinctiveness. Put that in play. But look at it from the point of view of the grass  now. What happens to the grass when you do this  When a ruminant grazes grass  the grass is cut from this height to this height  and it immediately does something very interesting. Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio  and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy. So when they lose a lot of leaf mass  they shed roots  they kind of cauterize them and the roots die. And the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots  decomposing them    the earthworms  the fungi  the bacteria    and the result is new soil. This is how soil is created. It's created from the bottom up. This is how the prairies were built  the relationship between bison and grasses. And what I realized when I understood this    and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is  he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer  he's not a sheep farmer  he's not a cattle rancher  he's a grass farmer  because grass is really the keystone species of such a system    is that  if you think about it  this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads  which is that for us to get what we want  nature is diminished. More for us  less for nature. Here  all this food comes off this farm  and at the end of the season there is actually more soil  more fertility and more biodiversity. It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do. There are a lot of farmers doing this today. This is well beyond organic agriculture  which is still a Cartesian system  more or less. And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species  take account of the soil  that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea    because there is no technology involved here except for those fences  which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time    that we can take the food we need from the Earth and actually heal the Earth in the process. This is a way to reanimate the world  and that's what's so exciting about this perspective. When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones  the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about. Thank you very much. I'm here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done. Here is the old story    we've already heard a little bit about it  biology is war in which only the fiercest survive  businesses and nations succeed only by defeating  destroying and dominating competition  politics is about your side winning at all costs. But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge. It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines  in which cooperation  collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role. And the central  but not all important  role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room. I started thinking about the relationship between communication  media and collective action when I wrote  Smart Mobs   and I found that when I finished the book  I kept thinking about it. In fact  if you look back  human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co evolving for quite a long time. Humans have lived for much  much longer than the approximately        years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits  gathering food. The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive. But at some point  they banded together to hunt bigger game. And we don't know exactly how they did this  although they must have solved some collective action problems  it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups. And again  we have no way of knowing  but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged. More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted. So that raised a social question that I believe must have driven new social forms. Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families  And if so  how did they make arrangements  Again  we can't know  but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved. Of course  with agriculture came the first big civilizations  the first cities built of mud and brick  the first empires. And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks  marks on clay in that time. Not too much longer after that  the alphabet was invented. And this powerful tool was really reserved  for thousands of years  for the elite administrators  Laughter  who kept track of accounts for the empires. And then another communication technology enabled new media  the printing press came along  and within decades  millions of people became literate. And from literate populations  new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge  religion and politics. We saw scientific revolutions  the Protestant Reformation  constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before. Not created by the printing press  but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy. And again  new forms of wealth emerged. Now  commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads. But capitalism  as we know it  is only a few hundred years old  enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies  such as the joint stock ownership company  shared liability insurance  double entry bookkeeping. Now of course  the enabling technologies are based on the Internet  and in the many to many era  every desktop is now a printing press  a broadcasting station  a community or a marketplace. Evolution is speeding up. More recently  that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops  and very  very quickly  we're going to see a significant proportion  if not the majority of the human race  walking around holding  carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today. Now  when I started looking into collective action  the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call  social dilemmas.  And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas. I'm going to talk briefly about two of them  the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons. Now  when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly  he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoner's dilemma  so I'm just going to go over that very  very quickly. If you have more questions about it  ask Kevin Kelly later.  Laughter  The prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war  two players who couldn't trust each other. Let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma. Person with the goods  person with the money  because they can't trust each other  are not going to exchange. Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff  but both lose  of course  because they don't get what they want. If they could only agree  if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game  they could proceed. Twenty years ago  Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question  if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors  how does cooperation exist at all  He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered  much to his surprise  that a very  very simple strategy won    it won the first tournament  and even after everyone knew it won  it won the second tournament    that's known as tit for tat. Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game  and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions. Here's how the game is played  there are two players  they've never played the game before  they will not play the game again  they don't know each other  and they are  in fact  in separate rooms. First player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split                whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split    both players are paid and the game is over    or rejects the split    neither player is paid and the game is over. Now  the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don't know in another room is going to get   . Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students  a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to      . And although they were screened and didn't know about the game and had never played the game before  proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to      . Now  the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered  to their surprise  that slash and burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures    each had radically different ideas of what is fair. Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness  that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions  whether we know that or not. The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons. Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late     s. He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource. He had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it. Now  Elinor Ostrom  a political scientist  in      asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask  which is  is it really true that humans will always despoil commons  So she went out and looked at what data she could find. She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds  forestry resources  fisheries  and discovered that yes  in case after case  humans destroyed the commons that they depended on. But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma  in fact  the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma. And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be. They escape by creating institutions for collective action. And she discovered  I think most interestingly  that among those institutions that worked  there were a number of common design principles  and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don't work. I'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines. In biology  the notions of symbiosis  group selection  evolutionary psychology are contested  to be sure. But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology  from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology. And again  our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned. Rational self interest is not always the dominating factor. In fact  people will act to punish cheaters  even at a cost to themselves. And most recently  neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain. Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together. Now  I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms. Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent  socialism emerged as a reaction to that. And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging. Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source  pointing to a new form of production  peer to peer production. I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past  new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth  we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones. Very briefly  let's look at some businesses. IBM  as you know  HP  Sun    some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing their software  are providing portfolios of patents for the commons. Eli Lilly    in  again  the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world    has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems. Toyota  instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace  treats them as a network and trains them to produce better  even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors. Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism  they're doing it because they're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self interest. Open source production has shown us that world class software  like Linux and Mozilla  can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them. Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense. Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface to        developers  countless Amazon shops. They're enriching others  not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves. eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game. Instead of   Neither of us can trust each other  so we have to make suboptimal moves   it's   You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate.  Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in     languages in just a couple of years. We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world  including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now  it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it  illiterates can be trained to use it. BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader  making the system more efficient the more it is used. Millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they're not using them to link together through the Internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers    that's Folding home at Stanford    to crack codes  to search for life in outer space. I don't think we know enough yet. I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are  but I think we can begin to think about them. And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them  but think about self interest. This is all about self interest that adds up to more. In El Salvador  both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy. In the U.S.  in the Philippines  in Kenya  around the world  citizens have self organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS. Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible  A transdisciplinary study of cooperation  I believe that the payoff would be very big. I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines. And I am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people    and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things    but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago  people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits. Descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking. When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease  suffering was alleviated. What forms of suffering could be alleviated  what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation  I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen  it's going to require effort. So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started. Thank you. Thank you. Ooh  I'm like   Phew  phew  calm down. Get back into my body now.   Laughter  Usually when I play out  the first thing that happens is people scream out   What's she doing    I'll play at these rock shows  be on stage standing completely still  and they're like   What's she doing   What's she doing    And then I'll kind of be like     Vvvwow      and then they're like   Whoa   I'm sure you're trying to figure out   Well  how does this thing work   Well  what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand. See  the closer I get to this antenna  the higher the note gets    and you can get it really low. And with this hand I'm controlling the volume  so the further away my right hand gets  the louder it gets. So basically  with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes  when really it's continuously going ... Sometimes I startle myself  I'll forget that I have it on  and I'll lean over to pick up something  and then it goes like     Blip      Oh   And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don't turn the thing off. Maybe we'll go into the next tune  because I totally lost where this is going. We're going to do a song by David Mash called  Listen  the Words Are Gone   and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax. So  I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked  there are so many. And ... Well  I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin. It was invented around the     s  and the inventor  L on Theremin    he also was a musician besides an inventor    he came up with the idea for making the theremin  I think  when he was working on some shortwave radios. And there'd be that sound in the signal    it's like  Screeching     and he thought   Oh  what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument  because there are pitches in it.  And so somehow through developing that  he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now. And a lot of times  even kids nowadays  they'll make reference to a theremin by going   Whoo hoo hoo hoo   because in the '  s it was used in the sci fi horror movies  that sound that's like ...  Woo hoo hoo hoo  It's kind of a funny  goofy sound to do. And sometimes if I have too much coffee  then my vibrato gets out of hand. You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing. You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control. It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on    what Michael was doing    because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune  and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time  you want to be feeling the music. And then also  you're trying to stay very  very  very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch  or sometimes if you're holding a low note     Tone rising out of key     and breathing will make it ... If I pass out on the next song ... I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing  or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing  you don't want to have any sudden movements. And if I go to a club and play a gig  people are like   Here  have some drinks on us   And it's like   Well  I'm about to go on soon  I don't want to be like     Teetering tones     you know   It really does reflect the mood that you're in also  if you're ... it's similar to being a vocalist  except instead of it coming out of your throat  you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference  you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly. You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it  adjust it  and just move on  or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me. I think we will play another tune now. I'm going to do  Lush Life.  It's one of my favorite tunes to play. I'm a historian. Steve told us about the future of little technology  I'm going to show you some of the past of big technology. This was a project to build a       ton nuclear bomb propelled spaceship and go to Saturn and Jupiter. This took place in my childhood         . It was deeply classified. I'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified  but has now been reclassified. If all goes well  next year I'll be back  and I'll have a lot more to show you  and if all doesn't go well  I'll be in jail  like Wen Ho Lee. So  this ship was basically the size of the Marriott Hotel  a little taller and a little bigger. And one of the people who worked on it at the beginning was my father  Freeman  there in the middle. That's me and my sister  Esther  who's a frequent TEDster. I didn't like nuclear bomb propelled spaceships. I mean  I thought it was a great idea  but I started building kayaks. So we had a few kayaks. Just so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove. But all the time I was out there doing these strange kayak voyages in odd  beautiful parts of this planet  I always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion  and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships. They were actually going to go    Ted Taylor  who led the project  was going to take his children. My father was not going to take his children  that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years. The project began in '   at General Atomics there  that's right on the coast at La Jolla. Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture. That's the     foot diameter library. That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship. So put that library at the bottom of that ship    that's how big the thing was going to be. It would take two or three thousand bombs. The people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work. It was the first project funded by ARPA. That's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars to get this thing started.  Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson.  That's July '  . Two days later  the space traveler's manifesto explaining why    just like we heard yesterday    why we need to go into space   ... trips to satellites of the outer planets. August         .  These are the statistics of what would be the good places to go and stop. Some of the sizes of the ships  ranging all the way up to ship mass of   million tons. So that was the outer extreme. Here was version two        bombs. These are five kiloton yield bombs  about the size of small Volkswagens  it would take     to get into orbit. Here we see a        ton ship will deliver       tons to Saturn and back    essentially  a five year trip. Possible departure dates  October      to February     . These are trajectories going to Mars. All this was done by hand  with slide rules. The little Orion ship  and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals  you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building. NASA had no interest  they tried to kill the project. The people who supported it were the Air Force  which meant that it was all secret. And that's why when you get something declassified  that's what it looks like. Military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet. There's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union. This is the really secret stuff  how to get directed energy explosions. So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion    not like just a stick of dynamite  but you're directing it at the ship. And this is still a very active subject. It's quite dangerous  but I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you're going to keep them secret. This is what happened at     microseconds. The Air Force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this. The guys in La Jolla said   We've got to get started now.  They built a high explosive propelled model. These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't  and kept it in their basement for the last    years. So  these are three pound charges of C   that's about    times what the guy had in his shoes. This is Ed Day putting    So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C  in it. They're building a system that ejects these at quarter second intervals. That's my dad in the sport coat there  holding the briefcase. So  they had a lot of fun doing this. But no children were allowed  my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn  but he could not say anything more about it. So all my life I have wanted to find this stuff out  and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down. These are stills from the video. Jeff Bezos kindly  yesterday  said he'll put this video up on the Amazon site    some little clip of it. So  thanks to him. They got quite serious about the engineering of this. The size of that mass  for us  is really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to. If you saw the         this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment  that's acceleration profile. And pulse system yield  we're looking at    kiloton yield for an effective thrust of    million newtons. Well  here we have a little problem  the radiation doses at the crew station      rads per shot. Fission yields during development  they were hoping to get clean bombs  they didn't. Eyeburn  this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up. Personnel compartment noise  that's not too bad  it's very low frequencies  it's basically like these sub woofers. And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow up on the pad. Finally  at the very end in       NASA steps in and says   OK  we'll support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together.  So this is what NASA did  getting an eight man version that would go to Mars. They liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like   It's like living in a submarine.  This is crew compartment. It switches  so what's upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode. The scientists were still going to go along  they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists. This is a    man version for going to Jupiter  bunks  storm cellars  exercise room. You know  it was going to be a nice  long trip. The Air Force version  here we have a military version. This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified  just that people managed to sneak home and after  you know  on their deathbed  basically  gave me that. The sort of artist conceptions. These are basically PowerPoint presentations given to the Air Force    years ago. Look at the little guys there outside the vehicle. And one part of NASA was interested in it  but the headquarters in NASA  they killed the project. So finally  at the end  we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to       and then all those paths came to a halt. Results  none. This project is hereby terminated. So that's the end. All I can say in closing is  we heard yesterday that one of the    bad things that could happen to us is an asteroid with our name on it. And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out  and everybody says   Well  what are we going to do   And Orion is really one of the only  if not the only  off the shelf technologies that could do something. So I'm going to tell you the good news and the bad news. The good news is that NASA has a small  secret contingency plan division that is looking at this  trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved in the event of such a misfortune. Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side. That's the good news. The bad news is  when I got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them  they went crazy because I had all this stuff that they don't have  and NASA purchased       pages of this stuff from me. So that's the state we're at  it's not very good. So  what I'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to Kahn's heart  which is  how do we discover what is really particular about a project  How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person  Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization  that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building. And so I'll take you to Wichita  Kansas  where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site  right downtown by the river. And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river  part of the river. Unfortunately  though  the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard so I suggested   Let's reroute McLean   and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard. And it took six months to reroute it. The first image I showed the building committee was this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur because I talked about what makes a building a building of science. And it seemed to me that this structure    complex  rich and yet totally rational  it's an instrument    had something to do with science  and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that. And so my first sketch after I left was to say   Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building.  And I got all excited and came back  and they sort of looked at me in dismay and said   An island  This used to be an island    Ackerman Island    and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs.  And so the process began and they said   You can't put it all on an island  some of it has to be on the mainland because we don't want to turn our back to the community.  And there emerged a design  the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof. And there were all kinds of exciting features  you could come in through the landside buildings  walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape. If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof  peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced  come back and pay the five dollars admission. And the client was happy    well  sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget  but essentially happy. But I was still troubled  and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious. It was complex  but there was something capricious about its complexity. It was  what I would say  compositional complexity  and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about    a building for science    there had to be some kind of a generating idea  some kind of a generating geometry. And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry  one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building. A toroid  for those who don't know  is the surface of a doughnut or  for some of us  a bagel. And out of this idea started spinning off many  many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities  and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits  and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry. And finally the building    this is the model. And when there were complaints about budget  I said   Well  it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money  reflections.  And here's the building as it opened  with a channel overlooking downtown  and as seen from downtown. And the bike route's going right through the building  so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building. The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building  every beam in this building is the same radius  all laminated wood. Every wall  every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building. Every piece of the building works. These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights  and at night  and on opening day. Going back to     . In       I was asked to design a children's memorial museum in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem  which you see here the campus. I was asked to do a building  and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings. And I felt very troubled. I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum  they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with information  it would make them just unable to digest. And so I made a counter proposal  I said   No building.  There was a cave on the site  we tunnel into the hill  descend through the rock into an underground chamber. There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space. There is a single candle flickering in the center  by an arrangement of reflective glasses  it reflects into infinity in all directions. You walk through the space  a voice reads the names  ages and place of birth of the children. This voice does not repeat for six months. And then you descend to light and to the north and to life. Well  they said   People won't understand  they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that.  And they shelved the project. And it sat there for    years  and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles  who had lost his three year old son at Auschwitz  came  saw the model  wrote the check and it got built    years later. So  many years after that in       I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying   We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here. He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem  we took him to the children's memorial  he was extremely moved. He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv   And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me   We Sikhs have suffered a great deal  as you have Jews. I was very moved by what I saw today. We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people  we're about to embark on that. I'd like you to come and design it.  And so  you know  it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously. But two weeks later  I was in this little town  Anandpur Sahib  outside Chandigarh  the capital of the Punjab  and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the Sikhs  Guru Gobind  died in as he wrote the Khalsa  which is their holy scripture. And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there  nine kilometers away from the town and the temple  and said   That's where we have chosen the location.  And I said   This just doesn't make any sense. The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands    they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there. Let's get back to the town and walk to the site.  And I recommended they do it right there  on that hill and this hill  and bridge all the way into the town. And  as things are a little easier in India  the site was purchased within a week and we were working. And my proposal was to split the museum into two    the permanent exhibits at one end  the auditorium  library  and changing exhibitions on the other    to flood the valley into a series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown. And the structures rise from the sand cliffs    they're built in concrete and sandstones  the roofs are stainless steel    they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself  pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other. And as you come from the north  it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. And then I went away for four months and there was going to be groundbreaking. And I came back and  lo and behold  the little model I'd left behind had been built ten times bigger for public display on site and ... the bridge was built  Within the working drawings  And half a million people gathered for the celebrations  you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning. I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction  there are       workers at work and it will be finished in two years. Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began  Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now Washington was built    the Holocaust Museum in Washington    and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information. And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point. They said   Let's rebuild the museum.  But of course  the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter    the Jews make it hard  international competition  phase one  phase two  phase three. And again  I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the Washington building           square feet    will sit on that fragile hill and that we will go into galleries    rooms with doors and sort of familiar rooms    to tell the story of the Holocaust. And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch. Just cut the whole museum through the mountain    enter from one side of the mountain  come out on the other side of the mountain    and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers. And here you see the model  a reception building and some underground parking. You cross a bridge  you enter this triangular room     feet high  which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go towards the north. And all of it  then  all the galleries are underground  and you see the openings for the light. And at night  just one line of light cuts through the mountain  which is a skylight on top of that triangle. And all the galleries  as you move through them and so on  are below grade. And there are chambers carved in the rock    concrete walls  stone  the natural rock when possible    with the light shafts. This is actually a Spanish quarry  which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be. And then  coming towards the north  it opens up  it bursts out of the mountain into  again  a view of light and of the city and of the Jerusalem hills. I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months. It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington  the U.S. Institute of Peace. The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial  you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall  on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia. That too was a competition  and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site. If it were to be anywhere in Washington  it would be an office building  a conference center  a place for negotiating peace and so on    all of which the building is    but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial  this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall. And that was a lot of heat to deal with. The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces    spaces where research goes on  conference centers  a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking    and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition  the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry. You see the structure as  in the sequence of structures on the Mall  very transparent and inviting and looking in. And then as you enter it again  looking in all directions towards the city. And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being    to quote Kundera    that it had to do with whiteness  it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism. And this is where it is  it's sort of evolving. Studies for the structure of the roof  which demands maybe new materials  how to make it white  how to make it translucent  how to make it glowing  how to make it not capricious. And here studying  in three dimensions  how to give some kind  again  of order  a structure  not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process. And so it goes. I'd like to conclude by saying something ... I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term  beauty.  And I know it is not a fashionable term these days  and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools  but it seems to me that all this  in one way or the other  is a search for beauty. Beauty in the most profound sense of fit. I have a quote that I like by a morphologist        Theodore Cook  who said   Beauty connotes humanity. We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness  the perfect fulfillment of function.  Well  I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose. Nevertheless  beauty as the kind of fit  something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled    and our human environment    for that. Twenty years ago  in a conference Richard and I were at together  I wrote a poem  which seems to me to still hold for me today.  He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity. He who seeks order shall find gratification. He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed. He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self expression. He who seeks self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance. Arrogance is incompatible with nature. Through nature  the nature of the universe and the nature of man  we shall seek truth. If we seek truth  we shall find beauty.  Thank you very much.

I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox  and Wendy and I wanted you to do the theme song. And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad  but I kept remaining a fan of yours. And then when I went through that big  horrible breakup with Carl and I couldn't get off the couch  I listened to your song     Now That I Don't Have You     over and over and over and over again. And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED. And also  I can't believe that we're eating sushi in front of the fish tank  which  personally  I think is really inappropriate.

Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine. I mean  I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane visiting my mother. And to my mother  Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope  which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic. Anyway  I like Oprah    I like her girlfriendy ness  I like her weight issues  I like how she's transformed talk television  I like how she's brought reading back to America    but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon Yi moment  it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone. And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie  The Secret.  Do you guys know about that movie  The Secret   It makes  What the Bleep Do We Know  seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics    that's how bad it is. It makes  The DaVinci Code  seem like  War and Peace.  That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience. And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction  and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you. On a scientific basis  it's more than just  Power of Positive Thinking     it has a horrible  horrible dark side. Like if you get ill  it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts. Yeah  stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is  in fact  not a law. So that's what I have to say.

Barry Friedman  There are all kinds of high tech chairs here today  but this is really  I think  when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics  comfort  design  flexibility ... DH  Now obviously  this is not something we do on our regular show  it's something we just kind of learned for this  so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs  BF  Nice show  Daniel  nice show. You are the man  Nice show. Man  that was good  DH  Thank you. BF  You know  sometimes when people do those  they go all the way down. You actually just did that.  Laughter  That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... DH  All right  let's show them something special. BF  ... without a MacArthur grant. Yeah  look at this. You know  all kinds of different ... TED is about invention  let's be honest. Right  DH  Yeah  it is. BF  Last night  Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on. Right now  Dan's going to show something he actually invented. DH  A type of juggling I actually invented  right after I saw another juggler do it. BF  Shut up.  Laughter  DH  And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. Folks  this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down. BF  Oh yeah  it does.  Drum roll  BF  Oh  Daniel. DH  One more   Drum roll  Perfect.  Drum roll  Perfect.  Drum roll  BF  OK. DH  Oh  All right. I'm now pushing my luck  I'm skipping right to six cups. In order to do six cups  I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.  Drum roll  BF  Also three with his left. DH  Perfect. And now  all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose   Laughter  BF  First try  Once on purpose  DH  How about if I try first and then decide  BF  Good idea.  Laughter  Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open. DH  He's looking at me. BF  That's all right  he does that. All right. DH  Oh  It's time for Richard's help.  Laughter  Oh  good. All right. BF  You know  over the years  every year at the conference  it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny  for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons. And then we thought   How stupid.  DH  Excuse me  could we work on the design of the microphone  BF  I think that's the next session. DH  Next session  BF  Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this. He actually assumes more of the danger in this. DH  Please stand up  Richard.  Whip cracks  Oh  sorry.  Laughter  DH  Now Richard  please ...  Whip cracks  BF  OK  sorry. DH  Jesus Christ. Richard  please stand in front of me. Richard Wurman  Can I say something  BF  Sure. RW  In all past years I've rehearsed with them  the things that have happened to me    I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. DH  All right  please stand here in front ... God  I hate that. Put your hands out like this  please. BF  No  come stay up with him. Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection. It's kind of neat. OK. DH  Wow  you've been working out. BF  No  shut up  Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice  that's good. OK  here we go. Have him hold your wrist so I can ... DH  Please hold my wrist  will you. BF  Yeah  hold this a minute. There you go. OK. OK  hold on. RW  Hmmm. DH  First one. BF  All those mid year phone calls are coming back to me now  Richard. DH  So Richard  what were we on the list  Like        What happened there  BF  I think we were just outside. DH  I don't get it.  Applause  DH  Sorry. BF  Having some bad flashbacks. RW  Do you want me to hold you or not  DH  Don't hold me that hard. BF  Here we go  I'm taking it.  Balloon pops   Applause  DH  One more  one more. BF  We've got one more we're going to do. RW  Do I get to hold them  BF  You don't want to hold these  trust me. DH  Could you spread your legs a little bit  BF  Gloria  you want to do it  It's very cool. One more try. Man  I don't want to get too close. Could you just push that  DH  Wow  Boy  BF  That's cool. I always wanted to try that. DH  Let's jump this way  though. Now  we risked Richard's life  it's only fair we risk our own lives. So to do that  I will juggle these three razor sharp sickles. And if that wasn't enough  and judging by your response  it's not ... DH  Wow  BF  Hoping for a little more build. DH  True. Barry ... BF  I'm going to run up behind him. DH  Leap over my shoulder. BF  Up and over his shoulders. DH  Grab the blades in mid air  land right there in a pool of blood ... Still juggling.  Laughter  Impossible  you say  BF  Incredible  you say  DH  Why bother  you say  BF  Here we go. DH  Just do it juggler boys  you say  BF  This guy  this guy invented air. DH  I think so  that's right. Even the pencil. BF  He invented the pencil. DH  All right  we'll do this trick  but please remember it took us over    years to perfect. BF  Ten years to perfect  which you're about to see. DH  It's not that difficult  we just don't like to practice that much. BF  No  it's a hassle. Traveling too much. Actually  we will take a second to prove    this could be fake    that the blades are indeed razor sharp. DH  Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage  Or a virgin for a sacrifice  BF  Anything  DH  Where's Gloria   Laughter  BF  No  she's got ... farm animal. DH  Do you have a small farm animal  Just trying to play the odds. All right  here we go. BF  Over the top  over the top. DH  How you feeling  Barry  You feeling all right  BF  Yeah  it's all right. DH  Do you feel everything's OK  The atmosphere  the ... BF  Yeah  a little sketchy. DH  Everything up here's OK  BF  Yeah. DH  Then here we go. BF  This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights  Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs  Is that possible   Laughter  I can still see a little. DH  And turn up the intensity  we're still pink in the middle. We went too far.  Laughter  BF  Yeah  it's too far. It's too much of a visual. The design of the body is a whole different thing. DH  Ready  Barry  BF  Over the top. DH  May we have our jumping music please   Silence  May we have it a bit louder  BF  They're a good crew  Whoa  DH  Whoa  sorry. All right. BF  We're going on. DH  All right  we'll try again. BF  All right  Oh my gosh. Oh. DH  All right  here we go. Sorry about that. BF  I thought I had the hard part. OK. DH  Whenever you're ready. BF  There we go  All right  get up  Come on and dance  DH  Dance  come on. BF  Come on and dance  Somebody dance  Come on  Wow  wow  OK  stop. Weird  no one dances. We're two guys doing this.  Laughter  I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. DH  The French judge ... BF  One more quick thing. DH  The French judge gives it a  . . BF  Well  you know ... DH  There you go ... BF  Oh  yeah. Another one coming in. DH  Tell them about our bio and stuff. BF  Yeah. In our bio  some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships. And believe it or not  you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups. We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition. DH  That's right. BF  Good. DH  I know what you're thinking  other juggling teams must really suck. BF  Juggling's got a bad rap. DH  But wait  Barry  there's still one more club lying there by my foot. And look  it has a twin  BF  Shut up.  Laughter  DH  There's still one more by my foot. What do you want me to do with it  BF  Richard you tell him  it's your last year.  Laughter  DH  That's a pretty good setup  Richard. BF  Yeah  it's a good setup. That's a big setup. DH  You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do  I will use my panther like reflexes. BF  Nice. DH  I got that    to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. BF  Nice. DH  I touched it  Barry. That should be enough. BF  It's progress  that's the thing. DH  How about that  I'll do it again. Oh wait  it's on your side  Barry. And it's awfully windy over there. BF  It is  it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage  but it is. It's weird. Watch this  what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. DH  Wow  What a great trick  Barry  Oh  look how it lies there. Oh  Barry  is there nothing you can't do  You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea  Jr. Too much Olympics. BF  From my foot  I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. DH  Where  Barry  Where  Tell us  Barry.  Unclear  eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be  What gem of knowledge  What pearl of wisdom  Do you want to buy a vowel  Barry  Is that your final answer  BF  All right  You have to turn off the TV from time to time. DH  I do  I do. BF  From my foot  the kick up in the seven. DH  We will juggle seven. BF  From six to seven. DH  That's a world's record. BF  Really  DH  For us. BF  Yes. DH  Whenever you're ready there  big guy. Put your tongue away  Barry. BF  Oh  oh  whoa. DH  Please  please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. Because now  to make this twice as difficult  we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... BF  Seven club juggling. DH  ... to back. BF  Thank you  that's it. BF  Thank you guys  DH  Thank you very much  My name is Joseph  a Member of Parliament in Kenya. Picture a Maasai village  and one evening  government soldiers come  surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school. That's how I went to school    pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father   You have to make a choice.  I walked very comfortably to this missionary school  that was run by an American missionary. The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy. I had never in my life ever tasted candy. So I said to myself  with all these hundred other boys  this is where I belong. When everybody else was dropping out. My family moved  we're nomads. It was a boarding school  I was seven    Every time it closed you had to travel to find them.       miles  it doesn't matter. You slept in the bush  but you kept going. And I stayed. I don't know why  but I did. All of a sudden I passed the national examination  found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya. And I finished high school. And just walking  I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States. My mother still lived in a cow dung hut  none of my brothers were going to school  and this man told me   Here  go.  I got a scholarship to St. Lawrence University  Upstate New York  finished that. And after that I went to Harvard Graduate School  finished that. Then I worked in DC a little bit  I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history. And every time  I kept going back home  listening to their problems    sick people  people with no water  all this stuff    every time I go back to America  I kept thinking about them. Then one day  an elder gave me a story that went like this  long time ago  there was a big war between tribes. This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe. Every time  they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them. So one day  the scouts came running and told the villagers   The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away  they'll be here.  So people scrambled  took their things and ready to go  move out. But there were two men  one man was blind  one man had no legs    he was born like that. The leader of the chiefs said   No  sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down. We have to flee our women and children  we have to run.  And they were left behind  waiting to die. But these two people worked something out. The blind man said   Look  I'm a very strong man but I can't see.  The man with no legs says   I can see as far as the end of the world  but I can't save myself from a cat  or whatever animals.  The blind man went down on his knees like this  and told the man with no legs to go over his back  and stood up. The man on top can see  the blind man can walk. These guys took off  followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them. So  this was told to me in a setup of elders. And it's a really poor area. I represent Northern Kenya  the most nomadic  remote areas you can even find. And that man told me   So  here you are. You've got a good education from America  you have a good life in America  what are you going to do for us  We want you to be our eyes  we'll give you the legs. We'll walk you  you lead us.  The opportunity came. I was always thinking about that   What can I do to help my people  Every time you go to an area where for    years of independence  we still don't have basic health facilities. A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow    km for a hospital. No clean drinking water. So I said   I'm going to dedicate myself. I'm leaving America. I'm going to run for office.  Last June  I moved from America  ran in July election and won. And I came for them  and that's my goal. Right now I have in place  for the last nine months  a plan that in five years  every nomad will have clean drinking water. We're building dispensaries across that constituency. I'm asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out. I'm trying to improve infrastructure. I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward. I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because people from outside can come and help us  but if we don't help ourselves  there's nothing to do. My plan right now as I continue with introducing students to different fields    some become doctors  some lawyers    we want to produce a comprehensive group of people  students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession. As I continue to be a Member of Parliament and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany  health  democracy  new inventions  I'm hoping that one day in my own little community    which is        square km  maybe five times Rhode Island    with no roads  we'll be able to become a model to help others develop. Thank you very much. By day  I'm a venture capitalist. On weekends  I love rockets. I love photography  I love rockets  and I'm going to talk to you about a hobby that can scale and show you some photos that I've taken over the years with kids like these  kids that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become maybe another Richard Branson or Diamandis. My son designed a rocket that became stable  a golf ball rocket    I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science    and it flies straight as an arrow. Baking soda and vinegar. Night shots are beautiful  piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way. Two stage rockets  rockets with video cameras on them  on board computers logging their flights  rocket gliders that fly back to Earth. I use RockSim to simulate flights before they go to see if they'll break supersonic or not  and then fly them with on board computers to verify their performance. But to launch the really big stuff  you go to the middle of nowhere  Black Rock Desert  where dangerous things happen. And the boys get bigger  and the rockets get bigger.  Laughter  And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters. They rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle. These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide. They use solid propellant most frequently. It's a strange kind of love. We have a RocketMavericks.com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this  participate  be a spectator. Mavericks  we had to call it Rocket Mavericks. This one was great  it went to         feet  but didn't quite. Actually  it went    feet into the solid clay  and it became a bunker buster  drilling down into the clay. It had to be dug out. Rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them. Here was a drag race. At night you can see what happened in a second  in daytime  we call them land sharks. Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic. To take this shot  I do what I often do  which is go way beyond the pads where none of the other spectators are. And if we can run the video  I'll show you what it took to get this DreamWorks shot. Steve Jurvetson  This is rare. Here's where they realized the computer's failed. They're yelling deploy. Voices  Oh shit. SJ  This is when they realize everything on board's gone haywire. Voices  It's going ballistic. Oh shit. SJ  And I'll just be quiet. Voices  No. Up  up  up. SJ  And that's me over there  taking photos the whole way. Things often go wrong. Some people watch this event because of a NASCAR like fascination with things bumping and grinding. Burning the parachute as it fell    that was last weekend. This guy went up  went supersonic  ripped the fin can off    yard sale in the sky    and a burning metal hunk coming back. These things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch. It's a cadence you can't quite imagine. And in many ways  I try to capture the mishaps  it's the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second. Why do they do it  It's for things like this  Gene from Alabama drives out there with this rocket that he's built with X ray sensors  video cameras  festooned with electronics  and he succeeds getting to         feet  leaving the atmosphere  seeing a thin blue line of space. It is this breathtaking image    success  of course    that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science  to understand the importance of physics and math and  in many ways  to sort of have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown. Thank you. Roy Gould  Less than a year from now  the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy  which marks the    th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope. In a few months  the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research  which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago. It's called the WorldWide Telescope  and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention. And I want to urge you  when you get a chance  to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs. The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space  and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe. It's going to change the way we do astronomy  it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe. If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day  that might not be so big a claim. In       for example  you weren't allowed to drink  if you were a woman  you weren't allowed to vote  and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night  what you saw was thought to be the entire universe. In fact  the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe. Harvard was wrong  big time.  Laughter  Of course  we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy. We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe  all the way back in time  almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself. We can see across the entire spectrum of light  revealing worlds that had previously been invisible. We see these magnificent star nurseries  where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise. We see alien worlds  we see alien solar systems        now  and still counting    and they're not like us. We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy  in the Milky Way  and elsewhere in the universe  where time itself seems to stand still. But until now  our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented  and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing. I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I  in astronomy and in education  are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative. First  it enables you to experience the universe  the WorldWide Telescope  for me  is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go. Second  you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides. And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing  but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe  who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place. And third  you can create your own tours    you can share them with friends  you can create them with friends    and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart  we are all storytellers. And in telling stories  each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way. We're going to have a personal universe. I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge. Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope  I just want to leave you with this brief thought  when I ask people   How does the night sky make you feel   they often say   Oh  tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant.  Well  our gaze fills the universe. And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope  we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe. I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny  but we are truly  wonderfully significant. Thank you. I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft.  Applause  Curtis Wong  Thank you  Roy. So  what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation  but it's one of the tours. And actually this tour is one that was created earlier. And the tours are all totally interactive  so that if I were to go somewhere ... you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way  pull up other information    there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go    you can zoom in  you can pull back out. The whole resources are there available for you. So  Microsoft    this is a project that    WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray  who's our colleague  and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible. It's a labor of love for us and our small team  and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe. So basically  kids of all ages  like us. And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring. It'll be a free download    thank you  Craig Mundie    and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org  which is something new. And so  what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here  and in the TED Lab  we have a tour that was created by a six year old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off.  Laughter  So we'll see you there. Thank you.
