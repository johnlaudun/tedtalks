I love video games. I'm also slightly in awe of them. I'm in awe of their power in terms of imagination  in terms of technology  in terms of concept. But I think  above all  I'm in awe at their power to motivate  to compel us  to transfix us  like really nothing else we've ever invented has quite done before. And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things by looking at how we do this. And in particular  I think we can learn things about learning. Now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media. From about    billion in       it's worth    billion dollars globally today  and it shows no sign of slowing down. In four years' time  it's estimated it'll be worth over    billion dollars. That's about three times the recorded music industry. This is pretty stunning  but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all. The thing that really amazes me is that  today  people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games. This is a screenshot from the virtual game world  Entropia Universe. Earlier this year  a virtual asteroid in it sold for         real dollars. And this is a Titan class ship in the space game  EVE Online. And this virtual object takes     real people about    days of real time to build  plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that. And yet  many of these get built. At the other end of the scale  the game Farmville that you may well have heard of  has    million players around the world and most of these players are playing it almost every day. This may all sound really quite alarming to some people  an index of something worrying or wrong in society. But we're here for the good news  and the good news is that I think we can explore why this very real human effort  this very intense generation of value  is occurring. And by answering that question  I think we can take something extremely powerful away. And I think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards. And specifically  it's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively. Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head when they are being engaged  two quite different processes are occurring. On the one hand  there's the wanting processes. This is a bit like ambition and drive    I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard. On the other hand  there's the liking processes  fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back. It's a really great image. It's pretty cool. It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than    million players globally  one of whom is me  another of whom is my wife. And this kind of a world  this vast flying beast you can ride around  shows why games are so very good at doing both the wanting and the liking. Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome. It gives you great powers. Your ambition is satisfied  but it's very beautiful. It's a very great pleasure to fly around. And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement. But this isn't the really interesting stuff. The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it. Because what you can measure in virtuality is everything. Every single thing that every single person who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured. The biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players  about what everybody does    far more detail than you'd ever get from any website. And this allows something very special to happen in games. It's something called the reward schedule. And by this  I mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate  the nature  the type  the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort. Now  to try and explain this in sort of real terms  I want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games. Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game y item. Let's say  for the sake of argument  my mission is to get    pies and I can get    pies by killing these cute  little monsters. Simple game quest. Now you can think about this  if you like  as a problem about boxes. I've got to keep opening boxes. I don't know what's inside them until I open them. And I go around opening box after box until I've got    pies. Now  if you take a game like Warcraft  you can think about it  if you like  as a great box opening effort. The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes  getting better and better stuff in them. This sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling. And the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data. Let's think about probability. If we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies  we want to make sure it's neither too easy  nor too difficult  to find a pie. So what do you do  Well  you look at a million people    no      million people      million box openers    and you work out  if you make the pie rate about    percent    that's neither too frustrating  nor too easy. It keeps people engaged. But of course  that's not all you do    there's    pies. Now  I could make a game called Piecraft  where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies. That would be very boring. Fifteen is a pretty optimal number. You find that    you know  between five and    is about the right number for keeping people going. But we don't just have pies in the boxes. There's     percent up here. And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened  there's something in it  some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged. In most adventure games  it's a little bit in game currency  a little bit experience. But we don't just do that either. We also say there's going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement. There's going to be a    percent chance you get a pretty good item. There's going to be a  .  percent chance you get an absolutely awesome item. And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item. And also  we say   Well  how many monsters  Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters   No  we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time. So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy  not too difficult. So all this is very powerful. But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes. So we can do some rather amazing things. We notice  looking at all these people opening boxes  that when people get to about    out of    pies  their perception shifts  they start to get a bit bored  a bit testy. They're not rational about probability. They think this game is unfair. It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up. If they're real boxes  there's not much we can do  but in a game we can just say   Right  well. When you get to    pies  you've got    percent chance of getting a pie now.  Keep you engaged. Look at what people do    adjust the world to match their expectation. Our games don't always do this. And one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a  .  percent awesome item  they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value  to keep it special. And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways. Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years  we evolved to find certain things stimulating  and as very intelligent  civilized beings  we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning. But now  we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes. So what does all this mean in practice  Well  I've come up with seven things that  I think  show how you can take these lessons from games and use them outside of games. The first one is very simple  experience bars measuring progress    something that's been talked about brilliantly by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year. It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States  among other places. It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally in little bits and pieces  you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny  tiny  tiny little increments which they feel are their own. And everything comes towards that  and they watch it creeping up  and they own that as it goes along. Second  multiple long and short term aims          pies  boring     pies  interesting. So  you give people lots and lots of different tasks. You say  it's about doing    of these questions  but another task is turning up to    classes on time  but another task is collaborating with other people  another task is showing you're working five times  another task is hitting this particular target. You break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities. Third  you reward effort. It's your     percent factor. Games are brilliant at this. Every time you do something  you get credit  you get a credit for trying. You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort    a little bit of gold  a little bit of credit. You've done    questions    tick. It all feeds in as minute reinforcement. Fourth  feedback. This is absolutely crucial  and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this. If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we've been hearing amazing things about  it's very  very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions. Pollution  global warming  these things    the consequences are distant in time and space. It's very hard to learn  to feel a lesson. But if you can model things for people  if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes  then they can learn a lesson  they can see  they can move on  they can understand. And fifth  the element of uncertainty. Now this is the neurological goldmine  if you like  because a known reward excites people  but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward  the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty  that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not. The    percent. This lights the brain up. And if you think about using this in testing  in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training  you can transform the levels of people's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism. When we don't quite predict something perfectly  we get really excited about it. We just want to go back and find out more. As you probably know  the neurotransmitter associated with learning is called dopamine. It's associated with reward seeking behavior. And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.  where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain. And what this means is we can predict learning  we can predict enhanced engagement  these windows  these windows of time  in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level. And two things really flow from this. The first has to do with memory  that we can find these moments. When someone is more likely to remember  we can give them a nugget in a window. And the second thing is confidence  that we can see how game playing and reward structures make people braver  make them more willing to take risks  more willing to take on difficulty  harder to discourage. This can all seem very sinister. But you know  sort of  our brains have been manipulated  we're all addicts.  The word  addiction  is thrown around. There are real concerns there. But the biggest neurological turn on for people is other people. This is what really excites us. In reward terms  it's not money  it's not being given cash    that's nice    it's doing stuff with our peers  watching us  collaborating with us. And I want to tell you a quick story about         a video game called EverQuest. And in this video game  there were two really big dragons  and you had to team up to kill them       people  up to    to kill these big dragons. That's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items. So players addressed this problem by spontaneously coming up with a system to motivate each other  fairly and transparently. What happened was  they paid each other a virtual currency they called  dragon kill points.  And every time you turned up to go on a mission  you got paid in dragon kill points. They tracked these on a separate website. So they tracked their own private currency  and then players could bid afterwards for cool items they wanted    all organized by the players themselves. Now the staggering system  not just that this worked in EverQuest  but that today  a decade on  every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system    tens of millions of people. And the success rate is at close to     percent. This is a player developed  self enforcing  voluntary currency  and it's incredibly sophisticated player behavior. And I just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world. Let's start with business. I mean  we're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation. We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real time energy meters. And I just look at this  and I think  yes  we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets  by using elements of uncertainty  by using these multiple targets  by using a grand  underlying reward and incentive system  by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups  in terms of streets to collaborate and compete  to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see. In terms of education  perhaps most obviously of all  we can transform how we engage people. We can offer people the grand continuity of experience and personal investment. We can break things down into highly calibrated small tasks. We can use calculated randomness. We can reward effort consistently as everything fields together. And we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together  these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms. Government  well  one thing that comes to mind is the U.S. government  among others  is literally starting to pay people to lose weight. So we're seeing financial reward being used to tackle the great issue of obesity. But again  those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal  to take the data  to take the observations  of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement. And in the end  it's this word   engagement   that I want to leave you with. It's about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and the neurological lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games. But it's also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games. And if we can look at these things and learn from them and see how to turn them outwards  then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. Thank you very much. So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does. We stand in elections  we vote in elections  we observe elections. Our democracies rely on elections. We all understand why we have elections  and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote. We cherish the opportunity to have our say  to help decide the future of the country. The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us  to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all. Without that mandate  they would be corrupt. Well unfortunately  power corrupts  and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power  including doing bad things to elections. You see  even if the idea of the election is perfect  running a countrywide election is a big project  and big projects are messy. Whenever there is an election  it seems like something always goes wrong  someone tries to cheat  or something goes accidentally awry    a ballot box goes missing here  chads are left hanging over here. To make sure as few things as possible go wrong  we have all these procedures around the election. So for example  you come to the polling station  and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote. When you come back out  you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes  so that no one knows how you voted. Well  what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that  after you drop your vote into the ballot box. And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted  because they trust that the election system works. They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly. The ballot boxes go to counting places. They're unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted. Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote  and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election. So we have to trust a lot of people. We have to trust a lot of procedures. And sometimes we even have to trust computers. So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes  all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines  and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better. Well in the face of all these bad headlines  researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently. They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture. And the big picture is this  elections should be verifiable. Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly  without breaking election secrecy  which is so very important. And that's the tough part. How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret  Well  the way we've come up with uses computers but doesn't depend on them. And the secret is the ballot form. And if you look closely at these ballot forms  you'll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one. And that means  if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list  I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for. And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this  D barcode on the right. And there's some complicated cryptography going on in there  but what's not complicated is voting with one of these forms. So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us  and then we'll use the paper for verification. So this is how you vote. You get one of these ballot forms at random  and then you go into the voting booth  and you mark your choices  and you tear along a perforation. And you shred the candidate list. And the bit that remains  the one with your marks    this is your encrypted vote. So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote. And because it's encrypted  it can be submitted  stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see  including you. So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt. And after the close of the election  you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website. And remember  the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth  so if an election official wants to find out how you voted  they will not be able to. If the government wants to find out how you voted  they won't be able to. No hacker can break in and find out how you voted. No hacker can break in and change your vote  because then it won't match your receipt. Votes can't go missing because then you won't find yours when you look for it. But the election magic doesn't stop there. Instead  we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves. They can check that all the votes were counted correctly. They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one. And these are elections by the people  for the people. So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections. Thank you. I guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the     s  when I was seven or eight years old  watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on. Then after every episode  I had to go up to the bathtub and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain  because that's all there was to look at. And by the time I turned     I pursued a career in marine science  in exploration and diving  and lived in underwater habitats  like this one off the Florida Keys  for    days total. Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks  Brian. And I've dived in deep sea submersibles around the world. And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world  operated by the Japanese government. And Sylvia Earle and I were on an expedition in this submarine    years ago in Japan. And on my dive  I went down        feet  to an area that I thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor. But when I got there  I found lots of plastic garbage and other debris. And it was really a turning point in my life  where I started to realize that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration. I needed to put it into a context. I needed to head towards conservation goals. So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica. I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica. Ten years ago was a seminal trip  where we explored that big iceberg  B     the largest iceberg in history  that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf. And we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg  such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around  so that  as the blood flowed through our kidneys  it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies. But after three trips to Antarctica  I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water. And that same year     years ago  I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment. But before I do  I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment. You may have seen this in other forms  but the top line is the amount of protected area on land  globally  and it's about    percent. And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the     s and '  s  and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now. And that's probably because that's when everybody got aware of the environment and Earth Day and all the stuff that happened in the '  s with the Hippies and everything really did  I think  have an affect on global awareness. But the ocean protected area is basically flat line until right about now    it appears to be ticking up. And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point of the protected area in the ocean. I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like we can see what happens on land. But unfortunately  the ocean is opaque  and we can't see what's going on. And therefore we're way behind on protection. But scuba diving  submersibles and all the work that we're setting about to do here will help rectify that. So where are the Phoenix Islands  They were the world's largest marine protected area up until last week when the Chagos Archipelago was declared. It's in the mid Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere. If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands  it's five days from Fiji  it's five days from Hawaii  it's five days from Samoa. It's out in the middle of the Pacific  right around the Equator. I had never heard of the islands    years ago  nor the country  Kiribati  that owns them  till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji said   Greg  would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands  They've never been dived.  And I said   Yeah. But tell me where they are and the country that owns them.  So that's when I first learned of the Islands and had no idea what I was getting into. But I was in for the adventure. Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands protected area. It's a very deep water part of our planet. The average depths are about        ft. There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands  which are specifically part of the protected area. Seamounts are important for biodiversity. There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land. It's an interesting fact. And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts. So it's a deep    think about it in a big three dimensional space  very deep three dimensional space with herds of tuna  whales  all kinds of deep sea marine life like we've seen here before. That's the vessel that we took up there for these studies  early on  and that's what the Islands look like    you can see in the background. They're very low to the water  and they're all uninhabited  except one island has about    caretakers on it. And they've been uninhabited for most of time because even in the ancient days  these islands were too far away from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti for those ancient Polynesian mariners that were traversing the Pacific so widely. But we got up there  and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go   Okay  where are we going to dive  Let's try there   and then falling into the water. Both my personal and my professional life changed. Suddenly  I saw a world that I had never seen before in the ocean    schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface  coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful  large fish everywhere  manta rays. It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning    this is about       longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands. You can see the fish are balled up and then there's a little cloudy area there where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction    events that the ocean is supposed to do  but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity. The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries  especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here. Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location. And sharks    we had sharks on our early dives  up to     sharks at once  which is an indication of a very  very healthy  very strong  system. So I thought the scenes of never ending wilderness would go on forever  but they did finally come to an end. And we explored the surface of the Islands as well    very important bird nesting site  some of the most important bird nesting sites in the Pacific  in the world. And we finished our trip. And that's the area again. You can see the Islands    there are eight islands    that pop out of the water. The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts. Remember  a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface. And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands  Where do these exist  Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati  and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific in three island groups. In the west we have the Gilbert Islands. In the center we have the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject that I'm talking about. And then over to the east we have the Line Islands. It's the largest atoll nation in the world. And they have about         people spread out over    islands. They control  .  million cubic miles of ocean  and that's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet. And when I was first going up there  I barely knew the name of this country    years ago  and people would ask me   Why are you going to this place called Kiribati   And it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed  and the reporter yells   Hey  Willy. Why do you rob banks   And he says   cause that's where all the money is.  And I would tell people   Why do I go to Kiribati  Because that's where all the ocean is.  They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the Central Pacific Ocean. They're also a country that is in dire danger. Sea levels are rising  and Kiribati  along with    other nations in the world  will be under water within    to     years due to climate change and the associated sea level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean. The Islands rise only one to two meters above the surface. Some of the islands have already gone under water. And these nations are faced with a real problem. We as a world are faced with a problem. What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet  The president of the Maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries. So it's something we need to focus on. But back to the Phoenix Islands  which is the subject of this Talk. After I got back  I said  okay  this is amazing  what we found. I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati  who are over in Tarawa  the westernmost group. So I started contacting them    because they had actually given me a permit to do this    and I said   I want to come up and tell you what we found.  And for some reason they didn't want me to come  or it was hard to find a time and a place  and it took a while  but finally they said   Okay  you can come. But if you come  you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar.  So I said   Okay  I'm happy to buy lunch. Just get whatever anybody wants.  So David Obura  a coral reef biologist  and I went to Tarawa  and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands. And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area. They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands. After the talk  the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me and he said   Greg  do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever come back and told us what they did   He said   We often issue these permits to do research in our waters  but usually we get a note two or three years later  or a reprint. But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did. And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today. And are you free for dinner   And I was free for dinner  and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati. And over the course of dinner  I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue    it's a very poor country    but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters  because Kiribati does not have the capacity to take the fish itself. And the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives Kiribati five percent of the landed value. So if the United States removes a million dollars' worth of lobsters from a reef  Kiribati gets        dollars. And  you know  it didn't seem like a very good deal to me. So I asked the Minister over dinner  I said   Would you consider a situation where you would still get paid    we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is    but you leave fish and the sharks and the shrimp in the water   He stopped  and he said   Yes  we would like to do that to deal with our overfishing problem  and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.  He coined the term  reverse fishing license.  So I said   Yes  a 'reverse fishing license.'  So we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point. I went back to the States and started looking around to see if I could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued  and it turned out there were none. There were no oceanic deals where countries were compensated for not fishing. It had occurred on land  in rainforests of South America and Africa  where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down. And Conservation International had struck some of those deals. So I went to Conservation International and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource  deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated  what the range of the fishes were  brought in a whole bunch of other partners    the government of Australia  the government of New Zealand  the World Bank. The Oak Foundation and National Geographic have been big funders of this as well. And we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this very poor country to keep the area intact. Halfway through this process  I met the president of Kiribati  President Anote Tong. He's a really important leader  a real visionary  forward thinking man  and he told me two things when I approached him. He said   Greg  there's two things I'd like you to do. One is  remember I'm a politician  so you've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea. Secondly  I'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency. I don't want to do something like this if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.  So we had very strong leadership  very good vision and a lot of science  a lot of lawyers involved. Many  many steps were taken to pull this off. And it was primarily because Kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this. They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community. Then in       when this was all going full swing  a coral bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands. Here's this resource that we're looking to save  and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record. The ocean heated up as it does sometimes  and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months. It was over    degrees Celsius for six months and it basically killed    percent of the coral. So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting  but now it appeared to be dead  at least in the coral areas. Of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine  but the coral  which everybody likes to look at  was in trouble. Well  the good news is it's recovered and recovering fast  faster than any reef we've seen. This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago when we returned to the Phoenix Islands and discovered that  because it is a protected area and has healthy fish populations that keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy  the coral is booming  is just booming back. It's almost like if a person has multiple diseases  it's hard to get well  you might die  but if you only have one disease to deal with  you can get better. And that's the story with climate change heating. It's the only threat  the only influence that the reef had to deal with. There was no fishing  there was no pollution  there was no coastal development  and the reef is on a full bore recovery. Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries    years ago when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner and said   Well  I think that the conservation community might embrace this idea  Minister.  He paused and put his hands together and said   Yes  Greg  but the devil will be in the details   he said. And it certainly was. The last    years have been detail after detail ranging from creating legislation to multiple research expeditions to communication plans  as I said  teams of lawyers  MOUs  creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board. And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment. Kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment. We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago. So it's a fully functional up and running entity that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country. And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license and pays the country for this. So it's a very solid  very well thought out  very well grounded system  and it was a bottom up system  and that was very important with this work  from the bottom up to secure this. So the conditions for success here are listed. You can read them yourselves. But I would say the most important one in my mind was working within the market forces of the situation. And that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self interest of Kiribati as well as the self interest of the world. And I'll leave you with one final slide  that is  how do we scale this up  How do we realize Sylvia's dream  Where eventually do we take this  Here's the Pacific with large MPAs and large conservation zones on it. And as you can see  we have a patchwork across this ocean. I've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle  the Phoenix Islands  but every other green patch on that has its own story. And what we need to do now is look at the whole Pacific Ocean in its entirety and make a network of MPAs across the Pacific so that we have our world's largest ocean protected and self sustaining over time. Thank you very much.  Applause  I have a doppelganger. Dr. Gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the  Dragonball Z  Android Saga.  If you look very carefully  you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light. That's exactly what I do    optical mind control. But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination  my motives are not sinister. I control the brain in order to understand how it works. Now wait a minute  you may say  how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first  Isn't that putting the cart before the horse  Many neuroscientists agree with this view and think that understanding will come from more detailed observation and analysis. They say   If we could record the activity of our neurons  we would understand the brain.  But think for a moment what that means. Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times  we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns  and that's so difficult  chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them. Take a look at what brain activity might look like. In this simulation  each black dot is one nerve cell. The dot is visible whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse. There's        neurons here. So you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach. Your brains are about     million times more complicated. Somewhere  in a pattern like this  is you  your perceptions  your emotions  your memories  your plans for the future. But we don't know where  since we don't know how to read the pattern. We don't understand the code used by the brain. To make progress  we need to break the code. But how  An experienced code breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean  it's essential to be able to play with them  to rearrange them at will. So in this situation too  to decode the information contained in patterns like this  watching alone won't do. We need to rearrange the pattern. In other words  instead of recording the activity of neurons  we need to control it. It's not essential that we can control the activity of all neurons in the brain  just some. The more targeted our interventions  the better. And I'll show you in a moment how we can achieve the necessary precision. And since I'm realistic  rather than grandiose  I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system will at once unravel all its mysteries. But we'll certainly learn a lot. Now  I'm by no means the first person to realize how powerful a tool intervention is. The history of attempts to tinker with the function of the nervous system is long and illustrious. It dates back at least     years  to Galvani's famous experiments in the late   th century and beyond. Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched when he connected the lumbar nerve to a source of electrical current. This experiment revealed the first  and perhaps most fundamental  nugget of the neural code  that information is written in the form of electrical impulses. Galvani's approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state of the art until today  despite a number of drawbacks. Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude. It's hard to do in animals that run around  and there is a physical limit to the number of wires that can be inserted simultaneously. So around the turn of the last century  I started to think   Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down   So instead of inserting a wire into one spot of the brain  re engineer the brain itself so that some of its neural elements become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals such as a flash of light. Such an approach would literally  in a flash of light  overcome many of the obstacles to discovery. First  it's clearly a non invasive  wireless form of communication. And second  just as in a radio broadcast  you can communicate with many receivers at once. You don't need to know where these receivers are  and it doesn't matter if these receivers move    just think of the stereo in your car. It gets even better  for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers out of materials that are encoded in DNA. So each nerve cell with the right genetic makeup will spontaneously produce a receiver that allows us to control its function. I hope you'll appreciate the beautiful simplicity of this concept. There's no high tech gizmos here  just biology revealed through biology. Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close. As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons  we see that its outer membrane is studded with microscopic pores. Pores like these conduct electrical current and are responsible for all the communication in the nervous system. But these pores here are special. They are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes. Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor  the pore opens  an electrical current is switched on  and the neuron fires electrical impulses. Because the light activated pore is encoded in DNA  we can achieve incredible precision. This is because  although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes  different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells. You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light activated pore and others don't. So in this cartoon  the bluish white cell in the upper left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light activated pore. The approach works so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain. In this example  each electrical impulse  each deflection on the trace  is caused by a brief pulse of light. And the approach  of course  also works in moving  behaving animals. This is the first ever such experiment  sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's. It was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student  Susana Lima. Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left so that just two out of the         cells in its brain expressed the light activated pore. You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly. They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position. And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect. The animal jumps  it spreads its wings  it vibrates them  but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates. Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see  Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment. She cut the heads off of her flies. These headless bodies can live for about a day  but they don't do much. They just stand around and groom excessively. So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity. Anyway  as you'll see in a moment  Susana was able to turn on the flight motor of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies and get some of the headless bodies to actually take off and fly away. They didn't get very far  obviously. Since we took these first steps  the field of optogenetics has exploded. And there are now hundreds of labs using these approaches. And we've come a long way since Galvani's and Susana's first successes in making animals twitch or jump. We can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways  as I'll show you in my last example  which is directed at a familiar question. Life is a string of choices creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next. We cope with this pressure by having brains  and within our brains  decision making centers that I've called here the  Actor.  The Actor implements a policy that takes into account the state of the environment and the context in which we operate. Our actions change the environment  or context  and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. Now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model  we constructed a simple one dimensional world for our favorite subject  fruit flies. Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly. The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors  and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them. Here's some such CCTV footage. Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet  it has to make a decision. It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor  or whether to cross the midline and try something new. These decisions are clearly a reflection of the Actor's policy. Now for an intelligent being like our fly  this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal learns from experience. We can incorporate such an element of adaptive intelligence into our model by assuming that the fly's brain contains not only an Actor  but a different group of cells  a  Critic   that provides a running commentary on the Actor's choices. You can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the Catholic Church  if you're an Austrian like me  or the super ego  if you're Freudian  or your mother  if you're Jewish. Now obviously  the Critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent. So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic. And the logic of our experiment was simple. We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic  we should be able  artificially  to nag the Actor into changing its policy. In other words  the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but  in reality  it had not made. So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable. And then we took these flies and allowed them to make choices. And whenever they made one of the two choices  chose one odor  in this case the blue one over the orange one  we switched on the lights. If the Critic was among the optically activated cells  the result of this intervention should be a change in policy. The fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor. Here's what happened in two instances  We're comparing two strains of flies  each of them having about     light addressable cells in their brains  shown here in green on the left and on the right. What's common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. But the identities of the individual dopamine producing neurons are clearly largely different on the left and on the right. Optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences. If you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right  you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet  it marches straight through  as it did before. Its behavior is completely unchanged. But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different. Whenever it comes up to the midpoint  it pauses  it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment  and then it turns around. This means that the policy that the Actor implements now includes an instruction to avoid the odor that's in the right half of the chamber. This means that the Critic must have spoken in that animal  and that the Critic must be contained among the dopamine producing neurons on the left  but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. Through many such experiments  we were able to narrow down the identity of the Critic to just    cells. These    cells  as shown here in green  send the output to a brain structure called the  mushroom body   which is shown here in gray. We know from our formal model that the brain structure at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor. So this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice. Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies  this makes perfect sense. In fact  it makes so much sense that we can construct an electronic toy circuit that simulates the behavior of the fly. In this electronic toy circuit  the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue LEDs in the center of the board. These LED's are wired to sensors that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air. Each odor activates a different combination of sensors  which in turn activates a different odor detector in the mushroom body. So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly  the Actor  can tell which odor is present simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. What the Actor does with this information depends on its policy  which is stored in the strengths of the connection  between the odor detectors and the motors that power the fly's evasive actions. If the connection is weak  the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course. If the connection is strong  the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn. Now consider a situation in which the motors stay off  the fly continues on its path and it suffers some painful consequence such as getting zapped. In a situation like this  we would expect the Critic to speak up and to tell the Actor to change its policy. We have created such a situation  artificially  by turning on the critic with a flash of light. That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors. So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again  the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver. I don't know about you  but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical  mechanistic understanding of the mind  even if it's the mind of the fly. This is one piece of good news. The other piece of good news  for a scientist at least  is that much remains to be discovered. In the experiments I told you about  we have lifted the identity of the Critic  but we still have no idea how the Critic does its job. Come to think of it  knowing when you're wrong without a teacher  or your mother  telling you  is a very hard problem. There are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done  but we still haven't solved a single example of how intelligent behavior springs from the physical interactions in living matter. I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. Thank you. Well  there's lots to talk about  but I think I'm just going to play to start off.   When I wake up     in the morning     I pour the coffee     I read the paper     And then I slowly     and so softly     do the dishes     So feed the fishes     You sing me happy birthday     Like it's gonna be     your last day     here on Earth   All right. So  I wanted to do something special today. I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months. And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience  especially when it's half finished. I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it. Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms. And so this is basically a song about loops  but not the kind of loops that I make up here. They're feedback loops. And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source  and then it gets in this self destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound. And I'm going to demonstrate for you. I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.   This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a loop  feedback loop     This is a     Feedback  All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate       but my point is it's the sound of self destruction. And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms  from  say  the ecological  okay. There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from  it gets ugly. So like  you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease  and inbreeding and incest and  let's see  what's the other one  Biological    there's autoimmune diseases  where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host  or the person. And then    okay  this is where we get to the song    kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. Because although I've used scientific terms in songs  it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical. And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs. So I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody. And so  I don't know if you've ever had this  but when I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep  I can't stop thinking about my own eyes. And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves. That's what it feels like to me. It's not pleasant. I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head. It's impossible  of course  for your eyes to see themselves  but they seem to be trying. So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience. Or ears being able to hear themselves    it's just impossible. That's the thing. So  I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves  if that's possible. And that's what the song is asking. All right. It doesn't have a name yet.   Go ahead and congratulate yourself     Give yourself a hand  the hand is your hand     And the eye that eyes itself is your eye     And the ear that hears itself is near     'Cause it's your ear  oh oh     You've done the impossible now     Took yourself apart     You made yourself invulnerable     No one can break your heart     So you wear it out     And you wring it out     And you wear it out     And you break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own  break it yourself     Breaking your own   Thanks. All right. It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder. You can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research. But  you know  I think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now  just a little bit. I'm going to finish up with a song of mine called  Weather Systems.    Quiet     Quiet down  she said     Speak into the back of his head     On the edge of the bed  I can see your blood flow     I can see your     cells grow     Hold still awhile     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems     of the world     Weather systems     of the world     Some things you say     are not for sale     I would hold it where     our free agents of some substance are     scared     Hold still a while     Don't spill the wine     I can see it all from here     I can see     oh  I     I can see     weather systems of the world     Weather systems     of the world   Thanks. So this is a story of a place that I now call home. It's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both. So this is Bertie County  North Carolina  USA. To give you an idea of the  where   So here's North Carolina  and if we zoom in  Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state. It's about two hours east driving time from Raleigh. And it's very flat. It's very swampy. It's mostly farmland. The entire county is home to just        people  and they're very sparsely distributed. So there's only    people per square mile  which comes down to about    people per square kilometer. Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America. We've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders. We know the symptoms. It's the hollowing out of small towns. It's downtowns becoming ghost towns. The brain drain    where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back. It's the dependence on farm subsidies and under performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban. And Bertie County is no exception to this. Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with  like many communities similar to it  is that there's no shared  collective investment in the future of rural communities. Only  .  percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities  and yet    percent of our population lives there. So Bertie County is not only very rural  it's incredibly poor. It is the poorest county in the state. It has one in three of its children living in poverty  and it's what is referred to as a  rural ghetto.  The economy is mostly agricultural. The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco  and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut. The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant. The county seat is Windsor. This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now. It's home to only       people  and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years. There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use. You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand    Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite. But in the whole county there is no coffee shop  there's no Internet cafe  there's no movie theater  there's no bookstore. There isn't even a Walmart. Racially  the county is about    percent African American  but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy. So the public school students are about    percent African American. And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class  and you can see the difference is pretty stark. So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement. There's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from  and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher. So there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education. In fact  two years ago  only    percent of all the third  through eighth graders were passing the state standard in both English and math. So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place  but I promise there is good news. The biggest asset  in my opinion  one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man  This is Dr. Chip Zullinger  fondly known as Dr. Z. He was brought in in October      as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system. And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston  South Carolina and then in Denver  Colorado. He started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '  s in the U.S. And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary  and he is the reason that I now live and work there. So in February of       Dr. Zullinger invited us  Project H Design    which is a non profit design firm that I founded    to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district. And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process    one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital. Specifically  we use these six design directives  probably the most important being number two  we design with  not for    in that  when we're doing humanitarian focused design  it's not about designing for clients anymore. It's about designing with people  and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. So at the time of being invited down there  we were based in San Francisco  and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of       spending about half our time in Bertie County. And when I say we  I mean Project H  but more specifically  I mean myself and my partner  Matthew Miller  who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver type builder. So fast forward to today  and we now live there. I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo  because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits. But this is our front porch. We live there. We now call this place home. Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth  we realized we had fallen in love with the place. We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County  that  as designers and builders  you can't do everywhere. There's space to experiment and to weld and to test things. We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger. There's a nobility of real  hands on  dirt under your fingernails work. But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there  there is a huge need. There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County. There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county. And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool  something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have  and to be sort of the    to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit. The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger    that was why we were there. But beyond that  we recognized that Bertie County  as a community  was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking. So the goal became  yes  to apply design within education  but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development. So in order to do this  we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education. And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County  but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond. So the first of the three is design for education. This is the most kind of direct  obvious intersection of the two things. It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students. This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days. And so this played out for us in a couple different ways. The first was a series of renovations of computer labs. So traditionally  the computer labs  particularly in an under performing school like Bertie County  where they have to benchmark test every other week  the computer lab is a kill and drill testing facility. You come in  you face the wall  you take your test and you leave. So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology  to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging  more accessible  and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction. So this is the lab at the high school  and the principal there is in love with this room. Every time he has visitors  it's the first place that he takes them. And this also meant the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape. It allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid. So this game that the kids are playing here    in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me. And in Match Me  you take the class  divide it into two teams  one team on each side of the playground  and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires. And then she'll call out a math problem    so let's say four times four    and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is    and find the tire with the    on it and sit on it. So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins. And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing. Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores  a greater comfort level with the material  especially with the boys  that in going outside and playing  they aren't afraid to take on a double digit multiplication problem    and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material. So with design for education  I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers  so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them. So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent. He came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. So the second approach is redesigning education itself. This is the most complex. It's a systems level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom. So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change  which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside the box education systems in rural communities. So for us  this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie. There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county. And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system. Right now I should say  there are only    percent of the houses that actually have an in home Internet connection. And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings  or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint  which I find myself squatting outside of a lot. Aside from  you know  getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place  it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community. It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development. So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer  and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day. And then the third approach  which is what I'm most excited about  which is where we are now  is  design as education. So  design as education  means that we could actually teach design within public schools  and not design based learning    not like  let's learn physics by building a rocket   but actually learning design thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose. It also means that designers are no longer consultants  but we're teachers  and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation. And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring  rigid  verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by. It's hands on  it's in your face  it requires an active engagement  and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways. So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class    wood and metal shop class in particular    historically  has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college. It's a vocational training path. It's working class  it's blue collar. The projects are things like  let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas. And in recent decades  a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely. So we thought  what if you could bring back shop class  but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed  and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative design thinking studio process. So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class. And so this starts in four weeks  at the end of the summer  and my partner and I  Matthew and I  just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it. And this is what it looks like. So over the course of two semesters  the Fall and the Spring  the students spend three hours a day every single day in our       square foot studio shop space. And during that time  they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need finding  coming back into the studio  doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work  and then moving into the shop and actually testing them  building them  prototyping them  figuring out if they are going to work and refining that. And then over the summer  they're offered a summer job. They're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community. So the first project  which will be built next summer  is an open air farmers' market downtown  followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year. So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say   I built that  and I'm proud of it.  So I want you to meet three of our students. This is Ryan. She is    years old. She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher. She wants to go to college  but she wants to come back to Bertie County  because that's where her family is from  where she calls home  and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in. So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. This is Eric. He plays for the football team. He is really into dirtbike racing  and he wants to be an architect. So for him  Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect  everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client. And then this is Anthony. He is    years old  loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands  and so for him  Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands on engagement. He's interested in forestry  but he isn't sure  so if he ends up not going to college  he will have developed some industry relevant skills. What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom. So this building downtown  which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market  is now the classroom. And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why    that's a homework assignment. And the ribbon cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public    that's the final exam. And for the community  what design and building offers is real  visible  built progress. It's one project per year  and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future. So we recognize that Studio H  especially in its first year  is a small story       students  it's two teachers  it's one project in one place. But we feel like this could work in other places. And I really  strongly believe in the power of the small story  because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale. Because  when you zoom out that far  you lose the ability to view people as humans. Ultimately  design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers. And let's face it  designers  we need to reinvent ourselves. We need to re educate ourselves around the things that matter  we need to work outside of our comfort zones more  and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard. So while this is a very small story  we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design. Thank you. Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war. These are not normally the most cheerful of topics  nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about. Yet  not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago  but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict. Three things stand out  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter  how they matter  and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways  that is  how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last. But let's start at the beginning. Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now  and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat. For nearly two decades now  the news has been bad and the images have been haunting. In Georgia  after years of stalemate  we saw a full scale resurgence of violence in August      . This quickly escalated into a five day war between Russia and Georgia  leaving Georgia ever more divided. In Kenya  contested presidential elections in         we just heard about them    quickly led to high levels of inter ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people. In Sri Lanka  a decades long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in       after perhaps as many as         people had been killed since     . In Kyrgyzstan  just over the last few weeks  unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks. Hundreds have been killed  and more than         displaced  including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan. In the Middle East  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated  and it becomes ever more difficult to see how  just how a possible  sustainable solution can be achieved. Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines  but the killing and displacement there continues as well  and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom. And in Iraq  finally  violence is on the rise again  and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections. But hang on  this talk is to be about the good news. So are these now the images of the past  Well  notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East  Darfur  Iraq  elsewhere  there is a longer term trend that does represent some good news. Over the past two decades  since the end of the Cold War  there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars. Since the high in the early     s  with about    such civil wars ongoing  we now have    percent fewer such conflicts today. The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two. But this trend is less unambiguous. The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between      and       with about        soldiers  policemen and rebels killed every year. The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in       with just        killed. Despite the up and down since then  the overall trend    and this is the important bit    clearly points downward for the past two decades. The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be. From over        civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in      and       a decade later  this figure stands at      . This is a decrease by two thirds. This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in     . But then         civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months. This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed. What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story. They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war  from hunger or disease  for example. And they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally. Torture  rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective  if often non lethal  weapons in civil war. To put it differently  for the civilians that suffer the consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war  there is no good war and there is no bad peace. Thus  even though every civilian killed  maimed  raped  or tortured is one too many  the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago  is good news. So  we have fewer conflicts today in which fewer people get killed. And the big question  of course  is why  In some cases  there is a military victory of one side. This is a solution of sorts  but rarely is it one that comes without human costs or humanitarian consequences. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this  but we have seen similar so called military solutions in the Balkans  in the South Caucasus and across most of Africa. At times  they are complimented by negotiated settlements  or at least cease fire agreements  and peacekeepers are deployed. But hardly ever do they represent a resounding success    Bosnia and Herzegovina perhaps more so than Georgia. But for many parts of Africa  a colleague of mine once put it this way   The cease fire on Tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning.  But let's look at the good news again. If there's no solution on the battlefield  three factors can account for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war  or for sustainable peace afterwards  leadership  diplomacy and institutional design. Take the example of Northern Ireland. Despite centuries of animosity  decades of violence and thousands of people killed       saw the conclusion of an historic agreement. Its initial version was skillfully mediated by Senator George Mitchell. Crucially  for the long term success of the peace process in Northern Ireland  he imposed very clear conditions for the participation and negotiations. Central among them  a commitment to exclusively peaceful means. Subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the British and Irish governments  who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. The core institutions that were put in place in      and their modifications in      and      were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed. The agreement combines a power sharing arrangement in Northern Ireland with cross border institutions that link Belfast and Dublin and thus recognizes the so called Irish dimension of the conflict. And significantly  there's also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities. The provisions in the agreement may be complex  but so is the underlying conflict. Perhaps most importantly  local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise  not always fast and not always enthusiastically  but rise in the end they did. Who ever could have imagined Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness jointly governing Northern Ireland as First and Deputy First Minister  But then  is Northern Ireland a unique example  or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries  By no means. The ending of Liberia's long lasting civil war in      illustrates the importance of leadership  diplomacy and institutional design as much as the successful prevention of a full scale civil war in Macedonia in       or the successful ending of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in     . In all three cases  local leaders were willing and able to make peace  the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement  and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed. Focusing on leadership  diplomacy and institutional design also helps explain failures to achieve peace  or to make it last. The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords did not lead to an end of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Not all the issues that needed to be resolved were actually covered in the agreements. Rather  local leaders committed to revisiting them later on. Yet instead of grasping this opportunity  local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second Intifada  the events of      and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan signed in      turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged  and its provisions may yet bear the seeds of a full scale return to war between north and south. Changes and shortcomings in leadership  more off than on international diplomacy and institutional failures account for this in almost equal measure. Unresolved boundary issues  squabbles over oil revenues  the ongoing conflict in Darfur  escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of Sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in Africa's largest country. A final example  Kosovo. The failure to achieve a negotiated solution for Kosovo and the violence  tension and de facto partition that resulted from it have their reasons in many  many different factors. Central among them are three. First  the intransigence of local leaders to settle for nothing less than their maximum demands. Second  an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by Western support for Kosovo's independence. And third  a lack of imagination when it came to designing institutions that could have addressed the concerns of Serbs and Albanians alike. By the same token    and here we have some good news again    the very fact that there is a high level  well resourced international presence in Kosovo and the Balkans region more generally and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint  explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since     . So even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal  local leaders and international leaders have a choice  and they can make a difference for the better. A cold war is not as good as a cold peace  but a cold peace is still better than a hot war. Good news is also about learning the right lesson. So what then distinguishes the Israeli Palestinian conflict from that in Northern Ireland  or the civil war in Sudan from that in Liberia  Both successes and failures teach us several critically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue. First  leadership. In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war are not natural but man made disasters  their prevention and settlement does not happen automatically either. Leadership needs to be capable  determined and visionary in its commitment to peace. Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers  and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future. Second  diplomacy. Diplomacy needs to be well resourced  sustained  and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers. It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise  and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local  regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement. Third  institutional design. Institutional design requires a keen focus on issues  innovative thinking and flexible and well funded implementation. Conflict parties need to move away from maximum demands and towards a compromise that recognizes each other's needs. And they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them. Conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls. For me personally  the most critical lesson of all is this  Local commitment to peace is all important  but it is often not enough to prevent or end violence. Yet  no amount of diplomacy or institutional design can make up for local failures and the consequences that they have. Therefore  we must invest in developing leaders  leaders that have the skills  vision and determination to make peace. Leaders  in other words  that people will trust and that they will want to follow even if that means making hard choices. A final thought  Ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers  frustrations and setbacks. It often takes a generation to accomplish  but it also requires us  today's generation  to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership  diplomacy and institutional design  so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow. Thank you. I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota. Many of you may have heard of the Lakota  or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux. The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations. The Pine Ridge Reservation  the subject of today's slide show  is located about    miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota. It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number      and it is where the Lakota now live. Now  if any of you have ever heard of AIM  the American Indian Movement  or of Russell Means  or Leonard Peltier  or of the stand off at Oglala  then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S. So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota  and that's a very difficult one for me. Because  if you haven't noticed from my skin color  I'm white  and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation. You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today  and I've become very close with them  and they've welcomed me like family. They've called me  brother  and  uncle  and invited me again and again over five years. But on Pine Ridge  I will always be what is called  wasichu   and  wasichu  is a Lakota word that means  non Indian   but another version of this word means  the one who takes the best meat for himself.  And that's what I want to focus on    the one who takes the best part of the meat. It means greedy. So take a look around this auditorium today. We are at a private school in the American West  sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets. And if we look at our lives  we have indeed taken the best part of the meat. So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain  and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota  they stand for all indigenous people. On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family. The following is a time line of treaties made  treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles. I'll begin in     . What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department  setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.       The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made  clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation. According to the treaty  those lands are a sovereign nation. If the boundaries of this treaty had held    and there is a legal basis that they should    then this is what the U.S. would look like today.    years later  the Homestead Act  signed by President Lincoln  unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.       An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of    Sioux men  the largest mass execution in U.S. history. The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.       the beginning of the transcontinental railroad    a new era. We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation. The treaties were out the window. In response  three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S. army many times over. I want to repeat that part. The Lakota defeat the U.S. army.       The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills. The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states. We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites. The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux. In fact  this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.       The transcontinental railroad was completed. It began carrying  among other things  a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo  eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.       The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government. In addition  the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations. All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war. Also in       we ended the time of treaty making. The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations  and we can't have that. We had plans.       General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory  specifically the Black Hills. The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation. Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.       The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.       On July   th on its way to attack a Lakota village  Custer's  th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn.       The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson. He was later killed while in custody.      is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties. A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as  sell or starve   Sign the paper  or no food for your tribe. Only    percent of the adult male population signed. The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three quarters of the tribe to sign away land. That clause was obviously ignored.       The Dawes Act. Communal ownership of reservation lands ends. Reservations are cut up into     acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of. Tribes lost millions of acres. The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left. The move destroyed the reservations  making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation. Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers. Once again  the fat of the land goes to wasichu.       a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show. This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre. On December   th  U.S. troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and     prisoners of war  using a new rapid fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun. For this so called  battle      Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the  th Cavalry. To this day  this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle. More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One  World War Two  Korea  Vietnam  Iraq or Afghanistan. The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars. Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee  I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux  but as a grave for all indigenous peoples. The holy man  Black Elk  said   I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now from this high hill of my old age  I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard  A people's dream died there  and it was a beautiful dream.  With this event  a new era in Native American history began. Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after. Because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the U.S. government openly declared its position on Native rights. They were tired of treaties. They were tired of sacred hills. They were tired of ghost dances. And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux. So they brought out their cannons.  You want to be an Indian now   they said  finger on the trigger.       the U.S. Indian population reached its low point    less than          compared to an estimated eight million in     . Fast forward.       The longest running court case in U.S. history  the Sioux Nation v. the United States  was ruled upon by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court determined that  when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders  the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated. The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation. As payment for the Black Hills  the court awarded only     million dollars to the Sioux Nation. The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry   The Black Hills are not for sale.        Statistics about Native population today  more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee  reveal the legacy of colonization  forced migration and treaty violations. Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between    and    percent. The housing office is unable to build new structures  and existing structures are falling apart. Many are homeless  and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families.    percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity. At least    percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold. More than    percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line. The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U.S. national average. The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the U.S. national average. Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S. national average. School dropout rate is up to    percent. Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U.S. national average. Frequently  grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents  due to alcoholism  domestic violence and general apathy  cannot raise them.    percent of the population over the age of    suffers from diabetes. The life expectancy for men is between    and    years old    roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia. The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say   My God  what are these people doing to themselves  They're killing each other. They're killing themselves while we watch them die.  This is how we came to own these United States. This is the legacy of manifest destiny. Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps long after the guards are gone. These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken. A long time ago  a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me  by wasichu  eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills. Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end. As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in       or a series of broken treaties     years ago  I still have to ask you the question  how should you feel about the statistics of today  What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you  And how much of this history do you need to own  even  Is any of this your responsibility today  I have been told that there must be something we can do. There must be some call to action. Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness  just taking photographs. Because the solution seems so far in the past  I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them. The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix. It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti  or ending AIDS  or fighting a famine. The  fix   as it's called  may be much more difficult for the dominant society than  say  a     check or a church trip to paint some graffiti covered houses  or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore. So where does that leave us  Shrugging our shoulders in the dark  The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the      and      Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota. The call to action I offer today    my TED wish    is this  Honor the treaties. Give back the Black Hills. It's not your business what they do with them. This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo. It's mined by armed gangs using slaves  child slaves  what the U.N. Security Council calls  blood minerals   then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China. That factory    over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year. One man died after working a    hour shift. We all love chocolate. We buy it for our kids. Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children. Cote d'Ivoire  we have a huge problem of child slaves. Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations. Heparin    a blood thinner  a pharmaceutical product    starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China  because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines. Your diamond    you've all heard  probably seen the movie  Blood Diamond.  This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now. Cotton  Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth. Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest  the government shuts down the schools  puts the kids in buses  buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton. It's forced child labor on an institutional scale. And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila. These places  these origins  represent governance gaps. That's the politest description I have for them. These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin    the global supply chains  which bring us our favorite brand name products. Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states. Some of them are not states anymore at all. They're failed states. Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment  promote trade. Either way  they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma. I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain. But right now  most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future  nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product. Now  I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain. We need a reality check. We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have. This is an independent republic  probably a failed state. It's definitely not a democratic state. And right now  that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us  that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption. Now  that's not a new story. You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world  even in developed countries. You want to see the classic sweatshop  meet me at Madison Square Garden  I'll take you down the street  and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. But take the example of heparin. It's a pharmaceutical product. You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital  probably squeaky clean. The problem is that the active ingredient in there    as I mentioned earlier    comes from pigs. The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs. And their factory in China    which probably is pretty clean    is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs  where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient. So a couple of years ago  we had a scandal which killed about    people around the world  because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain. Worse  some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests. This substitute cost nine dollars a pound  whereas real heparin  the real ingredient  cost     dollars a pound. A no brainer. The problem was that it killed more people. And so you're asking yourself   How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen  How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen   And the answer is quite simple  the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities  not pharmaceutical facilities  so they don't audit them. And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem. This is offshore. They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas    about a dozen a year    maybe    in a good year. There are     of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone. In fact  about    percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore  particularly China and India  and we don't have a governance system. We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe. We don't have a system to ensure that human rights  basic dignity  are ensured. So at a national level    and we work in about    different countries    at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil. And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational. So governments who are failing  who are dropping the ball at a national level  have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level. And you can just look at the headlines. Take Copenhagen last year    complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge. Take the G   meeting a couple of weeks ago    stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago. You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself  where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions  responses  to those international problems  And the simple answer is they can't. They're national. Their voters are local. They have parochial interests. They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good. So  if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level    in this case  in the global supply chain    we have to come up with a different mechanism. We need a different machine. Fortunately  we have some examples. In the     s  there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S.    child labor  forced labor  serious health and safety abuses. And eventually President Clinton  in       convened a meeting at the White House  invited industry  human rights NGOs  trade unions  the Department of Labor  got them all in a room and said   Look  I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom. I don't know how to prevent that  but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response.  So they formed a White House task force  and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain. Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility. They don't own those facilities. They don't employ those workers. They're not legally liable. Everybody else at the table said   Folks  that doesn't cut it. You have a custodial duty  a duty of care  to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it  without fear of our safety  or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product.  So they agreed   Okay  what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards  code of conduct. We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control. We'll make it part of the contract.  And that was a stroke of absolute genius  because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract  private power  to deliver public goods. And let's face it  the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law  the local environmental regulations  the local human rights standards. Those factories will probably never see an inspector. If the inspector did come along  it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe. Even if they did their jobs  and they cited those facilities for their violations  the fine would be derisory. But you lose that contract for a major brand name  that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt. That makes a difference. So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain  that of the multinational company  and get them to do the right thing  get them to use that power for good  to deliver the key public goods. Now of course  this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies. They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money. But they are extremely efficient organizations. They have resources  and if we can add the will  the commitment  they know how to deliver that product. Now  getting there is not easy. Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier  they're not there. You need a safe space. You need a place where people can come together  sit down without fear of judgment  without recrimination  to actually face the problem  agree on the problem and come up with solutions. We can do it. The technical solutions are there. The problem is the lack of trust  the lack of confidence  the lack of partnership between NGOs  campaign groups  civil society organizations and multinational companies. If we can put those two together in a safe space  get them to work together  we can deliver public goods right now  or in extremely short supply. This is a radical proposition  and it's crazy to think that if you're a    year old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka               dollars a month    your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract. It's crazy. Multinationals are protecting human rights. I know there's going to be disbelief. You'll say   How can we trust them   Well  we don't. It's the old arms control phrase   Trust  but verify.  So we audit. We take their supply chain  we take all the factory names  we do a random sample  we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities  and then we publish the results. Transparency is absolutely critical to this. You can call yourself responsible  but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work. So what we're doing is  we're not only enlisting the multinationals  we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good    respect for human rights    and we're checking. You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me. Go to the website. Look at the audit results. Ask yourself  is this company behaving in a socially responsible way  Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics  That's the way the system works. I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world. I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs. I've been at this for    years  and in that time I've seen the ability  the commitment  the will of government to do this decline  and I don't see them making a comeback right now. So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure. We're now thinking that  in fact  this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges. Call it network governance. Call it what you will. The private actors  companies and NGOs  are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face. Just look at pandemics    swine flu  bird flu  H N . Look at the health systems in so many countries. Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic  No. Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response  Absolutely. What they lack is that safe space to come together  agree and move to action. That's what we're trying to provide. I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume.  You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain. There are thousands of suppliers in there.  It seems too daunting  too dangerous  for any company to take on. But there are companies. We have       companies who are members. Some of them are very  very large companies. The sporting goods industry  in particular  stepped up to the plate and have done it. The example  the role model  is there. And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address    child labor in cottonseed farms in India    this year we will monitor        cottonseed farms in India. It seems overwhelming. The numbers just make you want to zone out. But we break it down to some basic realities. And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition  can I give this person their dignity back  Poor people  people whose human rights have been violated    the crux of that is the loss of dignity  the lack of dignity. It starts with just giving people back their dignity. I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi  one of the flashiest  brightest new cities popping up in India right now  and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road  and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands. They didn't say money. They said   The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human  like we don't exist. Please ask them to treat us like human beings.  That's my simple understanding of human rights. That's my simple proposition to you  my simple plea to every decision maker in this room  everybody out there. We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped. If we don't do it  we're abandoning hope  we're abandoning our essential humanity  and I know that's not a place we want to be  and we don't have to be there. So I appeal to you. Join us  come into that safe space  and let's start to make this happen. Thank you very much. Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem  Well  I hope to change that in less than three minutes. So  I hope to convince you that complex doesn't always equal complicated. So for me  a well crafted baguette  fresh out of the oven  is complex  but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. I'm an ecologist  and I study complexity. I love complexity. And I study that in the natural world  the interconnectedness of species. So here's a food web  or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non native fish that never lived there before. All the grayed out species disappear. Some are actually on the brink of extinction. And lakes with fish have more mosquitos  even though they eat them. These effects were all unanticipated  and yet we're discovering they're predictable. So I want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems. First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. For example  you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem  or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. The next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another  if you focus only on that link  and then you black box the rest  it's actually less predictable than if you step back  consider the entire system    all the species  all the links    and from that place  hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. And we're discovering  with our research  that's often very local to the node you care about within one or two degrees. So the more you step back  embrace complexity  the better chance you have of finding simple answers  and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the U.S. government. This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. Instantly ridiculed by the media for being so crazy complicated. And the stated goal was to increase popular support for the Afghan government. Clearly a complex problem  but is it complicated  Well  when I saw this in the front page of the Times  I thought   Great. Finally something I can relate to. I can sink my teeth into this.  So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever  a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. The circled node is the one we're trying to influence    popular support for the government. And so now we can look one degrees  two degrees  three degrees away from that node and eliminate three quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. Within that sphere  most of those nodes are not actionable  like the harshness of the terrain  and a very small minority are actual military actions. Most are non violent and they fall into two broad categories  active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair  transparent economic development and provisioning of services. I don't know about this  but this is what I can decipher from this diagram in    seconds. When you see a diagram like this  I don't want you to be afraid. I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. Because simple answers may emerge. We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity. So for any problem  the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity  the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. Thank you. We've got a real problem with math education right now. Basically  no one's very happy. Those learning it think it's disconnected  uninteresting and hard. Those trying to employ them think they don't know enough. Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies  but don't know how to fix it. And teachers are also frustrated. Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history. So at one end we've got falling interest in education in math  and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world  a more quantitative world than we ever have had. So what's the problem  why has this chasm opened up  and what can we do to fix it  Well actually  I think the answer is staring us right in the face  Use computers. I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work. So to explain that  let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education. See  in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians. It's done by geologists  engineers  biologists  all sorts of different people    modeling and simulation. It's actually very popular. But in education it looks very different    dumbed down problems  lots of calculating  mostly by hand. Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world  except if you're learning it. And another thing about math  math sometimes looks like math    like in this example here    and sometimes it doesn't    like  Am I drunk   And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world. You wouldn't have expected that a few years back. But now you can find out all about    unfortunately  my weight is a little higher than that  but    all about what happens. So let's zoom out a bit and ask  why are we teaching people math  What's the point of teaching people math  And in particular  why are we teaching them math in general  Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject  Well  I think there are about three reasons  technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies  what I call  everyday living     to function in the world today  you've got to be pretty quantitative  much more so than a few years ago  figure out your mortgages  being skeptical of government statistics  those kinds of things    and thirdly  what I would call something like logical mind training  logical thinking. Over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society. It's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that. So let's ask another question. What is math  What do we mean when we say we're doing math  or educating people to do math  Well  I think it's about four steps  roughly speaking  starting with posing the right question. What is it that we want to ask  What is it we're trying to find out here  And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world  beyond virtually any other part of doing math. People ask the wrong question  and surprisingly enough  they get the wrong answer  for that reason  if not for others. So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem. That's stage two. Once you've done that  then there's the computation step. Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form. And of course  math is very powerful at doing that. And then finally  turn it back to the real world. Did it answer the question  And also verify it    crucial step. Now here's the crazy thing right now. In math education  we're spending about perhaps    percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand. Yet  that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice. Instead  we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one  two and four    conceptualizing problems  applying them  getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. See  crucial point here  math is not equal to calculating. Math is a much broader subject than calculating. Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years. There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand. But in the last few decades that has totally changed. We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers. Calculating was typically the limiting step  and now often it isn't. So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating. But that math liberation didn't get into education yet. See  I think of calculating  in a sense  as the machinery of math. It's the chore. It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can  like to get a machine to do. It's a means to an end  not an end in itself  and automation allows us to have that machinery. Computers allow us to do that    and this is not a small problem by any means. I estimated that  just today  across the world  we spent about     average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand. That's an amazing amount of human endeavor. So we better be damn sure    and by the way  they didn't even have fun doing it  most of them    so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose. I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that. And I think there are some cases. For example  mental arithmetic. I still do a lot of that  mainly for estimating. People say   Is such and such true   And I'll say   Hmm  not sure.  I'll think about it roughly. It's still quicker to do that and more practical. So I think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand. And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating  but I think they're relatively small in number. One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates. See  the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics. It's a major subject. I'm not for one minute suggesting that  if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre    they should do that. That's absolutely the right thing  for people to follow their self interest. I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek  but I don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek. I don't think it's warranted. So I have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that  in a sense  people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. So what are the issues people bring up with this  Well one of them is  they say  you need to get the basics first. You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject. So my usual question is  what do you mean by  basics   Basics of what  Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it  or design it for that matter  Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill  I don't think so. I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation. A hundred years ago  it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things. But automation in cars allowed that to separate  so driving is now a quite separate subject  so to speak  from engineering of the car or learning how to service it. So automation allows this separation and also allows    in the case of driving  and I believe also in the future case of maths    a democratized way of doing that. It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that. So there's another thing that comes up with basics. People confuse  in my view  the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching. So just because paper was invented before computers  it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics. My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this. She enjoys making what she calls  paper laptops.  So I asked her one day   You know  when I was your age  I didn't make these. Why do you think that was   And after a second or two  carefully reflecting  she said   No paper   If you were born after computers and paper  it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in  you just want to have the best tool. So another one that comes up is  Computers dumb math down.  That somehow  if you use a computer  it's all mindless button pushing  but if you do it by hand  it's all intellectual. This one kind of annoys me  I must say. Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand  for reasons they don't get  I don't think so. And what's worse  what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore. Might have been    years ago  but it isn't anymore. When they're out of education  they do it on a computer. Just to be clear  I think computers can really help with this problem  actually make it more conceptual. Now  of course  like any great tool  they can be used completely mindlessly  like turning everything into a multimedia show  like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand  where the computer was the teacher    show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand. This is just nuts. Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway  All backwards. Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate. See  normally in school  you do things like solve quadratic equations. But you see  when you're using a computer  you can just substitute. You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder  calculating wise. Same principles applied    calculations  harder. And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this. They've got hair all over them. They're not just simple  dumbed down things that we see in school math. And think of the outside world. Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers  I don't think so    quite the opposite. So the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down  but that we have dumbed down problems right now. Well  another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding. So if you go through lots of examples  you can get the answer  you can understand how the basics of the system work better. I think there is one thing that I think very valid here  which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important. But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world. It's called programming. Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days  and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand. If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it. So programming is the way I think we should be doing that. So to be clear  what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual  simultaneously. I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible. It's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual. But I think we can do both at the same time here. And we open up so many more possibilities. You can do so many more problems. What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before. And experience of harder problems    being able to play with the math  interact with it  feel it. We want people who can feel the math instinctively. That's what computers allow us to do. Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum. Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate  but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts  however hard the calculating. So calculus has traditionally been taught very late. Why is this  Well  it's damn hard doing the calculations  that's the problem. But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group. This was an example I built for my daughter. And very  very simple. We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number. And of course  it turns into a circle. And by the way  she was also very insistent on being able to change the color  an important feature for this demonstration. You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme    and very small sides and a very large number of sides. Very simple example. That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many  many years after this. And yet  that's a really important practical view of the world. So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams. In the end  if we test everyone by hand in exams  it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters. And one of the reasons it's so important    so it's very important to get computers in exams. And then we can ask questions  real questions  questions like  what's the best life insurance policy to get     real questions that people have in their everyday lives. And you see  this isn't some dumbed down model here. This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens. How many years of protection do I need  What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth  Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams  but I think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding. So I believe  there is  critical reform we have to do in computer based math. We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward  and also our societies  based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics. This isn't some optional extra. And the country that does this first will  in my view  leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even  an improved economy  an improved outlook. In fact  I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the  knowledge economy  to what we might call a  computational knowledge economy   where high level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is. We can engage so many more students with this  and they can have a better time doing it. And let's understand  this is not an incremental sort of change. We're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real world math. And you know if you walk across a chasm  you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all    bigger disaster. No  what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off  we should increase our velocity so it's high  and we should leap off one side and go the other    of course  having calculated our differential equation very carefully. So I want to see a completely renewed  changed math curriculum built from the ground up  based on computers being there  computers that are now ubiquitous almost. Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years. Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math  but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future. Let's go for it  and while we're about it  let's have a bit of fun  for us  for the students and for TED here. Thanks. Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart  which is beauty. I do the philosophy of art  aesthetics  actually  for a living. I try to figure out intellectually  philosophically  psychologically  what the experience of beauty is  what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it. Now this is an extremely complicated subject  in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different. I mean just think of the sheer variety    a baby's face  Berlioz's  Harold in Italy   movies like  The Wizard of Oz  or the plays of Chekhov  a central California landscape  a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji   Der Rosenkavalier   a stunning match winning goal in a World Cup soccer match  Van Gogh's  Starry Night   a Jane Austen novel  Fred Astaire dancing across the screen. This brief list includes human beings  natural landforms  works of art and skilled human actions. An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy. I can  however  give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have. And we get it not from a philosopher of art  not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic. No  this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding  and you know who I mean  Charles Darwin. Of course  a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question   What is beauty   It's in the eye of the beholder. It's whatever moves you personally. Or  as some people  especially academics prefer  beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder. People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste. Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease. Beethoven is adored in Japan. Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints. Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums  while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth. Or just think about American jazz or American movies    they go everywhere. There are many differences among the arts  but there are also universal  cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values. How can we explain this universality  The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes. We need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric  largely pleistocene environments  where we became fully human  but also by the social situations in which we evolved. This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory. I mean fossils  cave paintings and so forth. And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the   th and the   th centuries. Now  I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty  with its emotional intensity and pleasure  belongs to our evolved human psychology. The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations. Beauty is an adaptive effect  which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment. As many of you will know  evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms. The first of these is natural selection    that's random mutation and selective retention    along with our basic anatomy and physiology    the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails. Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions  such as the horrid smell of rotting meat  or fears  such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff. Natural selection also explains pleasures    sexual pleasure  our liking for sweet  fat and proteins  which in turn explains a lot of popular foods  from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs. The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection  and it operates very differently. The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this. It did not evolve for natural survival. In fact  it goes against natural survival. No  the peacock's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens. It's quite a familiar story. It's women who actually push history forward. Darwin himself  by the way  had no doubts that the peacock's tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen. He actually used that word. Now  keeping these ideas firmly in mind  we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination  even obsession  in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction. Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance  so to speak. I mean  you can't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape. It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover. So evolution's trick is to make them beautiful  to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure  the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes. People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape  a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved. This landscape shows up today on calendars  on postcards  in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand. It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees. The trees  by the way  are often preferred if they fork near the ground  that is to say  if they're trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix. The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view  or evidence of water in a bluish distance  indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally    get this    a path or a road  perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline  that extends into the distance  almost inviting you to follow it. This landscape type is regarded as beautiful  even by people in countries that don't have it. The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience. But  someone might argue  that's natural beauty. How about artistic beauty  Isn't that exhaustively cultural  No  I don't think it is. And once again  I'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it. It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet. Chauvet caves are about        years old  along with a few small  realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period. But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that. Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair  as well as ochre body paint  have been found from around         years ago. But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this. I have in mind the so called Acheulian hand axes. The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa. They go back about two and a half million years. These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries  until around  .  million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single  thin stone blades  sometimes rounded ovals  but often in what are to our eyes an arresting  symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form. These Acheulian hand axes    they're named after St. Acheul in France  where finds were made in   th century    have been unearthed in their thousands  scattered across Asia  Europe and Africa  almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed. Now  the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can't have been made for butchering animals. And the plot really thickens when you realize that  unlike other pleistocene tools  the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges. And some  in any event  are too big to use for butchery. Their symmetry  their attractive materials and  above all  their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes  even today. So what were these ancient    I mean  they're ancient  they're foreign  but they're at the same time somehow familiar. What were these artifacts for  The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art  practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects  contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship. Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history    tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call  fitness signals     that is to say  displays that are performances like the peacock's tail  except that  unlike hair and feathers  the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted. Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities    intelligence  fine motor control  planning ability  conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials. Over tens of thousands of generations  such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable. You know  it's an old line  but it has been shown to work     Why don't you come up to my cave  so I can show you my hand axes   Except  of course  what's interesting about this is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed  because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language. It's hard to grasp  but it's an incredible fact. This object was made by a hominid ancestor  Homo erectus or Homo ergaster  between        and         years before language. Stretching over a million years  the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto human history. By the end of the hand axe epic  Homo sapiens    as they were then called  finally    were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by  who knows  telling jokes  storytelling  dancing  or hairstyling. Yes  hairstyling    I insist on that. For us moderns  virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies  to express intense emotions with music  painting and dance. But still  one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings  the beauty we find in skilled performances. From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall  human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts. We find beauty in something done well. So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone  don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful. Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it  even before they could put their love into words. Is beauty in the eye of the beholder  No  it's deep in our minds. It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors. Our powerful reaction to images  to the expression of emotion in art  to the beauty of music  to the night sky  will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists. Thank you. Mountain biking in Israel is something that I do with great passion and commitment. And when I'm on my bike  I feel that I connect with the profound beauty of Israel  and I feel that I'm united with this country's history and biblical law. And also  for me  biking is a matter of empowerment. When I reach the summit of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere  I feel young  invincible  eternal. It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself. You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture  looking at me with some concern. And here is another picture of them. Unfortunately  I cannot show their faces  neither can I disclose their true names  and that's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates  offenders spending time in a correction facility about    minutes' ride from here    well  like everything in Israel. And I've been riding with these kids once a week  every Tuesday  rain or shine  for the last four years and by now  they've become a very big part of my life. This story began four years ago. The correction facility where they are locked up happens to be right in the middle of one of my usual trips  and it's surrounded by barbed wires and electric gates and armed guards. So on one of these rides  I talked my way into the compound and went to see the warden. I told the warden that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically I wanted to take the kids from here to there. And I told him   Let's find a way in which I'll be able to take out    kids once a week to ride with in the summer in the country.  And the warden was quite amused  and he told me he thought that I was a nut and he told me   This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders. They are supposed to be locked up. They aren't supposed to be out at large.  And yet  we began to talk about it  and one thing led to another. And I can't see myself going into a state prison in New Jersey and making such a proposition  but this being Israel  the warden somehow made it happen. And so two months later  we found ourselves  at large     myself     juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named Russ  who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project. And in the next few weeks  I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom  a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these    everything you see here is obviously in Israel    as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes  colors  shapes  forms and so on. In spite of all this splendor  the beginning was extremely frustrating. Every small obstacle  every slight uphill  would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up. So we had a lot of this going on. I found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties    not because they were physically unfit. But that's one reason why they ended up where they were. And I became increasingly more and more agitated  because I was there not only to be with them  but also to ride and create a team and I didn't know what to do. Now  let me give you an example. We're going downhill in some rocky terrain  and the front tire of Alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here. So he crashes down  and he gets slightly injured  but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike and curse violently. Then he throws his helmet in the air. His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction. And then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and curse like I've never heard. And I'm just standing there  watching this scene with a complete disbelief  not knowing what to do. I'm used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students  and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging  violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere. And you have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations. They happened in places like this  in the Judean Desert     kilometers away from the nearest road. And what you don't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there  there's a teenager sitting on a rock  saying   I'm not moving from here. Forget it. I've had it.  Well  that's a problem because one way or another  you have to get this guy moving because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do. At the beginning  it was a disaster. I tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere. That's what they had all their lives. And at some point I found out  when a kid like this gets into a fit  the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid  which is difficult  because what you really want to do is go away. But that's what he had all his life  people walking away from him. So what you have to do is stay close and try to reach in and pet his shoulder or give him a piece of chocolate. So I would say   Alex  I know that it's terribly difficult. Why don't you rest for a few minutes and then we'll go on.   Go away you maniac psychopath. Why would you bring us to this goddamn place   And I would say   Relax  Alex. Here's a piece of chocolate.  And Alex would go   Arrrrggg   Because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry    and after the rides also. And who is this guy  Alex  to begin with  He's a    year old. When he was eight  someone put him on a boat in Odessa and sent him  shipped him to Israel on his own. And he ended up in south Tel Aviv and did not have the good luck to be picked up by a  unclear  and roamed the streets and became a prominent gang member. And he spent the last    years of his life in two places only  the slums and the state prison  where he spent the last two years before he ended up sitting on this rock there. And so this kid was probably abused  abandoned  ignored  betrayed by almost every adult along the way. So  for such a kid  when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation  irrespective of how he behaves  it's a tremendous healing experience. It's an act of unconditional acceptance  something that he never had. I want to say a few words about vision. When I started this program four years ago  I had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs. I had an image of Lance Armstrong in my mind. And it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced  and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available. It all of a sudden dawned on me  in this project  that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids to one thing only  love. Love to the country  to the uphill and the downhill  to all the incredible creatures that surround us    the animals  the plants  the insects    love and respect to other fellow members in your team  in your biking team  and most importantly  love and respect to yourself  which is something that they badly miss. Together with the kids  I also went through a remarkable transformation. Now  I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology. I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen. And before I worked with the kids  anything that I did with them  or anything that I did with myself  was supposed to be perfect  ideal  optimal  but after working with them for some time  I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision  and if the vision doesn't work  well nothing happened. All you have to do is play with it  change it a little bit  and come up with something that does help  that does work. So right now  I feel more like these are my principles  and if you don't like them  I have others. And one of these principles is focus. Before each ride we sit together with the kids  and we give them one word to think about during the ride. You have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen. So these are words like  teamwork  or  endurance  or even complicated concepts like  resource allocation  or  perspective   a word that they don't understand. You know  perspective is one of these critically important life coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you. I tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore  it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows. It literally propels you upwards. That's what perspective is all about. Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before. And that's how they develop self esteem. Now  let me give you an example of how it works. You stand with your bike at the beginning of February. It's very cold  and you're standing in one of these rainy days  and it's drizzling and cold and chilly  and you're standing in  let's say  Yokneam. And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka    that's where you're supposed to climb now    and you say   There's no way that I could possibly get there.  And yet  two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery  smeared with mud  blood and sweat. And you look down at Yokneam  everything is so small and tiny. And you say   Hey  Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started. It's that big. I can't believe that I did it.  And that's the point when you start loving yourself. And so we talked about these special words that we teach them. And at the end of each ride  we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference  and these discussions can be extremely inspiring. In one of them  one of the kids once said   When we were riding on this ridge overlooking the Dead Sea    and he's talking about this spot here     I was reminded of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia and went away together with my brother. We walked     kilometers until we reached Sudan. This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.  And he goes on saying  and everyone looks at him like a hero  probably for the first time in his life. And he says    because I also have volunteers riding with me  adults  who are sitting there listening to him    and he says   And this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in Israel. And only now   he says   I'm beginning to understand where I am  and I actually like it.  Now I remember  when he said it  I felt goosebumps on my body  because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background. That's where Joshua descended and crossed the Jordan and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan       years ago in this final leg of the journey from Africa. And so  perspective and context and history play key roles in the way I plan my rides with the kids. We visit Kibbutzim that were established by Holocaust survivors. We explore ruins of Palestinian villages  and we discuss how they became ruins. And we go through numerous remnants of Jewish settlements  Nabatic settlements  Canaanite settlements    three   four  five thousand years old. And through this tapestry  which is the history of this country  the kids acquire what is probably the most important value in education  and that is the understanding that life is complex  and there's no black and white. And by appreciating complexity  they become more tolerant  and tolerance leads to hope. I ride with these kids once a week  every Tuesday. Here's a picture I took last Tuesday    less than a week ago    and I ride with them tomorrow also. In every one of these rides I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations  taking in this incredible landscape around me  and I feel blessed and fortunate that I'm alive  and that I sense every fiber in my aching body. And I feel blessed and fortunate that    years ago I had the courage to resign my tenured position at NYU and return to my home country where I can do these incredible rides with this group of troubled kids coming from Ethiopia and Morocco and Russia. And I feel blessed and fortunate that every week  every Tuesday    and actually every Friday also    I can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. Thank you. I grew up in a very small village in Canada  and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic. I had a really hard time in school. In fact  my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school. I ran away. I left when I was    years old to go to Bali  and there I met my incredible wife  Cynthia  and together  over    years  we built an amazing jewelry business. It was a fairy tale  and then we retired. Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see. It ruined my life     The Inconvenient Truth  and Mr. Gore. I have four kids  and even if part of what he says is true  they're not going to have the life that I had. And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities. So here's the world  and here we are in Bali. It's a tiny  little island       miles by    miles. It has an intact Hindu culture. Cynthia and I were there. We had had a wonderful life there  and we decided to do something unusual. We decided to give back locally. And here it is  it's called the Green School. I know it doesn't look like a school  but it is something we decided to do  and it is extremely  extremely green. The classrooms have no walls. The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard. The desks are not square. At Green School  the children are smiling    an unusual thing for school  especially for me. And we practice holism. And for me it's just the idea that  if this little girl graduates as a whole person  chances are she'll demand a whole world    a whole world    to live on. Our children spend     days going to school in a box. The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials. So if this gentleman had had a holistic education  would he be sitting there  Would he have had more possibilities in his life  The classrooms have natural light. They're beautiful. They're bamboo. The breeze passes through them. And when the natural breeze isn't enough  the kids deploy bubbles  but not the kind of bubbles you know. These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree. So we basically turned the box into a bubble. And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future. We pay the bill at the end of the month  but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren. We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible. These kids did a little graffiti on their desks  and then they signed up for two extra courses. The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re waxing. But since that happened  they own those desks. They know they can control their world. We're on the grid. We're not proud of it. But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar. And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world  in a two and a half meter drop on a river. When the turbine drops in  it will produce       watts of electricity  day and night. And you know what these are. There's nowhere to flush. And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water    you're all really smart  just do the math. How many people times how much water. There isn't enough water. These are compost toilets  and nobody at the school wanted to know about them  especially the principal. And they work. People use them. People are okay. It's something you should think about doing. Not many things didn't work. The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months. We had to replace them with recyclable plastic. The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms. So we had some good ideas  we took old automobile windshields  put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard. Green School sits in south central Bali  and it's on    acres of rolling garden. There's an amazing river traveling through it  and you can see there how we manage to get across the river. I met a father the other day  he looked a little crazed. I said   Welcome to Green School.  He said   I've been on an airplane for    hours.  I asked him   Why   He said   I had a dream once about a green school  and I saw a picture of this green school  I got on an airplane. In August I'm bringing my sons.  This was a great thing. But more than that  people are building green houses around Green School  so their kids can walk to school on the paths. And people are bringing their green industries  hopefully their green restaurants  to the Green School. It's becoming a community. It's becoming a green model. We had to look at everything. No petrochemicals in the pavement. No pavement. These are volcanic stones laid by hand. There are no sidewalks. The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains  but they're green. This is the school buffalo. He's planning to eat that fence for dinner. All the fences at Green School are green. And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate  they found out the fence was made out of tapioca. They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen  sliced them thinly and made delicious chips. Landscaping. We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms. We dropped them gently in. We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs. And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field. These young ladies are living in a rice culture  but they know something that few people know in a rice culture. They know how to plant organic rice  they know how to look after it  they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it. They're part of the rice cycle and these skills will be valuable for them in their future. This young man is picking organic vegetables. We feed     people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas. Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know. The food is incredible. Green School is a place of pioneers  local and global. And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world. The kids are from    countries. When I see them together  I know that they're working out how to live in the future. Green School is going into its third year with     children. It's a school where you do learn reading    one of my favorites    writing    I was bad at it    arithmetic. But you also learn other things. You learn bamboo building. You practice ancient Balinese arts. This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields. The kids love it. The mothers aren't quite convinced. We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives  and we said  okay  local  what does  local  mean  Local means that    percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese  and this was a really big commitment. And we were right. And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund  because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders. The teachers are as diverse as the student body  and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up. A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture. A woman came from Africa with music. And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global  green leaders. The Green School effect    we don't know what it is. We need someone to come and study it. But what's happening  our learning different kids    dyslexic    we've renamed them prolexic    are doing well in these beautiful  beautiful classrooms. And all the kids are thriving. And how did we do all this  On giant grass. It's bamboo. It comes out of the ground like a train. It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this. It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof. When the architects came  they brought us these things  and you've probably seen things like this. The yellow box was called the administration complex. We squashed it  we rethought it  but mainly we renamed it  the heart of school   and that changed everything forever. It's a double helix. It has administrators in it and many  many other things. And the problem of building it    when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans  they looked at them and said   What's this   So we built big models. We had them engineered by the engineers. And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers  selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age old techniques  mostly by hand. It was chaos. And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do  so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down  we realized that we had a cathedral  a cathedral to green  and a cathedral to green education. The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it. From the time the foundations were finished  in three months it had roofs and floors. It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world  but many people believe that it's the most beautiful. Is this doable in your community  We believe it is. Green School is a model we built for the world. It's a model we built for Bali. And you just have to follow these simple  simple rules  be local  let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build. So  Mr. Gore  thank you. You ruined my life  but you gave me an incredible future. And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next    around the world  please come and see us. Thank you. Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep  so dark  so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon. It's a place of myth and legend. It's a place marked on ancient maps as  here be monsters.  It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed. Instead  they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. We are talking about the high seas. The  high seas  is a legal term  but in fact  it covers    percent of the planet. With an average depth of the oceans of       meters  in fact  the high seas covers and provides nearly    percent of the habitat for life on this Earth. It is  in theory  the global commons  belonging to us all. But in reality  it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it. So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark. We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care. And then finally  we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean basin wide conservation  but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect. So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above    that area in the darker blue. To me  as an international lawyer  this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen  for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean  the global ocean  that provides us all with carbon storage  with heat storage  with oxygen  if you can only protect    percent. This is indeed the true heart of the planet. Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws    for example  shipping    provide more protection to the areas closest to shore. For example  garbage discharge  something you would think just simply goes away  but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore. As a result  we have garbage patches the size of twice Texas. It's unbelievable. We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution  but that has proved to be no longer the case. So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom  who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale  is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all. And these include a sense of shared responsibility  common norms that bind people together as a community. Conditional access  You can invite people in  but they have to be able to play by the rules. And of course  if you want people to play by the rules  you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement  for as we've discovered  you can trust  but you also need to verify. What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas. For a group of very dedicated individuals    scientists  conservationists  photographers and states    were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you. That is  we're able to save it from a fate of deep sea bottom trawling. And how did we do that  Well  as I said  we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process. But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations  trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed. So within three years  from      to       we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep sea bottom trawling. Instead of  go anywhere  do anything you want   we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm. In       when the U.N. reviewed progress  they discovered that almost     million square kilometers of seabed had been protected. This does not mean that it's the final solution  or that this even provides permanent protection. But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed  to create a new regime. So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true  blue perspective for this beautiful planet. Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage  that access to the heart of human beings  you might say  who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes  but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life cycle of creatures like these sea turtles  who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. Today  we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas  just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain. The Sargasso Sea  for example  is not a sea bounded by coastlines  but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there. It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm  and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. But the Sargasso Sea  the same way it aggregates sargassum weed  actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region. This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show  because I haven't been out there myself. But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are         pieces of plastic per square kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea  and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food. The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat. It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs. But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection. Thus  the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction    but the vast majority is beyond    to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area. Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now  the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean. It's actually a bay. It's considered high seas  because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims. So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas. But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what  till recently  has been a virtually intact near shore ecosystem. But unfortunately  CCAMLR  the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources  is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region. The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales  who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food. So what we need to do is to stand up boldly  singly and together  to push governments  to push regional fisheries management organizations  to declare our right to declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing  so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. Coming closer to here  the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area    potentially year round habitat for blue whales. There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long. But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is  in fact  it's not a permanent place. It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis. So  in fact  it's not permanently in the high seas. It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries  but it moves with the season. As such  it does create a challenge to protect  but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it. We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are  in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable  which may  in some cases  be year round. Getting closer to shore  where we are  this was in fact taken in the Galapagos. Many species are headed through this region  which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area. That is  it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative. It's protecting five World Heritage sites. Unfortunately  the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction  at present. So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas. So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention  so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites  or we need to change the name and call it Half the World Heritage Convention. But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape. These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre  where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this  or as bycatch. So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale up. We need to work locally  but we also need to work ocean basin wide. We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean basin wide initiative. We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project  one of the    Census of Marine Life projects. It's provided us data like this  of tiny  little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home. They fly        kilometers in less than a year. So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life. And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October. So stay tuned for further information. What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators  it's also looked in the really unexplored mid water column  where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found. And fortunately  we've been able  as IUCN  to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers. We have the support of governments now behind us. We've been revealing this information through technical workshops. And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots  hotspots. At the same time we're saying   Yes  we need more. We need to move forward.  But many of you have said  if you get these marine protected areas  or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place  how are you going to enforce it  Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science  which is outer space technology. I wanted to be an astronaut  so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space    and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about  in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life cycles in the open ocean. We can also tag and track fishing vessels. Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing. But not all the vessels have those to date. It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate  if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources  we need to know    someone needs to know    where you are and what you're doing. So it brings me to my main take home message  which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons. We can stop the collision course of    percent of the planet with the high seas. But we need to think broad scale. We need to think globally. We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources. We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect. At the same time  we need to think locally  which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish  is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas  and to bring people to the table  if you will  to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management. And third is that we need to look at ocean basin wide management. Our species are ocean basin wide. Many of the deep sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide. We need to better understand  but we also need to start to manage and protect. And in order to do that  you also need ocean basin management regimes. That is  we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone  but we need to scale these up  we need to build their capacity  so they're like the Southern Ocean  where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization. So with that  I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish  for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction. It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote. So on this tour  I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas  one  that it is our home too  and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. Thank you. So  a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist  I had a baby. And that's not to say I ever went on to become a brilliant  world class neuropsychologist. Sorry  TED. But I did go on to be a reasonably astute  arguably world class worrier. One of my girlfriends in graduate school  Marie  said   Kim  I figured it out. It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else  it's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are.  So in the spirit of full disclosure  I brought some pictures to share. Awwww. I'll just say  July. Zzzzzzip for safety. Water wings    an inch of water. And then  finally  all suited up for the    minute drive to Copper Mountain. So you can get kind of a feel for this. So my baby  Vander  is eight years old now. And  despite being cursed with my athletic inability  he plays soccer. He's interested in playing football. He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. So why would I worry  Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact  more than four million people sustain a concussion every year  and these data are just among kids under    who were seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion  we talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung  but what is it that we're really talking about  Let's take a look. All right.  Starsky and Hutch   arguably  yes. So a car accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier       Gs. A heavy weight boxer punches you straight in the face       Gs. In case you missed it  we'll look again. So look to the right hand side of the screen. What would you say  How many Gs  Close. Seventy two. Would it be crazy to know      Gs. The average concussive impact is    Gs. Now  when the kid on the right doesn't get up  we know they've had a concussion. But how about the kid on the left  or the athlete that leaves the field of play  How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion  How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play  cleared for return to play  applies to them  The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness  and that can be any one of a number of symptoms  including feeling foggy  feeling dizzy  hearing a ringing in your ear  being more impulsive or hostile than usual. So given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am  how do I get any sleep at all  Because I know our brains are resilient. They're designed to recover from an injury. If  God forbid  any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion  most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury. In fact  high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college age peers  and it takes them longer to return to a symptom free baseline. After that first injury  their risk for second injury is exponentially greater. From there  their risk for a third injury  greater still  and so on. And here's the really alarming part  we don't fully understand the long term impact of multiple injuries. You guys may be familiar with this research that's coming out of the NFL. In a nutshell  this research suggests that among retired NFL players with three or more career concussions  the incidents of early onset dementing disease is much greater than it is for the general population. So you've all seen that    New York Times  you've seen it. What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said   Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his keys  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing the car  Isn't it weird that my    year old husband is forever losing his way home in the car  from the driveway   So I may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. So it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around some day. So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids  How can we     percent guarantee the safety of our kids  Let me tell you what I've come up with. If only. My little boy's right there  and he's like   She's not kidding. She's totally not kidding.  So in all seriousness  should my kid play football  Should your kid play football  I don't know. But I do know there are three things you can do. The first  study up. You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. There are some great resources out there. The CDC has a program  Heads Up. It's at CDC.gov. Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids. The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of. We've just rolled this out in the last couple months    CO Kids With Brain Injury. This is a great resource for student athletes  teachers  parents  professionals  athletic and coaching staff. It's a great place to start if you have questions. The second thing is  speak up. Just two weeks ago  a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have required athletes  kids under     to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike died in committee. It died in large part because it lacked constituent buy in  it lacked stakeholder traction. Now I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support  but I am going to tell you that  if it matters to you  your legislators need to know that. Speak up also with coaching staff. Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available. What's the budget for protective equipment  How old it is  Maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear    which brings us to suit up. Wear a helmet. The only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening. Recently  one of my graduate students  Tom said   Kim  I've decided to wear a bike helmet on my way to class.  And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can reduce the G force of impact by half. Now I thought that it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade  right  this epiphany of Tom's. As it turns out  it occurred to Tom that a     helmet is a good way to protect a          graduate education. So  should Vander play football  I can't say no  but I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house that kid's wearing a helmet    like to the car  or at school. So whether athlete  scholar  over protected kid  neurotic mom  or otherwise  here's my baby  Vander  reminding you to mind your matter. Thank you. I woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion. It was deep at night. I do not remember what time it was. I just remember the sound was so heavy and so very shocking. Everything in my room was shaking    my heart  my windows  my bed  everything. I looked out the windows and I saw a full half circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies  but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray  and a full circle of explosion. And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared. I went back to my bed  and I prayed  and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home  that it did not kill my family that night. Thirty years have passed  and I still feel guilty about that prayer  for the next day  I learned that that missile landed on my brother's friend's home and killed him and his father  but did not kill his mother or his sister. His mother showed up the next week at my brother's classroom and begged seven year old kids to share with her any picture they may have of her son  for she had lost everything. This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war  and nameless refugees  whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our TV with tattered clothes  dirty face  scared eyes. This is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war  who we do not know their hopes  their dreams  their accomplishments  their families  their beliefs  their values. This is my story. I was that girl. I am another image and vision of another survivor of war. I am that refugee  and I am that girl. You see  I grew up in war torn Iraq  and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it. We only talk about one side of it. But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it. I grew up with the colors of war    the red colors of fire and blood  the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile  so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of war    the staccato sounds of gunfire  the wrenching booms of explosions  ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. These are the sounds you would expect  but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night  the high pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous  unbearable silence.  War   a friend of mine said   is not about sound at all. It is actually about silence  the silence of humanity.  I have since left Iraq and founded a group called Women for Women International that ends up working with women survivors of wars. In my travels and in my work  from Congo to Afghanistan  from Sudan to Rwanda  I have learned not only that the colors and the sounds of war are the same  but the fears of war are the same. You know  there is a fear of dying  and do not believe any movie character where the hero is not afraid. It is very scary to go through that feeling of  I am about to die  or  I could die in this explosion.  But there's also the fear of losing loved ones  and I think that's even worse. It's too painful. You don't want to think about it. But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear    as Samia  a Bosnian woman  once told me  who survived the four years besiege of Sarajevo  she said   The fear of losing the 'I' in me  the fear of losing the 'I' in me.  That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me. It's like dying from inside out. A Palestinian woman once told me   It is not about the fear of one death   she said   sometimes I feel I die    times in one day   as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets. She said   But it's not fair  because there is only one life  and there should only be one death.  We have been only seeing one side of war. We have only been discussing and consumed with high level preoccupations over troop levels  drawdown timelines  surges and sting operations  when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn  where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going. We have been so consumed with seemingly objective discussions of politics  tactics  weapons  dollars and casualties. This is the language of sterility. How casually we treat casualties in the context of this topic. This is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities. Eighty percent of refugees around the world are women and children. Oh. Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians. Seventy five percent of them are women and children. How interesting. Oh  half a million women in Rwanda get raped in     days. Or  as we speak now  hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated. How interesting. These just become numbers that we refer to. The front of wars is increasingly non human eyes peering down on our perceived enemies from space  guiding missiles toward unseen targets  while the human conduct of the orchestra of media relations in the event that this particular drone attack hits a villager instead of an extremist. It is a chess game. You learn to play an international relations school on your way out and up to national and international leadership. Checkmate. We are missing a completely other side of wars. We are missing my mother's story  who made sure with every siren  with every raid  with every cut off of electricity  she played puppet shows for my brothers and I  so we would not be scared of the sounds of explosions. We are missing the story of Fareeda  a music teacher  a piano teacher  in Sarajevo  who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school  despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her  and kept the piano  the violin  the cello playing the whole duration of the war  with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. That was her fight. That was her resistance. We are missing the story of Nehia  a Palestinian woman in Gaza who  the minute there was a cease fire in the last year's war  she left out of home  collected all the flour and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have  in case there is no cease fire the day after. We are missing the stories of Violet  who  despite surviving genocide in the church massacre  she kept on going on  burying bodies  cleaning homes  cleaning the streets. We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. Do you know    do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going  And the ones who are keeping that life are women. There are two sides of war. There is a side that fights  and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open. There is a side that is focused on winning battles  and there is a side that is focused on winning life. There is a side that leads the front line discussion  and there is a side that leads the back line discussion. There is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting  and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs. There is a side that is led by men  and there is a side that is led by women. And in order for us to understand how do we build lasting peace  we must understand war and peace from both sides. We must have a full picture of what that means. In order for us to understand what actually peace means  we need to understand  as one Sudanese woman once told me   Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again.  She grew up in Sudan  in Southern Sudan  for    years of war  where it killed one million people and displaced five million refugees. Many women were taken as slaves by rebels and soldiers  as sexual slaves who were forced also to carry the ammunition and the water and the food for the soldiers. So that woman walked for    years  so she would not be kidnapped again. And only when there was some sort of peace  her toenails grew back again. We need to understand peace from a toenail's perspective. We need to understand that we cannot actually have negotiations of ending of wars or peace without fully including women at the negotiating table. I find it amazing that the only group of people who are not fighting and not killing and not pillaging and not burning and not raping  and the group of people who are mostly    though not exclusively    who are keeping life going in the midst of war  are not included in the negotiating table. And I do argue that women lead the back line discussion  but there are also men who are excluded from that discussion. The doctors who are not fighting  the artists  the students  the men who refuse to pick up the guns  they are  too  excluded from the negotiating tables. There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace  building of democracy  sustainable economies  any kind of stabilities  if we do not fully include women at the negotiating table. Not one  but    percent. There is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don't start investing in women and girls. Did you know that one year of the world's military spending equals     years of the U.N. budget and equals       years of the U.N. budget allocated for women  If we just reverse that distribution of funds  perhaps we could have a better lasting peace in this world. And last  but not least  we need to invest in peace and women  not only because it is the right thing to do  not only because it is the right thing to do  for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today  but it is for the future. A Congolese woman  who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them  and her children saw their nine year old sibling killed in front of them  how they're doing okay right now. She got into Women for Women International's program. She got a support network. She learned about her rights. We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job. She was earning     dollars. She was doing okay. She was sending them to school. Have a new home. She said   But what I worry about the most is not any of that. I worry that my children have hate in their hearts  and when they want to grow up  they want to fight again the killers of their father and their brother.  We need to invest in women  because that's our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future. That mother has a better chance to heal her children than any peace agreement can do. Are there good news  Of course  there are good news. There are lots of good news. To start with  these women that I told you about are dancing and singing every single day  and if they can  who are we not to dance  That girl that I told you about ended up starting Women for Women International Group that impacted one million people  sent    million dollars  and I started this from zero  nothing  nada   unclear . They are women who are standing on their feet in spite of their circumstances  not because of it. Think of how the world can be a much better place if  for a change  we have a better equality  we have equality  we have a representation and we understand war  both from the front line and the back line discussion. Rumi  a   th century Sufi poet  says   Out beyond the worlds of right doings and wrong doings  there is a field. I will meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass  the world is too full to talk about. Ideas  language  even the phrase 'each other' no longer makes any sense.  I humbly add    humbly add    that out beyond the worlds of war and peace  there is a field  and there are many women and men  who  are meeting there. Let us make this field a much bigger place. Let us all meet in that field. Thank you. So I'm going to talk about work  specifically  why people can't seem to get work done at work  which is a problem we all kind of have. But let's sort of start at the beginning. So  we have companies and non profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort. And they expect these people who work for them to do great work    I would hope  at least. At least good work  hopefully  at least it's good work    hopefully great work. And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work. So a company  or a charity  or an organization of any kind  unless you're working in Africa  if you're really lucky to do that    most people have to go to an office every day. And so these companies  they build offices. They go out and they buy a building  or they rent a building  or they lease some space  and they fill this space with stuff. They fill it with tables  or desks  chairs  computer equipment  software  Internet access  maybe a fridge  maybe a few other things  and they expect their employees  or their volunteers  to come to that location every day to do great work. It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that. However  if you actually talk to people and even question yourself  and you ask yourself  where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done  You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say. If you ask people the question  Where do you need to go when you need to get something done  Typically  you get three different kinds of answers. One is kind of a place or a location or a room. Another one is a moving object  and a third is a time. So here are some examples. I've been asking people this question for about    years   Where do you go when you really need to get something done   I'll hear things like  the porch  the deck  the kitchen. I'll hear things like an extra room in the house  the basement  the coffee shop  the library. And then you'll hear things like the train  a plane  a car    so  the commute. And then you'll hear people say   Well  it doesn't really matter where I am  as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends.  You almost never hear someone say   The office.  But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office  and they're making people go to it all the time  yet people don't do work in the office. What is that about  Why is that  Why is that happening  And what you find out is  if you dig a little bit deeper  you find out that people    this is what happens  People go to work  and they're basically trading in their work day for a series of  work moments     that's what happens at the office. You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments. It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart  and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits  because you have    minutes here     minutes there  and something else happens  you're pulled off your work  then you have    minutes  then it's lunch  then you have something else to do ... Then you've got    minutes  and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question  and before you know it  it's   p.m.  and you look back on the day  and you realize that you didn't get anything done. We've all been through this. We probably went through it yesterday or the day before  or the day before that. You look back on your day  and you're like   I got nothing done today. I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer. I used the software they told me to use. I went to these meetings I was asked to go to. I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff. But I didn't actually do anything. I just did tasks. I didn't actually get meaningful work done.  And what you find is that  especially with creative people    designers  programmers  writers  engineers  thinkers    that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done. You cannot ask somebody to be creative in    minutes and really think about a problem. You might have a quick idea  but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully  you need long stretches of uninterrupted time. And even though the work day is typically eight hours  how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office  How about seven hours  Six  Five  Four  When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office  Two hours  One  maybe  Very  very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office. And this is why people choose to do work at home  or they might go to the office  but they might go to the office really early in the day  or late at night when no one's around  or they stick around after everyone's left  or go in on the weekends  or they get work done on the plane  in the car or in the train  because there are no distractions. Now there are different kinds of distractions  but not the really bad distractions  which I'll talk about in a minute. And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted  and that is sleep. I think that sleep and work are very closely related    not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working. That's not really what I mean. I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase based  or stage based  events. Sleep is about sleep phases  or stages    some people call them different things. There are five of them  and in order to get to the really deep ones  the meaningful ones  you have to go through the early ones. If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones    if someone bumps you in bed  or there's a sound  or whatever happens    you don't just pick up where you left off. If you're interrupted and woken up  you have to start again. So you have to go back a few phases and start again. And what ends up happening    you might have days like this where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning  or whenever you get up  and you're like   I didn't sleep very well. I did the sleep thing    I went to bed  I laid down  but I didn't really sleep.  People say you go  to  sleep  but you don't go to sleep  you go towards sleep  it takes a while. You've got to go through phases and stuff  and if you're interrupted  you don't sleep well. So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night  I don't think anyone would say yes. Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office  How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they go to the office and are interrupted  That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense  to me. So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places  Because in other places  you can have interruptions like the TV  or you could go for a walk  or there's a fridge downstairs  or you've got your own couch  or whatever you want to do. If you talk to certain managers  they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions. They'll sometimes also say   If I can't see the person  how do I know they're working   which is ridiculous  but that's one of the excuses that managers give. And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes. We all have to improve on this sort of thing. But oftentimes they'll cite distractions   I can't let someone work at home. They'll watch TV  or do this other thing.  It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting  Because those are voluntary distractions. You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV  when you want to turn something on  or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk. At the office  most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary. So let's go through a couple of those. Now  managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites  and in fact  they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work. Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites. I mean  is this China  What the hell is going on here  You can't go to a website at work  and that's the problem  That's why people aren't getting work done  because they're on Facebook and Twitter  That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy. Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube  these things are just modern day smoke breaks. No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for    minutes    years ago  so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook or Twitter or YouTube here and there  Those aren't the real problems in the office. The real problems are what I like to call the M Ms  the Managers and the Meetings. Those are the real problems in the modern office today. And this is why things don't get done at work  it's because of the M Ms. Now what's interesting is  if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work  like at home  in the car  on a plane  late at night  or early in the morning  you don't find managers and meetings. You find a lot of other distractions  but not managers and meetings. So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere  but you do find at the office. And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people. That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people. They don't really do the work  so they make sure everyone else is doing work  which is an interruption. We have lots of managers in the world now  and a lot of people in the world  and a lot of interruptions by these managers. They have to check in   Hey  how's it going  Show me what's up.  This sort of thing. They keep interrupting you at the wrong time  while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do  they tend to interrupt you. That's kind of bad. But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all  which is call meetings. And meetings are just toxic  terrible  poisonous things during the day at work. We all know this to be true  and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees. It doesn't work that way. The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together  and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people    to say   Hey look  we're going to bring    people together right now and have a meeting. I don't care what you're doing  you've got to stop doing it  so you can have this meeting.  I mean  what are the chances that all    people are ready to stop  What if they're thinking about something important  or doing important work  All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else. So they go into a meeting room  they get together  and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter  usually. Because meetings aren't work. Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later. But meetings also procreate. So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting  which leads to another meeting. There's often too many people in the meetings  and they're very  very expensive to the organization. Companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting  but that's not true  unless there's only one person. If there are    people  it's a    hour meeting  not a one hour meeting. It's    hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting  which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes. But instead  there's a long scheduled meeting  because meetings are scheduled the way software works  which is in increments of    minutes  or    minutes  or an hour. You don't schedule an eight hour meeting with Outlook  you can't. You can go    minutes or    minutes or    minutes or an hour. And so we tend to fill these times up when things should go really quickly. So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today  especially at offices. These things don't exist outside of the office. So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation. What can managers do    enlightened managers  hopefully    what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work  so it's not the last resort  but it's the first resort  so that people start to say   When I really want to get stuff done  I go to the office.  Because the offices are well equipped  everything is there for them to do the work. But they don't want to go there right now  so how do we change that  I have three suggestions to share with you. I have about three minutes  so that'll fit perfectly. We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing. I don't know if people still do that. But how about  No talk Thursdays   Pick one Thursday once a month  and cut it in half  just the afternoon    I'll make it easy for you. So just the afternoon  one Thursday. First Thursday of the month  just the afternoon  nobody in the office can talk to each other. Just silence  that's it. And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other. This is when people actually get stuff done  is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them. Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work. It's better than a computer  better than a new monitor  better than new software  or whatever people typically use. Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable. If you try that  I think you'll agree  and hopefully you can do it more often. So maybe it's every other week  or every week  once a week  afternoons no one can talk to each other. That's something that you'll find will really  really work. Another thing you can try  is switching from active communication and collaboration  which is like face to face stuff    tapping people on the shoulder  saying hi to them  having meetings  and replace that with more passive models of communication  using things like email and instant messaging  or collaboration products  things like that. Now some people might say email is really distracting  I.M. is really distracting  and these other things are really distracting  but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing. You can quit the email app  you can't quit your boss. You can quit I.M.  you can't hide your manager. You can put these things away  and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule  at your own time  when you're available  when you're ready to go again. Because work  like sleep  happens in phases. So you'll be going up  doing some work  and then you'll come down from that work  and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M. There are very  very few things that are that urgent  that need to happen  that need to be answered right this second. So if you're a manager  start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule. And the last suggestion I have is that  if you do have a meeting coming up  if you have the power  just cancel it. Just cancel that next meeting. Today's Friday  usually people have meetings on Monday. Just don't have it. I don't mean move it  I mean just erase it from memory  it's gone. And you'll find out that everything will be just fine. All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at   a.m. on Monday  just forget about them  and things will be fine. People will have a more open morning  they can actually think. You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do  you don't actually have to do. So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about. I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people  to think about laying off a little bit  and giving people more time to get work done. I think it'll all pay off in the end. So  thanks for listening. Thank you very much. I have a few pictures  and I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do. All these houses are built from between    and    percent recycled material  stuff that was headed to the mulcher  the landfill  the burn pile. It was all just gone. This is the first house I built. This double front door here with the three light transom that was headed to the landfill. Have a little turret there. And then these buttons on the corbels here. Right there    those are hickory nuts. And these buttons there    those are chicken eggs. Of course  first you have breakfast  and then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up  and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time. Then  this is a look at the inside. You can see the three light transom there with the eyebrow windows    certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill. Even the lockset is probably worth     dollars. Everything in the kitchen was salvaged. There's a      O'Keefe   Merritt stove  if you like to cook    cool stove. This is going up into the turret. I got that staircase for    dollars  including delivery to my lot. Then  looking up in the turret  you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth. Well  if that ruins your life  well then you shouldn't live there. This is a laundry chute  and this right here is a shoe last. And those are those cast iron things you see at antique shops. So I had one of those  so I made some low tech gadgetry  there  where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open  you throw your laundry down. And then if you're smart enough  it goes on a basket on top of the washer. If not  it goes into the toilet. This is a bathtub I made  made out of scrap two by four here. Started with a rim there and then glued and nailed it up into a flat  corbelled it up and flipped it over  then did the two profiles on this side. It's a two person tub. After all  it's not just a question of hygiene  but there's a possibility of recreation as well. Then  this faucet here is just a piece of Osage Orange. It looks a little phallic  but after all  it's a bathroom. Then  this is a house based on a Budweiser can. It doesn't look like a can of beer  but the design take offs are absolutely unmistakable. The barley hops design worked up into the eaves  then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red  white  blue and silver. Then  these corbeles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can. I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want. Then  on the can it says   This is the famous Budweiser beer  we know of no other beer  blah  blah  blah.  So we changed that and put   This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house   and so forth and so on. Then  this is a deadbolt. It's a fence from a     s shaper  which is a very angry woodworking machine. And they gave me the fence  but they didn't give me the shaper  so we made a deadbolt out of it. That'll keep bull elephants out  I promise. And sure enough  we've had no problems with bull elephants. The shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer. We've got bubbles going up there  then suds at the top with lumpy tiles. Where do you get lumpy tiles  Well  of course  you don't. But I get a lot of toilets  and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer  and then you have lumpy tiles. And then the faucet  there  is a beer tap. Then  this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle class front door in America. We're getting tired of it. It's kind of cliched now. So if you put it in the front door  your design fails. So don't put it in the front door  put it somewhere else. It's a pretty panel of glass. But then if you put it in the front door  people say   Oh  you're trying to be like those guys  and you didn't make it.  So don't put it there. Then  another bathroom upstairs. This light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle class foyer in America. Don't put it in the foyer. Put it in the shower  or in the closet  but not in the foyer. Then  somebody gave me a bidet  so it got a bidet. This little house here  those branches there are made out of Bois D'arc or Osage Orange  and these pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit. In order to do what I do  you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry. Our housing has become a commodity  and I'll talk a little bit about that. But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA. Human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the apperceptive mass. What does that mean  What it means is  for every perception we have  it needs to tally with the one like it before  or we don't have continuity  and we become a little bit disoriented. So I can show you an object you've never seen before. Oh  that's a cell phone. But you've never seen this one before. What you're doing is sizing up the pattern of structural features here  and then you go through your databanks    brrrr  cell phone. Oh  that's a cell phone. If I took a bite out of it  you'd go   Wait a second. That's not a cell phone. That's one of those new chocolate cell phones.  And you'd have to start a new category  right between cell phones and chocolate. That's how we process information. So you translate that to the building industry  if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked  we go   Oh  dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it. Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in.  Because that's what you do with a cracked pane. Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all. It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features. However  if we took a small hammer  and we added cracks to all the other windows  then we have a pattern. Because Gestalt Psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern over parts that comprise a pattern. We'll go   Ooh  that's nice.  So  that serves me every day. Repetition creates pattern. If I have a hundred of these  a hundred of those  it doesn't make any difference what these and those are. If I can repeat anything  I have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs  shards of glass  branches. It doesn't make any difference. That causes a lot of waste in the building industry. Second is  Friedrich Nietzsche along about      wrote a book titled  The Birth of Tragedy.  And in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives. On the one hand  we have an Apollonian perspective  which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect. On the other end of the spectrum  we have a Dionysian perspective  which is more given to the passions and intuition  tolerant of organic texture and human gesture. So the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture  or hangs a picture  is they'll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer.  Okay  honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left. That's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect.  Predicated on plumb level  square and centered. The Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes ... That's the difference. I feature blemish. I feature organic process. Dead center John Dewey. Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste. If something isn't perfect  if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model  dumpster.  Oops  scratch  dumpster.   Oops  this   oops  that.  Landfill. Landfill. Landfill.  The third thing is arguably    the Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance with the rise of humanism  then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution. By the middle of the   th century  it's in full flower. And we have dumaflages and gizmos and contraptions that will do anything that we  up to that point  had to do my hand. So now we have standardized materials. Well  trees don't grow two inches by four inches  eight  ten and twelve feet tall. We create mountains of waste. And they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest  working all the byproduct of their industry    with OSB and particle board and so forth and so on    but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption  and that's what's happening. And so if something isn't standard   Oops  dumpster.   Oops  this.  Oops  warped.  If you buy a two by four and it's not straight  you can take it back.  Oh  I'm so sorry  sir. We'll get you a straight one.  Well I feature all those warped things because repetition creates pattern  and it's from a Dionysian perspective. The fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials. Well  that's just a myth. And here's a story  Jim Tulles  one of the guys I trained  I said   Jim  it's time now. I got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. It's time for you to go.   Dan  I just don't think I'm ready.   Jim  now it's time. You're the down  oh.  So we hired on. And he was out there with his tape measure going through the trash heap  looking for header material  which is the board that goes over a door  thinking he'd impress his boss    that's how we taught him to do it. And the superintendent walked up and said   What are you doing    Oh  just looking for some header material   waiting for that kudos. He said   No  no. I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work.  And he had the wherewithal to say  he said   You know  if you were paying me     dollars an hour  I can see how you might say that  but right now  I'm saving you five dollars a minute. Do the math.   Good call  Tulles. From now on  you guys hit this pile first.  And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math. But once in a while you get access to the control room  and then you can kind of mess with the dials. And that's what happened there. The fifth thing is that maybe  after       years  Plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms. He said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want  and we force environmental resources to accommodate that. So we all have in our head the perfect house  the American dream  which is a house  the dream house. The problem is we can't afford it. So we have the American dream look alike  which is a mobile home. Now there's a blight on the planet. It's a chattel mortgage  just like furniture  just like a car. You write the check  and instantly it depreciates    percent. After a year  you can't get insurance on everything you have in it  only on    percent. Wired with    gauge wire typically. Nothing wrong with that  unless you ask it to do what    gauge wire's supposed to do  and that's what happens. It out gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger. Are we just being numbingly stupid  The walls are this thick. The whole thing has the structural value of corn.  So I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there.   No  no. We had a wind last night. It's gone now.  Then when they degrade  what do you do with them  Now  all that  that Apollonian  Platonic model  is what the building industry is predicated on  and there are a number of things that exacerbate that. One is that all the professionals  all the tradesmen  vendors  inspectors  engineers  architects all think like this. And then it works its way back to the consumer  who demands the same model. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it. Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.  Woo. Woohooo.  We buy stuff we didn't know we needed. All we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice. How disgusting. But you know what they did  They hooked a metaphor into it and said   I drink Dr. Pepper ...  And pretty soon  we're swilling that stuff by the lake ful  by the billions of gallons. It doesn't even have real prunes. Doesn't even keep you regular. My oh my  that makes it worse. And we get sucked into that faster than anything. Then a man named Jean Paul Sartre wrote a book titled  Being and Nothingness.  It's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day. In there he talked about the divided self. He said human beings act differently when they know they're alone than when they know somebody else is around. So if I'm eating spaghetti  and I know I'm alone  I can eat like a backhoe. I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve  napkin on the table  chew with my mouth open  make little noises  scratch wherever I want. But as soon as you walk in  I go   Ooh. Spaghetti sauce there.  Napkin in my lap  half bites  chew with my mouth closed  no scratching. Now what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations of how I should live my life. I feel that expectation  and so I accommodate it  and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do. That happens in the building industry as well. That's why all of our subdivisions look the same. Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations. I'll bet all your shoes match. Sure enough  we all buy into that  and with gated communities  we have a formalized expectation with a homeowners association. Sometimes those guys are Nazis  my oh my. That exacerbates and continues this model. The last thing is gregariousness. Human beings are a social species. We like to hang together in groups  just like wildebeests  just like lions. Wildebeests don't hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests. Human beings are like that. We do what that group does that we're trying to identify with. And so you see this in junior high a lot. Those kids  they'll work all summer long  kill themselves  so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans. So along about September they can stride in and go   I'm important today. See  look  don't touch my designer jeans. I see you don't have designer jeans. You're not one of the beautiful people. See  I'm one of the beautiful people. See my jeans   Right there is reason enough to have uniforms. And so that happens in the building industry as well. We have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs just a little bit. On the bottom tier we have basic needs    shelter  clothing  food  water  mating and so forth. Second  security. Third  relationships. Fourth  status  self esteem    that is  vanity. And we're taking vanity and shoving it down here. And so we end up with vain decisions and we can't even afford our mortgage. We can't even afford to eat anything except beans. That is  our housing has become a commodity. And it takes a little bit of nerve to dive into those primal  terrifying parts of ourselves and make our own decisions and not make our housing a commodity  but make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources. That takes a little bit of nerve  and  darn it  once in a while you fail. But that's okay. If failure destroys you  then you can't do this. I fail all the time  every day  and I've had some whopping failures  I promise  big  public  humiliating  embarrassing failures. Everybody points and laughs  and they say   He tried it a fifth time and it still didn't work. What a moron.  Early on  contractors come by and say   Dan  you're a cute little bunny  but you know  this just isn't going to work. What don't you do this  and why don't you do that   And your instinct is to say   Why don't you suck an egg   But you don't say that  because they're the guys you're targeting. And so what we've done    and this isn't just in housing. It's in clothing and food and our transportation needs  our energy    we sprawl just a little bit. And when I get a little bit of press  I hear from people all over the world. And we may have invented excess  but the problem of waste is worldwide. We're in trouble. And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana  but we're clearly in trouble. And what we need to do is reconnect with those really primal parts of ourselves and make some decisions and say   You know  I think I would like to put CDs across the wall there. What do you think  honey   If it doesn't work  take it down. What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are  and that's thrilling indeed. Thank you very much. Hello. My name is Birke Baehr  and I'm    years old. I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system. First of all  I would like to say that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe all the marketing and advertising on TV  at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look. It seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids  like me  to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet. Little kids  especially  are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys. I must admit  I used to be one of them. I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy  little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. What I discovered was this is not true. I began to look into this stuff on the Internet  in books and in documentary films  in my travels with my family. I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system. First  there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms. That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature    like taking the DNA of a fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck. Don't get me wrong  I like fish and tomatoes  but this is just creepy. The seeds are then planted  then grown. The food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals  and people have been eating food produced this way since the     s. And most folks don't even know they exist. Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity  These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight. Yet almost all the corn we eat has been altered genetically in some way. And let me tell you  corn is in everything. And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations called CAFOS. Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow. They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again. Next  more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables  like pesticides and herbicides  to kill weeds and bugs. When it rains  these chemicals seep into the ground  or run off into our waterways  poisoning our water too. Then they irradiate our food  trying to make it last longer  so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets. So I ask myself  how can I change  How can I change these things  This is what I found out. I discovered that there's a movement for a better way. Now a while back  I wanted to be an NFL football player. I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead. Thank you. And that way I can have a greater impact on the world. This man  Joel Salatin  they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system. Since I'm home schooled  I went to go hear him speak one day. This man  this  lunatic farmer   doesn't use any pesticides  herbicides  or genetically modified seeds. And so for that  he's called crazy by the system. I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices  by buying our food directly from local farmers  or our neighbors who we know in real life. Some people say organic or local food is more expensive  but is it really  With all these things I've been learning about the food system  it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer  or we can pay the hospital. Now I know definitely which one I would choose. I want you to know that there are farms out there    like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee    whose cows do eat grass and whose pigs do roll in the mud  just like I thought. Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer  so I can see up close and personal where the meat I eat comes from. I want you to know that I believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from. I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up. I want you to know that me  my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips. I try to share this everywhere I go. Not too long ago  my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal. He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's or the sugarcoated flakes    you know  the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front. My little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal. And that  my friends  is how we can make a difference one kid at a time. So next time you're at the grocery store  think local  choose organic  know your farmer and know your food. Thank you. Well  the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East  of a man who left to his three sons     camels. To the first son  he left half the camels  to the second son  he left a third of the camels  and to the youngest son  he left a ninth of the camels. The three sons got into a negotiation       doesn't divide by two. It doesn't divide by three. It doesn't divide by nine. Brotherly tempers started to get strained. Finally  in desperation  they went and they consulted a wise old woman. The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time  and finally she came back and said   Well  I don't know if I can help you  but at least  if you want  you can have my camel.  So then  they had    camels. The first son took his half    half of    is nine. The second son took his third    a third of    is six. The youngest son took his ninth    a ninth of    is two. You get   . They had one camel left over. They gave it back to the wise old woman. Now  if you think about that story for a moment  I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in. They start off like    camels  no way to resolve it. Somehow  what we need to do is step back from those situations  like that wise old woman  look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an   th camel. Finding that   th camel in the world's conflicts has been my life passion. I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers. We're all one family. We know that scientifically  thanks to the communications revolution  all the tribes on the planet    all        tribes    are in touch with each other. And it's a big family reunion. And yet  like many family reunions  it's not all peace and light. There's a lot of conflict  and the question is  How do we deal with our differences  How do we deal with our deepest differences  given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction  That's the question. As I've spent the last better part of three decades  almost four  traveling the world  trying to work  getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela    some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet    I've been asking myself that question. And I think I've found  in some ways  what is the secret to peace. It's actually surprisingly simple. It's not easy  but it's simple. It's not even new. It may be one of our most ancient human heritages. The secret to peace is us. It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict  who can play a constructive role. Let me give you just a story  an example. About    years ago  I was in South Africa  working with the parties in that conflict  and I had an extra month  so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen. I was curious about them  about the way in which they resolve conflict. Because  after all  within living memory  they were hunters and gatherers  living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe    percent of the human story. And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting    absolutely fatal. So how do they deal with their differences  Well  what I learned is  whenever tempers rise in those communities  someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush  and then everyone sits around in a circle like this  and they sit and they talk and they talk. It may take two days  three days  four days  but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet    a reconciliation. And if tempers are still too high  then they send someone off to visit some relatives  as a cooling off period. Well  that system is  I think  probably the system that kept us alive to this point  given our human tendencies. That system  I call  the third side.  Because if you think about it  normally when we think of conflict  when we describe it  there's always two sides    it's Arabs versus Israelis  labor versus management  husband versus wife  Republicans versus Democrats. But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side  and the third side of the conflict is us  it's the surrounding community  it's the friends  the allies  the family members  the neighbors. And we can play an incredibly constructive role. Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake. For the sake of the kids  for the sake of the family  for the sake of the community  for the sake of the future  let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking. Because  the thing is  when we're involved in conflict  it's very easy to lose perspective. It's very easy to react. Human beings    we're reaction machines. And as the saying goes  when angry  you will make the best speech you will ever regret. And so the third side reminds us of that. The third side helps us go to the balcony  which is a metaphor for a place of perspective  where we can keep our eyes on the prize. Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience. Some years ago  I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya. There was a war going on  as you know. And we met in the Hague  in the Peace Palace  in the same room where the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place. And the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians and said   You should stay right here in your seats  because you're going to be on trial for war crimes.  And then he turned to me and said   You're an American. Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico.  And my mind started racing   Puerto Rico  What do I know about Puerto Rico   I started reacting. But then  I tried to remember to go to the balcony. And then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response  from a balcony perspective  I was able to thank him for his remarks and say   I appreciate your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another.   And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past. We're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya.  The conversation got back on track. That's the role of the third side  to help the parties go to the balcony. Now let me take you  for a moment  to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict  or the most impossible conflict  the Middle East. Question is  where's the third side there  How could we possibly go to the balcony  Now  I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict  but I think I've got a first step    literally  a first step    something that any one of us could do as third siders. Let me just ask you one question first. How many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East and wondering what anyone could do  Just out of curiosity  how many of you  OK  so the great majority of us. And here  it's so far away. Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict  Is it the number of deaths  There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa than in the Middle East. No  it's because of the story  because we feel personally involved in that story. Whether we're Christians  Muslims or Jews  religious or non religious  we feel we have a personal stake in it. Stories matter  as an anthropologist  I know that. Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge. They give meaning to our lives. That's what we tell here at TED  we tell stories. Stories are the key. And so my question is    yes  let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East  but let's also take a look at the story. Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about. Let's see if we can apply the third side to it. What would that mean  What is the story there  Now  as anthropologists  we know that every culture has an origin story. What's the origin story of the Middle East  In a phrase  it's  Four thousand years ago  a man and his family walked across the Middle East  and the world has never been the same since. That man  of course  was Abraham. And what he stood for was unity  the unity of the family  he's the father of us all. But it's not just what he stood for  it's what his message was. His basic message was unity too  the interconnectedness of it all  the unity of it all. And his basic value was respect  was kindness toward strangers. That's what he's known for  his hospitality. So in that sense  he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East. He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole. Now  think about that for a moment. Today  we face the scourge of terrorism. What is terrorism  Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear. What's the opposite of terrorism  It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home  in order to sow and create understanding or respect  or love. So what if  then  you took the story of Abraham  which is a third side story  what if that could be    because Abraham stands for hospitality    what if that could be an antidote to terrorism  What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance  How would you bring that story to life  Now  it's not enough just to tell a story. That's powerful  but people need to experience the story. They need to be able to live the story. How would you do that  And that was my thinking of how would you do that. And that's what comes to the first step here. Because the simple way to do that is  you go for a walk. You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham. You retrace the footsteps of Abraham. Because walking has a real power. You know  as an anthropologist  walking is what made us human. It's funny    when you walk  you walk side by side  in the same common direction. Now if I were to come to you face to face and come this close to you  you would feel threatened. But if I walk shoulder to shoulder  even touching shoulders  it's no problem. Who fights while they walk  That's why in negotiations  often  when things get tough  people go for walks in the woods. So the idea came to me of  what about inspiring a path  a route    think the Silk Route  think the Appalachian Trail    that followed in the footsteps of Abraham  People said   That's crazy. You can't. You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham    it's too insecure  you've got to cross all these borders  it goes across    different countries in the Middle East  because it unites them all.  And so we studied the idea at Harvard. We did our due diligence. And then a few years ago  a group of us  about    of us from    different countries  decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham  going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa in Southern Turkey  Northern Mesopotamia. And we then took a bus and took some walks and went to Harran  where  in the Bible  he sets off on his journey. Then we crossed the border into Syria  went to Aleppo  which  turns out  is named after Abraham. We went to Damascus  which has a long history associated with Abraham. We then came to Northern Jordan  to Jerusalem    which is all about Abraham    to Bethlehem  and finally  to the place where he's buried  in Hebron. So effectively  we went from womb to tomb. We showed it could be done. It was an amazing journey. Let me ask you a question. How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land  and a total stranger  perfect stranger  comes up to you and shows you some kindness    maybe invites you into their home  gives you a drink  gives you a coffee  gives you a meal  How many of you have ever had that experience  That's the essence of the Abraham Path. That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East where you expect hostility  and you get the most amazing hospitality  all associated with Abraham   In the name of Father Ibrahim  let me offer you some food.  So what we discovered is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people  he's alive  he's a living presence. And to make a long story short  in the last couple of years now  thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham in the Middle East  enjoying the hospitality of the people there. They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine  in Jordan  in Turkey  in Syria. It's an amazing experience. Men  women  young people  old people    more women than men  actually  interestingly. For those who can't walk  who are unable to get there right now  people started to organize walks in cities  in their own communities. In Cincinnati  for instance  they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together. It was Abraham Path Day. In S o Paulo  Brazil  it's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run  uniting the different communities. The media love it  they really adore it. They lavish attention on it because it's visual and it spreads the idea  this idea of Abrahamic hospitality  of kindness towards strangers. And just a couple weeks ago  there was an NPR story on it. Last month  there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it  two whole pages. And they quoted a villager who said   This walk connects us to the world.  He said   It was like a light that went on in our lives    it brought us hope.  And so that's what it's about. But it's not just about psychology  it's about economics. Because as people walk  they spend money. And this woman right here  Um Ahmad  is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan. She's desperately poor. She's partially blind  her husband can't work  she's got seven kids. But what she can do is cook. And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and have a meal in her home. They sit on the floor    she doesn't even have a tablecloth. She makes the most delicious food  that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside. And so more and more walkers have come  and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family. And so she told our team there  she said   You have made me visible in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me.  That's the potential of the Abraham Path. There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the Middle East  across the path. The potential is basically to change the game. And to change the game  you have to change the frame  the way we see things    to change the frame from hostility to hospitality  from terrorism to tourism. And in that sense  the Abraham Path is a game changer. Let me just show you one thing. I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year. Now  the acorn is associated with the oak tree  of course    grows into an oak tree  which is associated with Abraham. The path right now is like an acorn  it's still in its early phase. What would the oak tree look like  When I think back to my childhood  a good part of which I spent  after being born here in Chicago  I spent in Europe. If you had been in the ruins of  say  London in       or Berlin  and you had said   Sixty years from now  this is going to be the most peaceful  prosperous part of the planet   people would have thought you were certifiably insane. But they did it  thanks to a common identity  Europe  and a common economy. So my question is  if it can be done in Europe  why not in the Middle East  Why not  thanks to a common identity  which is the story of Abraham  and thanks to a common economy that would be based  in good part  on tourism  So let me conclude  then  by saying that in the last    years  as I've worked in some of the most dangerous  difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet  I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed. It's not easy  of course. But it's possible. It was done in South Africa. It was done in Northern Ireland. It could be done anywhere. It simply depends on us. It depends on us taking the third side. So let me invite you to consider taking the third side  even as a very small step. We're about to take a break in a moment. Just go up to someone who's from a different culture  a different country  a different ethnicity    some difference    and engage them in a conversation. Listen to them. That's a third side act. That's walking Abraham's Path. After a TED Talk  why not a TED Walk  So let me just leave you with three things. One is  the secret to peace is the third side. The third side is us. Each of us  with a single step  can take the world  can bring the world a step closer to peace. There's an old African proverb that goes   When spiderwebs unite  they can halt even the lion.  If we're able to unite our third side webs of peace  we can even halt the lion of war. Thank you very much.
